UPON 

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. "S. NATIONAL MUSEUM 
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895. 

BY 

G. Brown Goode, 
Assiistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in ckar<ic of U. S. Xational Museum. 



L— GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 

By act of Congress passed in 1846 the Smithsonian Institution became 
the only lawful place of deposit for " all objects of art and of foreign 
and curious research, aiul all objects of natural history, plants, and 
geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States." 
These collections have served as a nucleus for the National Museum 
of the XTnited States. For many years this Museum was supported 
entirely at the expense of the Smithsou fund, and a considerable por- 
tion of the collections is the property of the Institution through gift or 
purchase. 

A "museum" has been defined by Professor Huxley as " a consultative 
library of objects." Not only is the National Museum such a consulta- 
tive library, but it is an agency for the instruction of the people of the 
whole country. It keei)S in mind the needs of those whose lives are not 
occupied in the study of science, as well as of the teacher and the skilled 
investigator. Its benefits are extended without cost or reserve to luiu- 
dreds of thousands of visitors from all parts of the United States who 
enter its halls every year, and through the distribution of the duplicate 
specimens in the Museum, made up into sets and accurately named, to 
public institutions in all parts of the country. 

Among the most important features of the operations of the Museum 
during the year may be mentioned the reorganization of the exhibits in 
several of the departments, notably in the departments of mammals 
and prehistoric anthropology. Entire rearrangement of these collec- 
tions has been effected, with a very gratifying result. 

A large number of the curators have been necessarily engaged in the 
preparation of exhibits for the Atlanta Exposition. This work lias^ of

course, interfered seriously with the realization of tlie plans previously 
laid out by them for the development of their respective departments. 
Several curators were absent from the Museum for a considerable 
portion of the year. Two were detailed by the Museum to cooperate 
with the United States Fish Commission in certain special investiga- 
tions of aquatic life off the coast of Alaska, and others Avere absent 
iu the field for several months. 

A.— OKICxIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSEUM. 

The history of the origin and development of the Museum has been 
detailed iu previous reports, and was made the special subject of a 
paper entitled " The Genesis of the National Museum." ^ For our pres- 
ent purpose it will suffice to repeat a few of the most essential facts as 
there stated. 

The formation of a national museum in the city of Washington was 
first undertaken by a society organized in 1840, called "The National 
Institution," and afterwards "The National Institute," which was for 
four years exceedingly i^rosperous and active. The nucleus for a 
national museum was gathered by this society in the Patent Office 
building in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider 
the establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the 
Government of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing 
the public recognition at which it aimed, the society became inactive, 
and eventually, iu ]8()1, passed out of existence. In the meantime the 
Smithsonian Institution had been organized, but from 1844 until 1858, 
when the so called "National Academy of Guriosities " passed into the 
charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the term "National Museum" 
was not in use. From that time onward it was used, unofficially, to 
designate the collections in the Smithsonian building. 

Iu January, 1847, the first Board of Eegents of the Smithsonian 
Institution, after many weeks of consultation and deliberation over the 
plans for organization, unanimously voted the following resolution: 

licsolved, That it is the iuteutiou of the act of Congress, and iu accoixlauce with 
the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes 
of executing the act and the trust is the accuiiiulatiou of collections of specimens 
and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual foriuation of a 
lilirarv of valiialde works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the 
end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and artmay bepro- 
videil, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall 
assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to 
the pursuit of any branch of kuowledge." 

After the "national cabinet" had been delivered to the Regents, 
annual appropriations were made by Congress for its maintenance. 
During the twenty-three years which followed, the collections were

greatly increased and weve made the basis of numerous important 
memoirs upon tlie natural history and ethnology of America. The 
public halls, with their arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of 
the collection, also received a due share of attention, and a certain 
amount of instruction and pleasure was aftbrded to visitors. The 
appropriations, however, were meager, the space limited, and the staif 
was so inadequate that little could be done except to keep the collec- 
tions in good preservation. 

The broad jilan upon which the operations of the National Museum 
are now conducted was anticipated as early as 1853, when Professor 
Henry wrote: 

There cau he little doubt that in due time ample provision will be made for a 
library and museum at the capital of this Union worthy of a Government whose 
jierpetuity depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the people.' 

The difficulties atteiidiug the formation of such a museum were 
appreciated by him, and in his report for 1849 he spoke with much 
emphasis of the difficulties attending the assuming by the Institution 
of the care of the national collections, and in the report of the Institu- 
tion for 1870' he again carefully expressed his opinion as to the aims 
l)roper to such a museum. 

There is [he wrote] scarcely any subject connected with science and 
education to which more attention is given at the present day than 
that of collections of objects of nature and art known under the gen- 
eral denomination of museums. This arises from their growing impor- 
tance as aids to scientific investigation and instruction. 

In the report for 1873^ allusion was made to the increase in the 
national collections, even then very great, ''requiring the utmost exer- 
tions of the limited force connected with the ISTational Museum for its 
proper treatment.'' 

Although the appropriations for the Museum have of late years been 
more liberal, it is certain that, on account of the immense annual 
increase in the quantity of material received, quite as much caution as 
ever is still needed in the development of its plans for the future. 

The Smithsonian Institution from its foundation fostered explora- 
tions, and its museum was enriched by the numerous ethnological 
and natural history objects brought home by the explorers. Many 
gifts were received from i^rivate sources, and valuable objects were 
deposited in its Museum for safe-keeping. The nucleus of its collec- 
tions was a small but valuable cabinet of minerals formed by the 
founder, James Smithson, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist 
of high repute, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. 

At the time of the establishment of the Institution several naval 
expeditions and surveys of the j)ublic domain were being organized bj-

the Goveniiiieiit, jiiul during their progress large collections of ethno- 
logical and natural history objects Avere made. Important foreign 
material was obtained by the Pa(!ific Exploring Expedition, Perry's 
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions, while the naturalists 
attached to the Pacific Eailroad Survey, the Mexican Boundary Sur- 
vey, and the surveys under the Army Engineer Corps, brought together 
great collections illustrating the natural resources and ethnology of 
North America. 

A new source of growth, subsequent to 1871, was the exploration of 
the waters of North America by the United States Fish Commission. 
The great collections of all forms of aquatic life made by the Commission 
found their way gradually into the National Museum, to be placed beside 
the collections of other bureaus of the Government engaged in scientific 
work. 

At the close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 the exhibits of the 
United States Government and those of numerous foreign governments 
and of private exhibitors came to the National Museum. 

A new period now began. The storage rooms and exhibition halls of 
the Smithsonian building were already overflowing with the accumula- 
tions of thirty years, and the small number of persons employed in caring 
for them were overburdened and unable properly to perform the requisite 
work. The limits of the collections had become wider, and a new and 
broader classification was found to be necessary. The growth of the 
country in wealth and culture had led to the establishment of many 
local museums, and the educational influences flowing from these and 
from the Centennial Exhibition caused a demand for more efficient 
methods of museum administration. The exhibition of 1870 had been 
indeed an event of great educational importance to the people of- the 
United States; and not the least of its good works was the lesson it 
taught as to the possibilities for good in j)ublic museums. 

The objects which at the close of the Centennial Exhibition were 
given to the United States for its National Museum were of large intrin- 
sic value, and were also very important from the fact that the necessity 
of caring for them led to the erection of a large building for the expansion 
of the Museum itself. 

In the early years Professor Baird, then assistant secretary of the 
Institution, with two or three assistants, had been able to give all nec- 
essary attention to the care of the collections, and the Museum had 
never been formally divided into departments. When the reorganiza- 
tion was made in 1881, under the immediate care of the present Assist- 
ant Secretary, the diversity of the collections made it necessary to 
establish a number of departments, each of which was placed in charge 
of a curator. 

There are now 28 organized departments and sections in the Museum, 
the larger number of which are in charge of specialists who receive no 
salary from the Museum. There are also 7 administrative offices.

SPECIAL EPOCHS IN THE HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM. 

The history of the Natiomil Museum may be divided into three 
periods : 

First, the period from tlie foundation of the Smithsonian Institution 
to 1857, during- which time specimens were collected solely to serve as 
materials for research. No special effort was made to exhibit them to 
the public or to utilize them, except as a foundation for scientific 
description and theory. 

Second, the period from 1857, when the institution assumed the cus- 
tody of the "National Cabinet of Curiosities," to 187(3. During- this 
period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific collections 
which had already been studied, these collections, so far as convenient, 
being" exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve 
an educational purpose. 

Third, the in^esent period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the 
Museum has undertaken more fully tlie additional task of gathering 
collections and exhibiting- them on account of their value from an 
educational standpoin t. 

During- the first period the main object of the Museum was scien- 
tific research; in the second, the establishment became a museum of 
record as well as of research; while in the third period has been added 
the idea of public education. The three ideas — record, research, and 
education — cooperative and mutually helpful as they are, are essential 
to the development of every great museum. The National Museum 
endeavors to promote them all. 

It is a museum of record^ in which are preserved the material founda- 
tions of an enormous amount of scientific knowledge — the types of 
numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those 
materials that have served as a foundation for the reports upon the 
resources of the United States. 

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in 
the highest degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scien- 
tific investigation. Research is necessary in order to identify and group 
the objects in the most philosophical and instructive relations, and its 
oflficers are therefore selected for their ability as investigators, as well 
as for their trustworthiness as custodians. 

It is an educational museum^ through its policy of illustrating by 
specimens every kind of natural object and every manifestation of 
human thought and activity, of displaying descriptive labels adapted 
to the popular mind, and of distributing its publications and its named 
series of duplicates. 

In conclusion let us review what seems to have been definitely accom- 
plished since the time of reorganization in 1881. 

The definite steps of progress may be summarized as follows: 

(1) An organization of the Museum stall" has been effected, efticient

for present purposes and capable of expansion and extensioji as occa- 
sion nuiy i'e(piire, and many capable museum experts have been trained 
for work in other institutions, 

(2) Through the ayeni^y of this staff the materials in the Mnseum, 
the accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, classi- 
fied, and brought nnder control and arranged in such manner as to 
insure their safety and make them available for study, 

(;>) Tlie collections have been increased nearly seventeen ibid during

EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. 

That the United States must have a National Museum worthy of the 
dignity of the nation is self-evident. 

Every country has a museum or group of museums in its capital 
city — centers of scientific and educational activity — the treasure-house 
of the i)eople, filled with memorials of national triumphs in the fields of 
science, art, and industrial progress.' 

These are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character 
of its museum and libraries intelligent persons, visiting a country, very 

' Most of tlie older nations have museums devoted to their military achievements 
and triiunphs, but our country has no need or desire to enter into this Held of Avork. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. -9 

properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the civili- 
zation of the i)eox)le. 

Washington may without question be made the seat of one of the 
greatest museums in the world. It may perhaps be neither practicable 
nor desirable to gather together in this city extensive collections of 
ancient medncval art, but a representative series of such objects will 
undoubtedly grow up which will tend to educate the public taste, 
promote the study of the elements of art and the history of civiliza- 
tion, and forward the arts of design. This having been accomplished, 
attention should be directed mainly toward the exhibition of the geol- 
ogy and natural history of America and its natural resources, to the 
preservation of memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the encour- 
agement of the arts and industries of our own people. 

It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of 
necessity have features i)eculiar to itself, developed in response to the 
peculiar needs of the people of this continent. It shoidd be remem- 
bered that the national collections of every principal European nation 
are divided into several groups, each under separate administration, 
though often within the general control of some central authority. In 
France, for instance, most of the nuiseums are under the Ministry of 
Public Instruction, and in England, to a less extent, under the Depart- 
ment of Science and Art. 

In the great capitals of Europe the public collections are scattered 
through various parts of the same city, in museums with distinctive 
names and indei)endent in their organizations. Much of the work 
which should properly be done by such museums is omitted, because 
no one of them has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand, 
much labor is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate — col- 
lections of similar scope and purpose being maintained in different 
parts of the same city. One of the chief objections to such division 
of effort is that much of the value of large collections in any depart- 
ment is lost by failure to concentrate them where they may be studied 
and compared side by side. In Washington, the national collections 
are all, without exception, concentrated in one group of buildings. 
The Army Medical Museum now occupies a building side by side with 
those under the control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this prox- 
imity, in connection with the long established policy of cooperation 
between the two organizations, renders them, for all i^ractical purposes, 
united in interest. 

Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the main- 
tenance of the National Museum are small, compared with those in 
several European countries, the value of objects given by private indi- 
viduals is proportionately large. The actual value of such contribu- 
tions for ten years past has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000 
a year, and in some years it has been greater. 



10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Amoug importaut gifts may be meutioned the George Catlin Indian 
gallery, of inestimable value to the American liistorian and ethnologist; 
the collection of North American insects, given by Prof. C. V. Riley; 
the collection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Dr. Isaac Lea, of Phila- 
delphia, containing, besides minerals and other objects, about 20,000 
conchological specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; the 
collections of mollusks, gems, and precious stones presented by the Rev. 
L. T. Chamberlain and Mrs. Frances Lea Chamberlain; the large and 
valuable collections of African mammals, birds, etc., made and presented 
by Dr. W. L. Abbott and Mr. William Astor Chanler; the Bendire and 
Ralph collections of American birds' eggs, given to the Smithsonian 
Institution ; the Lacoe collection of fossil plants, and the collection of 
the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transfer of which 
from Philadelphia to Washington a special appropriation was made by 
Congress. 

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Europe 
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution, which have not 
yet come into its possession. It is estimated that within the past fifteen 
years individuals to the number of more than 2,000 have made gifts to 
the Museum to the value of $100 each or more. 

The National Museum now contains nearly three and a half millions 
of objects. 

The intrinsic value of such collections as these can not well be ex- 
pressed in figures. There are single specimens worth hundreds, others 
worth thousands of dollars, and still others which are unique and jirice- 
less. Many series of specimens, which owe their value to their com- 
pleteness and to the labor Avhich has been expended on them, can not 
be replaced at any price. The collections at a forced sale would realize 
more than has been expended on them, and a fair appraisal of their 
value would amount to several millions of dollars. 

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the 
manuer in which its collections are increasing. In 1895 the number of 
specimens is almost eighteen times as great as in 1882. 

In the direct purchase of specimens but little money has been spent, 
less perhaps in fifty years than either France, England, Germany, or 
Austria expends in a single year on similar objects. The entire 
Museum is the outgrowth of Government expeditions and expositions, 
and of the gifts prompted by the generosity of the American people. 

As nn'ght be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given 
are duplicates of material already on hand, and although these contri- 
butions can, with the utmost advantage, be used for distribution to 
museums and schools, they do not materially increase the a alue of the 
collections for study ])y specialists and for general educational pur- 
poses. 

The need of a larger fund for the purchase of specimens is yearly be- 
coming more manifest. Exceedingly important material is constantly

ofteied at prices very unicli below what it would cost to obtain it by 
collectiii<i-, and in many instances, when refused, it is ea.i>erly taken 
by the niuseunis and institutions of Europe. 

The Museum in its present condition may be compared to a book 
from which pages here and there have be<'n omitted, so that the narra- 
tive is disjointed and incomplete. 

The museums of England are rich with the accumulations of centu- 
ries. The National Museum of the United States is youug, and has 
enormous deficiencies in every department. In needs, more than any 
museum in Europe, the opportunity to increase its resources through 
j)urchase. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens 
for the National Museum since 1889 has averaged less than $6,000 a 
year. 

For the purchase of specimens for tlie South Kensington Museum, 
from 1853 to 1887, $1,586,634 was expended, or a yearly average of 
nearly $47,000. 

Toward her other museums England is equally liberal. Exact sta- 
tistics are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that her 
average expenditures for the purchase of new objects for museums in 
London is not less than $500,000 a year. 

Our museum is the result of the activities of an enlightened Govern- 
ment. Through a thousand channels materials for the formation of a 
museum come into the possession of the Government, and out of such 
materials our museum has been built. A museum formed in this man- 
ner, however, suffers sooner or later from immense accumulations of 
objects of certain kinds and from the absence of others. This is true 
of the National Museum. At the outset no additions were unwelcome, 
and the expectation that all important deficiencies would be supplied, 
might i)roperly be indulged in. As the years have passed, however, it 
has l)ecome more and more apparent that many of these deficiencies 
can be supplied only by purchase. 

More striking present results might certainly have been attained by 
limiting the developments of the Museum to special fields. We have, 
however, had in view the future as well as the present, aiul no object 
has been refused a place in the Museum which is likely to be needed, 
even in the remote future, in the development of whatc^ver grand 
museum plans the nation may ultimately be willing to promote. 

]i._OEGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM. 

The National Museum is under the charge of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Eegents of 
the Institution. 

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the ^'keeper 
of the Smithsonian ]\Iuseum,'' and the Assistant Secretary, by the usage 
of nearly fifty years, its executive head. 



12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Ill the act of Cougress passed in 184G, to establisli the Smithsonian 
Institution, are contained tlic following- provisions concerning the scope 
of the museum to be placed under its charge: 

1. The act above referred to provides that "all objects of art and 
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, 
plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or 
hereafter to belong-, to the United States, which may be in the city 
of Washington,'' shall 1)6 delivered to the liegents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, and together -with new specimens obtained by 
exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classi- 
fied as best to facilitate examination and study. 

2. It provides that, in proportion as suitable arrangements can 
be made for their reception, these objects shall be delivered to such 
persons as may be authorized by the Board of Ivegents to receive 
them, 

3. It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so 
classified as best to facilitate their examination and study. 

4. It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building- to 
be inclosed for tlie Institution. 

5. It authorizes the liegents to obtain new specimens, by exchange 
of duplicate specimens and by gift, and directs also that they shall 
be ap])ropriately classified and arranged. 

The National Museum thus became the authorized place of deposit 
for all objects of art, archiieology, ethnology, natural historj^, miner- 
alogy, geology, etc., belonging to the United States or collected by any 
agency whatsoever for the Government of the United States, when no 
longer needed for investigations in progress. 

The collections in the Museum are intended to exhibit the natural 
and industrial resources, primarily of the United States and secondarily 
of other parts of the world, for purposes of comparison. 

The activitiesof the Museum are exerted especially in three directions: 

1. The permanent preservation of the collections already in its posses- 
sion, which depends chiefiy upon the vigilance of the curators and the 
skill of the preparators. 

2. The increase of the collections, which are acquired — 

(1) From the various (lovernment surveys and expeditions, in 
accordance witli law; 

(2) By gift from individuals, from other institutions, and from 
foreign Governments; 

(3) By exchange for its duplicate specimens or ibr publications; 

(4) By the eftbrts of ofiticers of the Museum, who make collections 
in connection with their regular duties, or are detailed for special 
service of this nature; 

(5) By purchase, when appropriations are made by Congress for 
that purpose. 

3. The utilization of the collections, which is effected by exhibiting 
them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on the part oi 
the officers of the Museum and other suitable persons, and facilitating 
the publication of the results ; also by the distribution to other museums 
and educational institutions of duplicate specimens, whi(!h have formed 
the basis of scientific investigation, these being identified and labeled 
by the best authorities. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13 

The collections of the JSTatioiial Museum are made up to a very lar^e 
extent of the following- materials: 

1. The natural history and anthropological collections accumu- 
lated since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of 
the Smithsonian Institution. 

2. Collections which have resulted from explorations carried on 
more or less directly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, or resulting from explorations carried on by the Smithsonian 
Institution in connection with educational institutions or commercial 
establishments. 

3. Collections which have been obtained through the courtesy of 
the Department of State and the cooperation of United States 
ministers and consuls. 

4. The collection of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the Perry 
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions. 

5. Collections made by the scientific officers of Government sur- 
veys, such as the Pacific llailroad Survey, the Mexican Bound- 
ary Snrvey, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of 
the United States Army and by officers of the Signal Corps of the 
United States Army stationed in remote regions. 

6. Collections obtained by the United States Geological Survey, 
the United States Fish Commission, and those resulting from the 
activities of the United States Department of Agriculture and 
other departments of the Government. 

7. The remnant of the collections of the old "Is'^ational Institute." 

8. The collections made by the United States to illustrate the 
animal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of 
the native races of the country on the occasion of the Centennial 
Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876; the fishery collections displayed 
by the United States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at 
Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, and the collections obtained 
from various local expositions, as, for instance, the ^exv Orleans 
Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati 
Exposition in 1887, and the World's Columbian Exposition in 
1893. 

9. The collections given by the Governments of the several foreign 
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at 
Philadelphia in 187G. 

10. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing 
and commercial houses of Europe and America at the time of the 
Philadelphia Exhibition and subsequently. 

11. The materials received from mnseums in Europe and America 
in exchange for dnplicate specimens. 

12. Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange from 
individuals, numbering usually from 1,000 to 1,500 each year. 

The publications of the Museum consist of — 

1. The Annual Eeport. 

2. The Proceedings of the National Museum. 

3. The Bulletin of the National Museum. 

4. The series of circulars. 

Papers by members of the Museum staff' based upon the collections 
have been printed in every scientific periodical in the United States 
and in many of those of Europe. 



14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

The Sinithsoniiiii Institution, although it bears the name of a for- 
eigner, lias for hiilf a century been one of the most important agencies 
in the intellectual life of our people. It has been a rallying point for 
the workers in every department of scientitic and educational work, 
and the chief agency for the free exchange of books, apparatus of 
research, and of scientific intelligence between this and other coun- 
tries. Its publications, which include more than two hundred volumes, 
are to be found in all the important libraries in the world, and some of 
them, it is safe to say, on the work-table of every scientitic investigator. 
Its great library constitutes an integral and very important part of the 
national collection at the Capitol, and its Museum is the richest in 
existence in many branches of the natural history and ethnology of 
the New World. Many wise and enlightened scholars have given their 
best years to its service, and some of the most eminent men of science 
to whom our country has given birth, have passed their entire lifetime 
in working for its success. 

Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have 
worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by 
its system of international exchange, by means of which within the 
past forty-three years nearly one and a half million packages of books 
and other scientific and literary materials have been distributed to 
every region of the earth, it has acquired a reputation at least as far- 
reaching as that of any other institution of learning in the world. 

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the 
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun- 
tries of American art and literature, or of American institutions 
generally, the science of America is everywhere accepted as sound, 
vigorous, and i)rogressive. 

In the scientific journals of Great Britain and other Euro])ean coun- 
tries the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific publi- 
cations of the Smithsonian, tlie Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the 
Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Com- 
mission, and they are constantly holding uj) the Government of the 
United States as an example of what governments should do for the 
support of their scientific institutions. 

It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work 
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by other nations, and it 
is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can 
be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, nor more in 
accord with the injunction of Washington in his Farewell Address, 
admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as president of 
the British Association for the Advancement of Science: 

Promote, then, as an object of prvmary importance, in.stitntions for the 
tjvneral di fusion of Icnowledge. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15 

In proportion <i.s the sirxcture of a f/ovcyitmeiit f/ires J'orce to puhlie 
opinion^ it should he eiilifihtened. 

jSTo one has yet explained, exeept by eoiijeeture, wliy James Smithsoii 
selected the United States as the seat of his foandation. He had no 
acquaintances in. America, nor does he appear to have had any books 
relating to America except two. Ehees quotes from one of these (Trav- 
els through North America, by Isaac Weld, secretary of the Royal Soci- 
ety) a paragraph concerning Washington, then a small town of 5,000 
inhabitants, in which it is predicted that "the Federal city, as soon 
as navigation is perfected, will increase most rapidly," and that, at a 
future day, if the affairs of the United States go on as prosperously 
as they have done, it will become the grand emporium of the West and 
rival in magnitude and splendor the cities of the Old World. 

Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, realiz- 
ing that while the needs of England were well met by existing organi- 
zations, such as would not be likely to spring up for many years in a 
new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England an 
institution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of incal- 
culable value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the 
United States would have been today without this bequest? 

Well did President John Quincy Adams say: 

Of all the foimdations of estahlishments for pious or charitable uses 
which ever signalized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive heneficence 
of the founder^ none can he named more deserving the approhation of 
manlxind. 

The most important service by far which the Smithsonian Institution 
has rendered to the nation has been that extended from year to year 
since 184G — intangible but none the less appreciable — by its constant 
cooperation with the (lovernment, public institutions, and individuals 
in every enterjirise, scientific or educational, which needed advice, 
support, or aid from its manifold resources. 

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the 
extent of which can not fail to impress anyone who will look at them. 
The most important of these are the library and the Museum, which 
have grown up under its fostering care. 

THE LIBRARY. 

The library has been accumulated without aid Irom the Treasury of 
the United States. It has, in fact, been the result of an extensive 
system of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been 
used to obtain similar ])ublications from institutions of learning in all 
parts of the world. 

The value of the books distributed since the Institution was opened 
must have been nearly $1,000,000, or nearly twice the original bequest 
of Smithson.^ Many of the publications in each of these series are now 
out of print. 



' Tliis estimate is based upon the prices which are charged for the books by second- 
hand dealers, as shown in tlieir sale catalogues. 



16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

In return for these, and by purchase, it has received the great col- 
lection of books which forms its library and which is one of the richest 
in the world in tlie publications of learned societies, and therefore of 
inestimable value, containing, as it does, the record of actual progress 
in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of the 
human family, and attbrding tlie means (»f tracing the history of every 
branch of positive science since the days of the revival of letters until 
the present time. This library was, in 1865, deposited at the Capitol, 
as a portion of the Congressional Library. 

The vSmithsonian Collection, which includes more than three hundred 
thousand volumes and parts of volumes, (constituting i)erhaps one- 
fourth of the National Library, is to be installed in a special hall of its 
own upon the main floor of the new Library Building. The rapidity 
with which it is increasing is indicated by the fact that in the last two 
years 67,589 titles were added.' 

The Institution has probably done more toward building up a great 
library in Washington than would have been i^ossible, had all its income 
been devoted strictly to library work, as was at one time seriously 
proposed. 

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though their 
number has been so largely increased, year by year, now forming one 
of the most valuable collections of the kind in existence, they not only 
remain unbound, but in a far more crowded and inaccessible condition 
than they were before the transfer, a condition of affairs which it is 
hoped will soon be remedied. 

The i)urchasing power of the publications of the Institution, when 
ottered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit 
is exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a con- 
siderable extent in behalf of the National Museum. 

The amount expended during the past forty years from the private 
fund of the Institution in the publication of books for gratuitous dis- 
tribution has been fully half as much as tbe original Smithson bequest. 

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways; 
but, in addition to this, a library much more than e(iual in value to the 
outlay has, through their buying power, come into the possession of 
the nation. 

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired 
for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the 
Smithsonian Institution. The value of the collections thus acquired is 
estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson 
bequest. 

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library. 
It was not until 1858 that it became the authorized depository of the

distinct from the general Smithsonian library and aro separately administered. All 
of these are placed at the service of advanced students and specialists. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17 

scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after 187(5 
that it was officially reorganized as the National Museum of the IJiiited 
States. 

But for the provident forethought of the Smithsonian Institution, 
the United States would probably still be without a reputable nucleus 
lor a national museum. 

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for 
many years established in Washington, which replaces the old Smith- 
sonian courses, once so influential, and the assistance which it affords 
each year to students of science, are referred to elsewhere in this 
report. 

The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scien- 
tific subjects, which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to 
make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. In addi- 
tion to this, a large correspondence is carried on with people in search of 
information on scientific toi^ics. Probably not less than 7,500 letters a 
year go out to people who write seeking to know the name of some object 
or other scientific fact. Inquiries of this kind are always answered 
promptly and fnlly; and frequently, to intelligent inquirers, books are 
sent which will enable them to find out such names for themselves in 
future. This work has not only an educational value, but often a great 
economic importance as well, as, for instance, when some common min- 
eral has been mistaken for one of value, some useless jilant has been 
wrongly identified and supposed to be of service in medicine, or some 
harmless animal feared as noxious. 

The i^ublications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every 
State and almost every county in the United States. A careful study 
of the subject, recently made by the president of one of the scientific 
societies in Washington, seems to indicate that there are several States 
which are reached by no scientific publications whatever except those 
distributed gratuitously by the Government. 

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the 
Museum or any other trust which it administers, it may be positively 
stated that in the execution of the trust of Smithson more has been 
given to the Government than has been received. The maciiinery of the 
Institution's action has been such that it has incidentally, in connec- 
tion with its legitimate work for the increase and diffusion of knowl- 
edge, paid over to the Government the equivalent of nnich more than 
the whole original fund. 

The present Secretary has pointed out that "although by the judi- 
cious administration of the Smithson fund nearly $1,500,000, the fruits 
of its investment, have been applied during the past forty years to the 
advancement of science and education in America (in addition to the 
principal, $911,000, larger now than ever before), it should be remem- 
bered that the unrestricted income of the Institution is less than 
NAT MUS 95 2 



18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

$G0,00() ji year, a sum iiiucli sinallor in its power to eflect results than 
ever in previous years." 

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement 
liberally tliis private contribution for public good, especially if it be 
borne in mind that, as Secretary Langley has shown, the Institution 
has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone, prop- 
erty acquired out of its private fund which is now more than equal in 
value to the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest? 

Every museum has its special characteristics growing out of its form 
of organization, its location, scope, and financial and other resources. 
The character of the National Museum is fundamentally affected by its 
connection with the Smithsonian Institution, its dependence upon Con- 
gress for appropriations annually, and the necessity, under existing 
laws, of its caring for all collections belonging to the Government. 

Of the connection of the Museum with the Smithsonian Institution, 
it should be said that it is in the highest degree advantageous. It 
should be borne in mind that it is essentially a Smithsonian museum, 
since, especially in its earlier liistory, the Institution expended large 
sums of money in aiding explorations, Avith the distinct purpose of 
increasing the collections in certain directions, while of late years 
it has deposited all the valuable gifts and bequests of specimens it 
has re(;eived. It has had in addition, for nearly half a century, the 
use of the larger portion of the Smithsonian building, and, what is of 
paramount importance, the guidance and influence of the officers 
of the Institution, and the very valuable assistance of its numerous 
corres])ondents. 

C— THE WORK OF THE MUSETTM IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. 

The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an 
institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to 
justify its maintenance and extension. The Museum, however, not 
only performs these functions, but also does a very great deal to render 
the resources of science available to the public at large. 

The National Museum is a treasure-house filled with materials for the 
use of investigators, and it is also an agency for the instruction of the 
people of the whole country. 

In a recent address before the American Historical Association, I 
attempted to explain the idea of our work as follows: 

(1) That public institutions of learning are not intended for the few, 
but for the enlightenment and education of the masses. 

(2) That the public lias a right to full participation in the results of 
the work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to 
maintain. 

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these institutions 
is to provide means by which such results may be presented in an 
attractive as well as an intelligible form. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19 

No scientific iustitution is more thoroughly committed to the work of 
the diftasiou of knowledge tlum is the Smithsonian Institution, and no 
department of its activity has greater possibilities in this respecit than 
the National Museum. 

Tlie benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists 
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors from all 
parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local 
institutions and their visitors throughout the country, througli tlie dis- 
tribution of the duplicate specimens in the Museum, which are made 
u}) into sets, accurately named, and distributed to schools and museums. 

In the next annual report it will be shown how many hundred thou- 
sands of objects have been thus distributed during the past twenty 
years. Every museum in the United States has profited in this way, 
and by its system of exchange the Museum has, while enriching itself, 
contributed largely to the stores of every important scientific museum 
in the world. 

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other 
ways. Within the last year many local museums in the United States 
were supplied with working plans of cases in use in the Museum, and 
similar sets of plans have been supplied within the past few years to 
national museums in other countries. 

Not only do tlie people of the country at large profit by the work of 
the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but also to a 
very considerable extent directly and personally. 

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an 
authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole staff 
of experts is thus placed, without cost, at the service of every citizen. 

It is much to be regretted that many specialists, intent chiefiy upon 
the study of certain scientific problems in which they individually are 
absorbed, are disposed to neglect the claims of the educated public to 
the enjoyment and instruction which museums afibrd. They do not 
hesitate to say that scientific museums should be administered for the 
benefit solely of persons engaged in research. Such men would find 
no welcome among us. 

The experience of Euroi)e, with its magnificent public museums and 
the history of the several expositions in the United States, should be 
quite sufficient to satisfy anyone who has studied the matter, that the 
museum is an educational ]>ower even more intiuential than the ]>ublic 
library. 

The venerable director of the South Kensington Museum, the late Sir 
Phili]) Cunliffe Owen, speaking from an experience of thirty-five years, 
not oidy in his own establishment, but in the work of building up the 
score of affiliated museums in the various provincial towns of Great 
Britain, remarked to the writer: 

Wo ediicato our worlcing people in the public scliools, j?ive tliem a love for refined 
and l)eaiitiful objects, aud stimulate in tlieui a desire for information. They leave 
school, go iuto the pursuits of town life, and have no means provided for the 



20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18!r). 

griitilication of the tastes which they have been forced to ac»iniro. It in as much 
the duty of the tiovorunieut to provide thcin with museums and libraries for their 
higher educatiou as it is to establish schools for their jirimary instruction. 

Ill tlie same couversation Sir Philip insisted very strongly that a 
museum not actually engaged in educational work of some kind could 
not long survive, pointing to the great system of lectures and exam- 
inations connected with the Science and Art Department of the Council 
of Education, of which the South Kensington Museum was one of the 
chief agencies. 



II.— SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR. 

The changes already made in the form of the Annual Eeport, bejrin- 
ning with the volume for 1893, have been continued in this volume. It 
is believed that they have proved advantageous in many ways. 

The most important innovation in Part i of this Re])ort is the 
Appendix which relates to the statement concerning the Library of tlie 
National Museum. This consists of a complete list of all accessions 
to the library during the year 1894-95, but does not include books 
belonging to the Smithsonian library which have been withdrawn for the 
purposes of the National Museum. 

The headings which follow indicate the topics which are thought to 
be of special importance in connection with both the scientific and 
administrative operations of the Museum during the year. 

THE MUSEUM STAFF. 

The number of organized departments and sections in the Museum 
is now 28. There are 7 administrative divisions. 

Hon, Charles D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological 
Survey, has been appointed honorary curator of all the paleontological 
collections, which are now embraced in the department of paleontology. 
The names of those in charge of the various sections of this department 
are mentioned in Appendix i. 

Mr. J. E. Watkins was appointed curator of the technological 
collections in February, 1895. 

In May Dr. J. M. Flint, U. S. N., was detailed by the Secretary of 
the Navy to serve again as honorary curator of the section of materia 
medica in the National Museum, {hus relieving Medical Inspector 
Daniel Mc:Murtrie, TT. S. N. 

Mr. F. W. True and Dr. Leonhard Steineger were detailed in the 
spring of 1895 to report to the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries 
for the purpose of accompanying an expedition to Alaska and the 
adjacent islands, with a view to studying the seal rookeries. They were 
temporarily transferred to the roll of the Fish Commission for this 
work. 

On July 1, 1894, Mr. R. E. Earll was appointed editor of the Pro- 
ceedings and Bulletins of the Museum. Later in the year he was 
appointed special agent on behalf of the Museum for the Cotton States 

and International Exposition to be held at Atlanta.

22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 189.-). 

Dr. Theodore dill and Dr. \l. K. ('. Stearns are now recognized as 
Associates in /ooloi;y, Dr. C. A. AVhite, in paleontology, and Dr. II. W. 
Sbufeldt, in comparative anatomy. 

Tu Jannary Dr. G. V. Merrill was detailed for special duty in the 
office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. 

Mr. F. 11. Knowlton resigned on July o, 1894, although he is still 
connected with the Museum in an honorary capacity as custodian of 
mesozoic ]»lants. 

During the year Dr. .1. N. Kose, of the Department of Agriculture, 
was appointed honorary assistant curator of the department of botany 
in tlie jMuseum, and Mr. E. S. Matthews was appointed an aid in the 
department of mammals. 

On October 1, 1S()4, Dr. Walter Hough was appointed assistant 
curator of the department of ethnology; Mr. Charles W. Eichmond was 
appointed an assistant in the department of birds on July 1 of the same 
year, and on November 1 Miss M. J. Eathbun, connected with the 
department of marine invertebrates, was made an assistant curator. 

Mr. Charles T. Simi)son was designated assistant in charge of the 
department of mollusks on May 1 7, during the absence in Alaska of 
Dr. Dall, honorary curator. 

ACCESSIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS. 

The accession entries relating to material received during the year 
have occupied Nos. 28312 to 29534, inclusive, giving a total of 1,223 
separate lots. This is an increase of 62 over the preceding year, and 
any increase is the more remarkable from the fact that with very few 
exceptions no effort whatever has been made to induce persons to 
deposit their collections in the National Museum. This undesirable 
l)olicy has been made necessary by the entire lack of additional exhibi- 
tion space. The material received during tlie year has for the most part 
been placed in storage, It amounts to 127,324 specimens of all kinds. 
The three departments receiving the largest increases were prehistoric 
anthropology, mollusks, and insects. An effort has been made to 
obtain from the curators iigures representing the number of specimens 
received during the year, as well as the total number of specimens in 
their departments on June 30, 1895. The appended tables, A and B, 
show the results. It is shown that there are now 3,4(K3,855 specimens 
of all kinds in the custody of the Museum. 

The table indicating in parallel columns the totals in the different 
departments at the end of each year since 1882 has been withdrawn, as it 
was found that without numerous footnotes it was impossible to account 
for the discrepancies which appeared to exist from a comparison of the 
totals of one year with another in the light of the table giving the num- 
ber of specimens received in each department during the year. This 
last number added to the total for the previous year seldom gave the 
actual total for the year following, on account of specimens withdrawn 
for distribution and otherwise disposed of. On the other hand, as in 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 



23 



the department of geology, tlie total for a given year was liable to 
exceed the total for the previous year by more tlian tlic number repre- 
senting the specimens obtained during the year. This might be readily 
accounted for by the fact that one large specimen u]>on its arrival 
would not unfrequently be broken into a large number of smaller ones. 
Hence the necessity for numerous explanatory notes arose, and for this 
reason the arrangement of these tables, as here given, will bo ado])ted 
in future reports of the Museum.

TRANSFER OF THE NATIONAL HERBARIUM. 

In 1860 the ISTational Herbarium was transferred from the Smithsonian 
Institution to the Department of Agriculture. The reasons for this 
transfer are given under the head of "Review of work in the scientific 
departments.'" Within the last year, however, a formal communication 
was received from the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture proposing 
that the Herbarium be again housed by the Smithsonian Institution. 
The reasons for the desired change are given in the letter of the Assist- 
ant Secretary of Agriculture, dated July 21, 1891, which is reprinted 
in the chapter referred to above. The proposition was agreed to by the 
Smithsonian Institution, and the actual transfer of the Herbarium took 
place in September of the same year.

EXCHANGES OF SPECIMENS ^riTII INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS 

ABROAD. 

The Museum has for many years maintained exchanges of specimens 
not only with domestic institutions but also, and chiefly, with foreign 
museums. This practice has enabled the Museum to dispose profita- 
bly of its duplicates, and at the same time to furnish museums and 
colleges in other countries with valuable American material for display 
or study. The Museum has exchange relations with almost every 
museum of importance in the world. Exchanges of specimens not infre- 
quently lead to exchanges of publications also, and by this means the 
Museum library has received numerous accessions. Especially has this 
been the case since 1894, when a special effort was made to obtain from 
foreign museums publications which at that time were wanting on our 
shelves. 

The exchanges of si)ecimens with institutions at home are so indicated 
in the Accession List, which is printed as Api)endix ii. The exchanges 
with foreign museums and other institutions and individuals abroad 
are here briefly referred to.

COOJ'ERATION OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OP THE GOVERNMENT; 

The large annual increase in the national collections is due in no 
small degree to the aid which the Executive Departments of the Gov 
crnment have extended in various ways. Much valuable assistance 
has also been rendered by officials of the Departments who have found 
it practicable to perform certain work in the interest of the ]\luseum 
witlnmt interfering Avith their official duties. 

In the Department of State, Hon. W. W. Rockhill, who has made 
very liberal contributions to the collection in past years, is one of the 
warmest friends of the Museum. Mr. R. I). L. Mohun, of the Consular 
Bureau, has i)resented a large and valuable collection of ethnological 
objects from the Kongo region. Mr. Isaac Townsend Snn'th has been 
instrumental, in his capacity of consul-general of Siam, in forwarding 
to the Museum, in behalf of the King- of Siam, through his Royal 
Highness Prince Devagongse Varaprakar, minister of fcn-eign affairs, 
Bangkok, Siam, a Siamese edition of the sacred writing "Tripitaka"

States consul at Cape Town, Africa; Mr. X. C. Gram, United States 
consular ayent at Dryefjord, Iceland, have also extended their friendly 
offices in increasing' the collections. 

The 3Iusemn is indebted to the Treasury Department for the prompt 
manner in which free entry lias been granted for material obtained 
irom many parts of tlie world. This courtesy has been extended over 
a long period of years. 

Lieut. J. H. Scott and Mr. Sheldon Jackson, of the Revenue-Marine 
Service, have given their personal aid in adding to the collections. 

Mr. Isaac Winston, of the United States Coast and (reodetic Survey, 
has also been a contributor. 

In the War Department the same friendly spirit of cooperation has 
been manifested. The Quarter-masters Department has saved the 
Museum both time and money in connection with the transportation to 
Washington of heavy material from remote localities. Several Army 
officers have made contributions of interesting specimens totheMnseum. 
Among these are Capt. P. H. Ivay, Lieut. W. "N". Hughes, Lieut. Wirt 
Robinson, Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, Dr. Timothy E. Wilcox, and Dr. C. E. 
Woodruff. In the same way the Musenm is indebted to several officers 
of the Xavy for addition to the collections — Rear- Admiral R. W. Meade, 
Lieut. Charles Emmericdi, Lieut. C. H. Harlow, and Lieut. Herbert 
Wiiislow. In the latter part of May, 189."), Dr. James M. Flint was 
again assigned to <luty in the Museum as honorary curator of the sec- 
tion of materia medica, and the renewal of his official connection with 
the Museum is a source of sincere gratification. 

Tlider the Department of the Interior the principal accessions to 
the collections have been received through the (xeological Survey. 
The material thence derived is alluded to in the List of Accessions 
(Appendix ii). The following officers have extended personal as.sist- 
ance to the Museum during the year, either by collecting geological 
material or by cooperating with the geological work of the Museum: 
Mr. Whitman Cross, Dr. David T. Day, Mr. Frank Burns, Mr. J. S. 
Diller, Mr. G. H. Eldridge, Mr. S. F. Emmons, Mr. Arnold Hague, 
Mr. W. P. Jenney, Mr. F. H. Knowlton, Prof. S. L. Penfield, lAIr. W. 
Sardeson, Mr. J. E. Spurr, Mr. T. W. Stanton, Mr. W. H. Turner, and 
Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan. 

The Director of the Survey, Mr. Charles D. Walcott, has assumed 
charge of the paleontological department of the Museum, an arrange- 
ment which can not fail to redound greatly to the advantage of the 
latter. Dr. William H. Dall, Prof. Lester F. Ward, and Prof. F. W. 
Clarke, officers of the Survey, continue to act as honorary curators in 
the ]\fuseum, and to their active and earnest cooperation is due to a 
large extent the progress which has been made in the geological work 
of the Museum. 



32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Dr. Z. T. Daniel, of the ludiau Office, lias made several valuable 
gifts of etLmologi(;al material to tlie Museum during tlie year. Dr. 
William J. Elstuu, of the Pension Office, lias also been a contributor. 

Several collections Lave been transferred to the Museum by the Fish 
Commission. From the material received from this source a large 
number of specimens have been distributed to educational institutions 
throughout the country, over fifty collections having been sent out 
during the year. 

Prof. B. W. Evermann, Dr. Hugh M. Smith, Mr. Charles H. Townsend, 
and Mr. C. W. Kendall have been personally instrumental in obtaining 
interesting material for the collections. 

A number of important accessions have been received from the 
Department of Agriculture. Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Mr. L. O. Howard, 
Dr. A. K. Fisher, Messrs. E. W. Nelson, C. L. Pollard, and Theo. Per- 
gande have rendered conspicuous assistance to the Museum. Prof. 
C. V. Eiley, Mr. F. V. Coville, and Dr. C. W. Stiles have continued to 
act in an honorary cajiacity. Many botanical collections are received 
direct by the Department of Agriculture. These are in due time 
incorporated with the National Herbarium according to law. The cir- 
cumstances which led to the transfer of the National Herbarium from 
the Department of Agriculture to the National Museum building are 
referred to at length in another place. 

The Bureau of Ethnology, a branch of the Smithsonian Institution, 
has transmitted large and valuable collections of ethnological objects 
from Indian tribes in different sections of the country. 

collectors' outfits. 

During the year outf ts have baen furnished to collectors as follows: 
To Mr. A. W. Eidgway, Point Lookout, Md.; to Capt. James P. Hare, 
Avery, La.; to Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, San Diego, Cal.; to Mrs. Con- 
stance McElroy, Livingston, Guatemala; to Mr. F. W. True, U. S. 
National Museum, for collecting in Alaska; to Mr. Frank C. Dennis, 
Livingston, Guatemala; to Eev. D. W. Snyder, Luebo, Congo Free 
State; to Mr. F. W. Urich, honorary secretary of the Trinidad Field 
Naturalists' Club, Port-of-Spain, British West Indies; to Mr. O. Bangs, 
Micco, Brevard County, Fla. ; to Mr. E. S. Matthews, U. S. National 
Museum, for collecting in West Virginia; to Prof. P. II. Eolfs, Florida 
Agricultural College, Lake City, Fla.; to Lieut. Wirt Eobinson, steam- 
ship Venezuela, Brooklyn, N. Y., and to Mr. William Palmer, U. S. 
National Museum, for use during a collecting trip in Florida. 

DEVELOPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE EXniBITION SERIES. 

The changes in the exhibition halls of the Museum have not been 
very extensive during the year. Most of the alterations were made 
with a view to exhibiting to better advantage the collections previously 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33 

iustalled, or for tlie purpose of making room for small, thougli in some 
cases important, collections or individual objects recently acquired. 

The collection illustrating the religions of eastern Asia (Brahmanism, 
Buddhism, and Shintoism) was installed and labels prepared for many 
of the objects. The collection of Assyrian seals and other small casts 
is now installed in four Kensington cases, and a number of objects 
relating to the Greco-Koman religion have also been placed upon exhi- 
bition. The casts of reliefs from Constantinople have been hung on 
the walls of the east hall, next to the rotunda. The collections of 
oriental antiquiti'^s and religious ceremonials now occupy two alcoves 
in the east hall and two in the west hall of the Museum building. 

That portion of the historical collection which is on exhibition is in 
good condition^ but there is still considerable work to be done in the 
way of labeling the specimens. Several pieces of apparatus used by 
Professor Henry in connection with his researches in electro-magnetism, 
which have for many years been in the custody of the Smithsonian 
Institution, were placed upon exhibition in the Museum during this 
year, together with other pieces of api)aratus deposited by Miss IVIary 
A. Henry. A special case is devoted to this apparatus. A rearrange- 
ment of the specimens in the boat hall is contemplated. On account 
of the limited space available for exhibition purposes, the collections 
illustrating the various stages in the development of the sewing machine 
and the typewriter have been placed in storage. 

The exhibition series of the department of paleontology in the south- 
east court has been rearranged, and the court again opened to the 
public. The former crowded condition of the room has been relieved, 
to some extent, by the removal of a portion of the slope-top cases. 
Thirty-two of these cases still remain, and in these is installed the col- 
lection of invertebrate fossils. The fossil plants and vertebrates are 
arranged in the wall cases. A few additional vertebrate fossils have 
been placed upon exhibition during the year, and a number of large 
casts secured to the walls or placed upon the tops of the wall cases. 
The collection of fossil insects occupies one flat top case, and the large 
slabs of tracks have been placed upon screens in the corners of the hall. 
The systematic collection of rocks has been entirely rearranged and 
the labels of the building-stone collection renewed. Over 200 photo- 
graphs were mounted and placed upon exhibition in the department 
of geology. Owing to lack of space, the permanent increase in the 
exhibition series in this department has been small. Better specimens 
are, however, being constantly substituted for less desirable ones. 
The mineral collection is being supplied as rapidly as ])ossible with 
individual and group labels. The cases have been numbered and an 
"arrangement label" has been prepared and put up, showing the scheme 
of arrangement of the collections. An educational series is in course 
of preparation. 

The exhibition hall oC the department of mamnuils has been entirely 
NAT MUS 95 13 



34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

rearranged and rendered more attractive. In carryinj^- out tlu' new 
arrani^ement the position of all of tlie movable cases was changed. 
The appearance of that portion of the collection installed in the wall 
cases is seriously diminished hy the fact that the mouuted specimens 
are so close together that th(^ light is obstructed, and in many cases 
little more than the heads and shoulders of the specimens can be seen. 
The Audnbon lithograpliic pictures of mammals, recently purchased 
by the Museum have been hung in the office of the curator, tempo- 
rarily. The series of interlocked antlers has been transferred to the 
de])artment of comparative anatomy to be incorporated in the osteo- 
logical collection. Labels have been made for the pori)oises arranged 
on top of the wall cases in the south hall. In the department of birds 
the exhibition series is in good condition. A limited numl)er of badly 
mouuted specimens have been remounted, and other specimens not 
suitable for exhibition have been replaced by better ones. Several 
months were spent in renovating the entire mounted collection, each 
S]x^ciinen being subjected to a process of cleaning, which, it is believed, 
will result in a material improvement in the appearance of the collec- 
tion. A few specimens liave been added to the exhibition series in the 
department of comparative anatomy during the year, and the entire 
exhibit is in good condition. The exhibition space in this department 
has been increased to a limited extent by placing cases between the 
piers above the wall cases. In the department of fishes the condition 
of the exhibition series remains the same as last year. In the depart 
ment of marine invertebrates five old-fashioned flat ebony cases have 
been replaced by mahogany cases, and the location of some of the 
other cases has been changed. The collection of tree snails from the 
Philippine Islands has been placed upon exhibition in the department 
of mollusks. 

Tlie exhibition series in the department of ethnology is embrace<l in 
two groups — the material actually on exhibition and the exhibition 
series returned from the World's Columbian Exposition. Owing to 
lack of room, the latter has been temporarily placed in storage. The 
work of setting up in the northwest court a special exhibit illustrating 
the ethnology of the Pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona has been 
carried on during the year. The change referred to last year in the 
arrangement of the exhibition hall of the department of i)rehistoric 
anthropology has been completed. All of the objects, contained in fifty- 
two cases, have been rearranged geographically by States and foreign 
countries. Twelve cases, containing objects made by or belonging to 
prehistoric man, have also been rearranged. In the wall cases on the 
north and west sides of the hall the objects from Mexico, the West 
Indies, and Central and South America liave been installed. The 
Pacific Coast objects have been segregated and installed in a case by 
themselves, and the mummies are now exhibited in the wall case on the 
south side of the hall. Two additional shelves have been provided in 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35 

euch alcove case, aud about ilOO specimens of luouiul pottery placed 
thereou. Large cases of pottery from Peru, Brazil, and the Arkansas 
mounds have been placed in the foyer of tlie ball. A case containing 
a group of Indian figures, and representing a (piarry workshop, has 
also been installed. A large number of paintings, drawings, litlio- 
graplis, and pliotogra])hs of prehistoric objects have been hung on the 
walls of the hall; also a map showing the linguistic stocks of North 
America, and a chronological map showing the distribution of aborigi- 
nal mound districts in the United States. Many additional labels have 
been provided for the specimens in the cases. 

LABELS. 

During the year there were printed 1,870 forms of labels, including 
171,544 copies. Of this number 242 forms, representing 82,568 labels, 
were printed at the Museum. There were also printed on the Museum 
press 57,406 envelopes, copies of blanks, etc., representing 28 forms, 
and at the Government Printing Office 558,100 copies, representing 29 
forms. 

LIBRARY. 

The accessions to the library during the past year have exceeded 
those of any previous year since its organization. Dr. Cyrus Adler, 
librarian, states that there were received by gift, i^urchase, and 
exchange 1,035 volumes, 2,255 parts of volumes, and 3,311 pamphlets, 
making a total of 6,601. This is an increase of more than 2,200 over 
the receii^ts for the year ending June 30, 1894. A complete list of the 
accessions by gift and exchange is printed in Appendix iii. There 
were retained for the use of the Museum from the accessions to the 
library of the Smithsonian Institution 133 books, 611) pamphlets, and 
7,451 parts of periodicals. About 1,600 books were bound during the 
year, two-thirds of this number belonging to the Museum aud the 
remainder to the Smithsonian deposit. 

The number of books borrowed was 6,110. A large number of books 
in the custody of the sectional libraries, which would have been recalled 
earlier but for the overcrowded condition of the library, have now been 
gathered in. This makes the number of books returned exceed by 
about 3,000 the number of books lent during the year. 

Extensive additions have been made to the series of jniblications of 
museums, of State agricultural colleges and experiment stations, scien- 
tific publications of the United States Government, and publications 
relating to early travel in North America. For the purpose of accom- 
modating these publications, and to relieve to some extent the crowded 
condition of the library, a set of bookshelves has been constructed at 
the west end of the lecture hall. 

The librarian states that the Museum is under obligations to the 
Library of Congress tor the same hearty cooperation which has been 
manifested in the past. 



36 



EEPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



The library Las been freely consulted by members of the Museum 
staff, by officials connected with several of the other scientific bureaus 
of the Governiacnt, by members of the various scientific societies of 
Washington, and by other specialists not connected with the Museum. 

A large amount of time has been devoted to a new classification of 
the books and pamphlets. This work was nearly completed at the 
close of the fiscal year, notwithstanding the large increase of work in 
matters of routine. The transfer of the catalogue to cards of the 
standard library form was commenced in the early part of the year. 
Up to the present time about 4,500 cards belonging to this catalogue 
have been filled out. 

There are now 21 sectional lil)raries. These are designated as follows :

PUBLICATIONS. 

The bill relating to the printing, binding, and distribntion of pnblic 
documents ap])roved January 12, 1895, authorizes the printing of 
10,000 copies of the Smithsonian Eeport (of which Part ii is the vol- 
ume devoted to the operations of the National Museum), 1,000 of 
which shall be for the use of the Senate, 2,000 for the House of Repre- 
sentatives, OjOOO for distribution by the Smithsonian Institution, and 
2,000 for the ]S"ational Museum. The quota allotted to the Museum is 
quite insufficient to supply even the large public and scientific libraries 
throughout the world, not to mention the various departmental and 
bureau libraries of the Government, consular officers, collaborators, 
and contributors to the collections in the Museum, and the numerous 
applications from individuals and institutions not on the mailing lists. 
The Smithsonian Institution has, however, kindly ];)laced at the dis- 
posal of the Museum a iwrtion of its allotment, thus making i^ossible a 
more satisfactory distribution than could otherwise have been effected. 

Requisitions for printing Volume xvii of Proceedings and Bulletin 
48 have been sent to the Printing Office. 

The Museum Report for 1892, constituting Part ii of the Report of 
the Smithsonian Institution, was pnblished during the year. The sepa- 
rate papers in the appendix to the Rejiort were issued in pamphlet form 
before the close of the last year. The volume for 1893 is now going 
through the press, and its receipt from the printer at an early date is 
expected. The separate papers (Nos. 97(3-1032) in Volume xvii of 
Proceedings have, with one exception, been distributed. Tlie bound 
volume Avill soon be ready for distribution. Advance sheets of a paper 
by M. L. Linell, describing a new species of Golden Beetle from Costa 
Rica, and a note on two new species of beetles of the Tenebrionid genus 
Echocerns^ by F. H. Chittenden, were published, in order to secure pri- 
ority of description to the authors. The papers will be reprinted as 
Nos. 1010 and 1011 in Volume xviii of tlie Proceedings. The titles of

all papers distributed in separate form during tlie year will be touud in 
Api)eiidi\ V. ^laiiuscripts ot-'i") papers to be included in \'olunie xviii 
liave been lorwarded to the Priutinj^' Office. These include 14 papers 
relating to fishes, relating to birds, 4 relating to niollusks, and 8 papers 
on other subjects. 

Bulletin Xo. 48, "Contribution toward a MonogTai)h of the Insects 
of the Lepidopterous Family Noctuidse of Boreal North America; 
A Eevision of the Deltoid Moths," by John B. Smith, has been pub- 
lished. The following additional parts of Bulletin Xo. 39 are now in 
the folding room : Part H, " Directions for collecting minerals," by Wirt 
Tassin ; Part F, 'M)irectious for collecting rocks and for the preparation 
of thin sections," by (leorge P. Merrill; Part J, "Directions for col- 
lecting specimens and information illustrating the aboriginal uses of 
plants," by Frederick V. Coville; Part K, "Directions for collecting 
and preparing fossils," by Charles Schuchert. An extra edition of 
Part A, " Directions for collecting birds," by llobert Ridgway, has 
been i)rinted at the exj)ense of the Museum allotment, to supply the 
extraordinary demand for this pamphlet. Considerable progress has 
been made with Bulletin 47, "The Fishes of North and Middle Amer- 
ica," by David Starr Jordan and Barton VV. Evermann, and the volume 
will doubtless be ready for distribution during the next fiscal year. 
The manuscript for the second volume of the work is now in prei>ara- 
tion. The bulletin will be accompanied by an atlas of i^lates. 

The second of the series of Special Bulletins in quarto form, entitled 
"Oceanic Ichthyology," relating to the deep-sea and pelagic fishes of 
the world, by G. Brown Goode and Tarleton II. Beau, the pre]>aration 
of which was noticed in the Report for last year, has been set in type, 
and will shortly go to press. The preparation of the third of the series 
of Special Bulletins, being the second volume of " Life Histories of 
North American Birds," by Charles E. Bendire, has rai»idly progressed, 
and the bulletin is already i)artially in type. This, as well as the 
preceding, will also be published in the Smithsonian Contributions to 
Knowledge. 

Four circulars have been issued by the Museum during the year, 
Nos. 43 to 45, requesting the transmission of publications of scientific 
bodies and educational establishments to the Museum library and 
inviting the contribution of authors' separates and reprints, and No. 
46, soliciting the cooperation of students and collectors in forwarding 
plants found in the District of Columbia, and notes concerning them, 
for incorporation in a proposed revised edition of Bulletin 22, by Lester 
F. Ward, entitled "A Guide to the Flora of Washington and Vicinity,'' 
which a]>peared in 1881. 

MATERIAL LENT FOR INVESTIGATION. 

As in previous years, a considerable quantity of material has been 
sent to specialists for examination and study. Some of the more im- 
portant transactions of this character are here mentioned. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39 

A number of specimens of small mammals were transmitted to Dr. 
Edgar A. Moarns, U. S. A., Fort Myer, Ya. A portion of tbis material

42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

WOEK OF STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS AT THE MUSEUM. 

A iiiiuiber of persous have availed themselves of the privilege of 
examining Museum material in the offices and laboratories of the cura- 
tors. These include students, specialists from various parts of the 
country who had come to Washington for the purpose of consulting the 
collections, and officers of several of the scientific bureaus of the Gov- 
erninent. 

])r, Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. A., spent considerable time in the dei)art- 
nient of mammals studying the large collection from the Mexican 
boundary which he had been foremost in gathering in connection with 
his work on the survey. Many specimens Mere also sent to him at Fort 
INIyer, Va., for examination and comi)arison. He has in view the pub- 
lication of an extensive report on the geographical distribution and 
relationships of the various forms inhabiting the southern border of 
the United States. The officers of the Division of Ornithology and 
Mammalogy of the Department of Agriculture have had free access to 
the mammal collections. 

Mr. J. M. Stowell, of the Lelaud Stanford Junior University, visited 
the Museum during the summer of 1894, for the purpose of studying 
the methods of taxidermy employed here. 

The committee on classification and nomenclature of the American 
Ornithologists' Union held its sessions in the office of the curator of the 
department of birds, and made daily use of the study series, thereby 
deciding numerous questions of importance in connection with the 
Union's "Check List of JSTorth A merican Birds." Mr. Charles B. Cory, of 
Boston, Mass., consulted the collections in connection with the identifi- 
cation of species of Ehdnea from San Domingo. Mr. William Brewster 
brought to the Museum a number of specimens of North American and 
Mexican birds, whose correct determination necessitated a comparison 
with types and other specimens in the Museum. Dr. A. K. Fisher, of 
the Department of Agriculture, examined specimens on various occa- 
sions, mainly in connection with his work at the Department, Maj. 
Charles E. Bendire, honorary curator of the department of oology in 
the Museum, frequently consulted the collections of birds in connection 
witli the identification of s[)ecimcus, and also to aid him iu flxng the 
geographical range of species included in the second volume of his -' Life 
Histories of North American Birds." Mr. Henry C. Oberholser, of the 
Department of Agriculture, has almost daily consulted the study series 
iu connection Mith special investigations which he is conducting, and 
also with a view to obtaining a more detailed knowledge of the North 
American species and subspecies of birds. Mr. R. P. Currie has made 
similar use of the collections. Mr. E. E. xVrmstrong did considerable 
volunteer work in the de])artment of birds, at the same time improving 
the opportunity to study the collections. 

Dr. C Baur, of the University of Chicago, who was engaged for a time

in the study of the Testndiiiata, and Prof. B. 1). Cope, of Phihulelpbia, 
were given facilities for study in the laboratory of the department of 
reptiles, in connection with the i)reparatiou of his forthcoming- work on 
"The Snakes and Lizards of North America," which will be published 
as a bulletin of the IMuseum, 

Prof. C. W. Johnson, of the Wagner Free Institute of Science, Phila- 
delphia, visited the Museum several times to consult the collection of 
Stratyomyidw, and Prof. Lawrence Brnner, of Lincoln, Nebr., con- 
sulted the collections of Lepidoptera and Hynienoptera for the pur- 
pose of identifying western species. Mr. Ellison A. Smith, professor 
of biology at the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, Blacks- 
burg, Va., consulted the collection in connection with the identification 
of exotic butterflies, and Prof. J. B. Smith, of New Brunswick, N. J., 
visited the Museum for the purpose of examining material in connec- 
tion with his monographic work on the Noctuids. Mr. 0. H. Roberts 
and Mr. Aug. Merkel, of New York City, and C^apt. Henry John Elwes, 
president of the P]ntomological Society of London, also consulted the 
collections in the department of insects. 

During the present year, as heretofore. Dr. Theodore Gill made use 
of the collections of fishes in connection with liis studies of families 
and genera. Mr. Barton W, Evermann comjiared specimens in the 
collection with material obtained by field parties of the U. S. Fish Com- 
mission. 

During the summer of 1894, Prof. C. C. Nutting, of the State Uni- 
versity of Iowa, spent several weeks in the laboratory of the department 
of marine invertebrates studying the large collection of Hydroids, espe- 
cially the West Indian forms. Dr. R. P. Bigelow si)ent a few days at 
the Museum in revising his report on the Stomatopoda. Prof. A. E. 
Verrill has continued his studies at New Haven of the Fish Commission 
material from the Atlantic coast north of Cape Hatteras, and especially 
of tlie echinoderms. 

Dr. Albert Hassall, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department 
of Agriculture, has made use of the Museum collections in connection 
with his studies of scientific and economic helminthology. 

In the department of mollusks, Prof. William B. Clark, of Johns Hop- 
kins University, studied the Tertiary fauna of ]\Liryland; Mr. Charles 
W. Johnson, of the Wagner Free Institute of Science, Philadelphia, 
studied the Tertiary fanna of North Carolina, and Mr. T. Wayland 
Vaughan, of the U. S. Geological Survey, spent some time in the study 
and examination of the Eocene corals. 

During the year Mr. J. D. McGuire, of Ellicott City, Md., continued 
his studies of the art of stone working. Mr. Stewart Culin, of the 
University of Pennsylvania, spent considerable time in the department 
of ethnology in the study of games and gambling devices, with a view 
to comparing them witli the series in the Museum of Archipology and 
Paleontology at the university. Dr. Franz Boas i>rosecuted an extended

study of tlie ethnology of the ludiaus of the Northwest Coast, speud- 
iug a great deal of time in arranging and labeling specimens. The 
results of this study and of his visit to the Northwest Coast in 1895 are 
embodied in a paper on the " Social Organization and the Secret Societies' 
of tlie Kwakiutl Indians," published in this volume. Dr. W. J. Hofl'man, 
of the IJureau of Ethnology, was also engaged for a considerable time 
in the prosecution of investigations in the department of ethnology. A 
paper by him on ''The Graphic Arts of the Eskimo" api)ears in Part ii 
of this volume. 

Prof. J. M. Coulter, of Lake Forest University, spent about ten days 
in the herbarium during February and March in the study of Mexican 
Umbellifera'. I)r. B. L. llobinson was occui^ied about a week in the 
study of the lianuuculacejiB and neighboring families. Prof. Edward 
L. Greene, of Berkeley, Cal., spent several days in making critical 
observations of Western species. Dr. Marcus E. Jones, of Salt Lake 
City, determined a large collection of plants, giving about four or five 
months to the work. Mr. John B. Leiberg, of Hope, Idaho, was in 
Washington for several weeks studying the plants of eastern Oregon; 
and Mr. P. A. Kydberg, of Lincoln, Nebr,, spent two months in the 
completion of a report on a collection of plants which he obtained in 
the Black Hills in 1S92.

MATERIAL RECEIVED FOR EXAMINATION AND REPORT. 

It has always been the policy of the Miiseiiiu to examine, free of 
charge, specimens transmitted to the Museum for determination, no 
matter by whom or from what locality. This privilege has been 
appreciated, as is shown by the large number of packages arriving daily 
with requests for identification. In this way the special knowledge of 
the curators is freely placed at the disposal of anyone who chooses 
to seek it. Since the Museum building was opened in 1881, not less 
than 0,000 persons have taken advantage of this privilege, and not a 
day passes without receiving similar requests. In the case of geolog- 
ical material, qualitative determinations only can be made, as the 
Museum has not facilities for making extended chemical analyses for 
the public. Its small and insufldcieutly equipped laboratory is barely 
sufficient for the analytical work which is absolutely necessary in con- 
nection with the current operations of the geological departments. 

In addition to requests under this head, numerous requests for tech- 
nical information, unaccompanied by specimens for determination, are 
constantly received, and these two classes of requests alone necessitate 
a large amount of correspondence. 

During the year material from all parts of the United States, as well 
as from British America, West Indies, Mexico, Central America, South 
America, several countries in Europe, and from Asia and Oceanica, 
was transmitted to the Museum for examination and report. It is very 
seldom that any of this material is desired for the collections, and expe- 
rience has proved that material of a character likely to be wanted, is 
usually transmitted with a request for its return. When any of these 



46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

sendiugs are letaiued. their addition to the i^ermaneiit collections is 
recorded by means of a double number, as may be seen in Appendix 
VI. The first number is that whicli is given to the material on the 
"examination and report " record ; the latter, the number on the per- 
manent accession record. During the year 407 lots (Nos. 1*709-3235, 
inclusive) have been received, lleports prepared by the curators or 
their assistants have been forwarded to the senders. 

A detailed list, arranged alphabetically by names, is given in Ap- 
pendix VI. 

MEETINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS IN WASHINGTON DTTRIN(f THE YEAR. 

The American Historical Association held its tenth annual meeting in 
Washington on December 20-28, 1804. The lecture hall of tlic 3Iuseum 
was used for the morning sessions.' 

On January 3, 1895, the National Science ( 'lub held a meeting in the 
lecture hall.' 

The regular April meeting of the I^ational Academy of Sciences 
was, as usual, held in the Museum building. The lecture hall was 
used for the public meetings and one of the offices for the business 
meetings. The titles of the papers entered to be read at this meeting 
are given in Ai)pendix vii. 

On February 25, 1888, a joint commission of the Anthropological, 
Biological, Chemical, Geographic, and Philosophical societies was 
formed, the Entomological and Geological societies being admitted a 
short time afterwards. The necessity for more complete cooperation 
among these societies had been manifest for some time, and many 
of the i)rominent members used their influence to bring about such 
a result. It was felt that one feature of the work, especially, could 
be carried on to greater advantage — that of providing for suitable 
courses of popular lectures. Accordingly, on January 25, 1895, the 
following constitution was drafted, and afterwards adopted by the sev- 
eral societies: 

I. The joint commission shall be composed of the officers and adnuuistrative 
boards of the several component societies. 

II. The commission shall have power (a) to provide for meetings of the societies; 
(h) to conduct courses of popular lectures; (c) to prepare a joint directory of the 
members of the societies; (d) to distribute to all members of the societies periodic 
advance notices of the meetings of the several societies; (e) to act in the interest of 
the component societies at the instance of any of them. 

III. The expense thus incurred shall be borne by the several societies in the ratio 
of their membership. 

The joint commission was organized on February 20 with Mr. 
Gardiner G. Hubbard as president and Dr. G. Brown Goode as vice- 
president.

COTTON STATES AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION AT ATLANTA, GA. 

By the act of Congress, approved August 8, 1894, provision was made 
for a Government exhibit at the Cotton States and International Expo- 
sition to be held at Atlanta from September 18 to December 31, 1895. 
The sum of $150,000 was appropriated, with the addition of $50,000 for 
the erection of a building. Dr. Charles W. Dabney, jr., was made chair- 
man of the Government board of management. The sum of $22,000 
was allotted to the Smithsonian Institution and. the National Museum, 
of which $10,500 is available for the preparation of exhibits. At the 
close of the fiscal year this work was well under Avay, exhibits being 
in course of preparation in the following departments : Mammals, birds, 
marine invertebrates, comparative anatomy, reptiles, fishes, mollusks, 
insects, paleontology, minerals, geology, botany, ethnology, and pre- 
historic anthropology. The technological collections were also repre- 
sented, as well as the sections of materia medica, oriental antiquities 
and religious ceremonials. 

An extended account of the participation of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion in this Exposition, including a descrii)tion of the exhibits to be pre- 
pared by the National Museum, will be published in the Eeport of the 
Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890. Not only the 
Museum, but all the other dependencies of the Institution, will prepare 
exhibits, viz, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Bureau of Inter- 
national Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro- 



48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

pLysical Observatory. Tbe esliibit being prepared by the Bureau of 
Etlinology will include a number of life-size models of Papago and 
Seri Indians, together with a series of weapons, household utensils, 
and articles of personal adornment used by these tribes. A collection 
of similar articles used by the Cherokees will also be shown. The 
Bureau of International Exchanges will send one of the fifty sets of 
Government documents which are annually transmitted by tbe Bureau 
to institutions abroad, and will exhibit a map showing the geograph- 
ical distribution of the correspondents of the Institution. The Zoolog- 
ical Park will be represented by a series of views of various objects of 
interest within its borders, and the Astrophysical Observatory will 
send a number of photographs of the special apparatus employed in 
connection with the investigations which are being conducted in that 
establishment. The Institution proper will exhibit, among other things, 
a complete set of its publications, comprising about two hundred 
volumes. 



III.— REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC 
DEPARTMENTS. 

The statements wliicli appear under this heading are for the most 
part gathered from the annual reports of the curators. Commencing 
with the year 1893, these have been submitted in the form of answers to 
a series of questions. This form of report has, after much considera- 
tion, been adopted, for the present at any rate, as preferable to the 
former plan, the chief objection to which was that the information sui)- 
l^lied in the reports did not always present a complete and homoge- 
neous statement of the work accomplished. This made it dififlcult to 
comprehend at a glance how much work had been accomplished in any 
special direction, and often resulted in the introduction of a large 
amount of material into the volume which did not have a direct bear- 
ing on the work of the curator as custodian of a collection, and, there- 
fore, although perfectly admissible in an extended essay, with the 
work of the department as its basis, was not, at times, altogether 
within the scope of an administrative document. 

In reviewing the work of the scientific departments in the Museum 
during the year which ended on June 30, 1895, the fact must be remem- 
bered that considerable time and labor have been necessarily expended 
in the preparation of exhibits for the Atlanta Exposition, which opens 
on September 18. Exhibits for this occasion are being prepared by 
every department in the Museum, and a statement of what has been 
done in this direction by each department will be presented in the 
report for 1896, that being the fiscal year in which the Exposition is to 
be held. An account of these exhibits, it may be added, is now being 
prepared in the form of a pamphlet, to be distributed at Atlanta during 
the continuance of the Exposition. 

Experience has proved that the regular work of the Museum always 
sufters to a very considerable extent during the years when expositions 
in which the Museum is directed to participate, are held. Nor can it 
be otherwise, since the features which it is especially desirable to 
emphasize in special exhibits of this kind are not, as a rule, such as 
would ordinarily be made conspicuous in the natural development of 
the Museum exhibition series. Again, it is noticeable that in exposi- 
tion years the number of papers published by the curators, as the result 
of their studies of the c )llections under their care, is much smaller 
than in other years. This is readily accounted for by the fact that the 

49 

NAT MUS 95 4 



50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

iinie which wouUl otherwise be given to study is oonsumed iu the spe- 
cial work of the exposition, and nnfortunately the outcome of this work 
does not as a rule redound to the full benefit of tlie Museum after the 
exposition is over. This subject has been already dwelt upon in previous- 
reports, and while the Museum is always ready to make every effort 
to provide a creditable display at expositions, it can not be said that, 
taking everything into consideration, the Museum is much the gainer. 
It is true that special appropriations are generally made to enable the 
Museum to participate, but these are so inadequate that not only is the 
result usually unsatisfactory to the Museum authorities, but also the 
specimens purcliased are not always such as can be assimilated with 
the permanent Museum exhibits after their return to Washington. 

Notwithstanding these obstacles, very excellent headway has been 
made in strictly Museum work in many of the departments, as will be 
seen in the following account of what has been accomplished. 

DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 

By far the most important collection received during the year was 
that sent iu by Dr. W. L. Abbott, who has collected during the year in 
Eastern Turkestan, on the border of the Pamir, and in Kashmir. He 
presented a collection of 107 specimens, including several fine speci- 
mens of Himalayan ibex, Polo's sheep, Asiatic gazelle, stag, etc., 
together with good series of marmots, pikas, mice, and other small 
forms. Mr, William Astor Ohanler presented the type of Ohanler's 
lieed Buck ( Gerricapra ChanJcri). From Mr. H. C. Moore were received 
40 mammals from South Africa, including several antelopes. This col- 
lection will serve an excellent purpose iu filling existing vacancies in the 
exhibition series. A collection of West African species, though mostly 
in the form of pelts, was received from Mr. J. H. Camp. It included 
two specimens of the very rare Golden Mole (Chrysochloris leucorhina). 

The collection has received numerous additions from the National 
Zoological Park, in accordance with the general understanding that 
animals dying in confinement shall be turned over to the National 
Museum, the skins and skulls coming to this department and the 
skeletons being transferred to the department of comparative anatomy. 
Several interesting animals, obtained by the Fish Commission, were 
also added to the collection. From the G-overnment exhibits of Costa 
Kica, Ceylon, Korea, and Johore at the World's Columbian Exposition, 
specimens of mammals were acquired at the close of the Exposition, 
although they were not recorded on the catalogue of the department 
until during the fiscal year covered by this report. The number of 
individuals contributing material to this department during the year 
was 56. The collections of Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, made during his con- 
nection with the Mexican Boundary Commission, included 708 specimens 
of mamnuils. This gift contained material of much scientific value, the 
specimens having been prepared and labeled with the greatest care. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 51 

The fact tbat bis collections represented the results of coutiuuous 
exploration along a line of several hundreds of miles, also adds con- 
siderably to their value. 

The rearrangement of the exhibition series of mammals during the 
year occupied the attention of the curator, Mr. F. W. True, for several 
weeks. He thus describes the details incident to this work: 

In the fall of 1894 a complete rearraugement of the cases iu the exhibition hail 
was effected, agreeahly with iustrnctious from the Assistant Secretary. The position 
of all the movable cases was changed, with th<> object of making a better balanced 
arrangement and one more attractive, also to break up the continuous vista pre- 
viously maintained in the center of the hall. It was found necessary thereafter to 
raise the large cast of a humpback whale, which was done. The series of inter- 
locked antlers was transferred to the osteological hall. Several groups fur which no 
place could be found were packed and stored. Large labels were made for the series 
of porpoise casts arranged on top of the wall cases. The Audubon lithographic 
pictures of mammals which were purchased and framed by the Museum some time 
ago, were hung in the office of the curator until a more suitable place could be found 
for them. The cetacean molds were all overhauled and a detailed list made of them 
for reference. The taxidermists mounted eight skins, but on account of being called 
upon for other work nothing Avas completed. A large amount of work was done 
upon the alcoholic study series in the way of cataloguing, arranging, rebottliug, 
etc. The Mearus collection was gone over, a concordance of collector's and Museum 
numbers made, and other necessary work performed. All new accessions were cata- 
logued and put in cases. A large number of skins from the taxidermists' vats were 
labeled and put in their jjroper places. 

The work of the taxidermist is referred to more in detail elsewhere. 

The present condition of the collections, so far as the preservation 
of the material contained in them is concerned, is better than at any 
previous time, as is shown in the following extract from Mr. True's 
report : 

The exhibition series is in good condition, but the space and cases in which to 
exhibit it are entirely inadequate. This applies especially' to the large mammals. 
The wall cases are so full that only the heads and necks of the deer, antelope, etc., 
can be seen. The floor cases are so much crowded that light is obstructed, and the 
attractiveness of the collection is much diminished. There are numerous antelopes, 
deer, seals, etc., in the taxidermists' vats, which, when mounted, can be exhibited 
only with much difficulty and under unfavorable conditions. 

As regards the study series, more storage cases are needed foi- the large skins. 
The alcoholics will need a great deal more labor spent upon them. 

As pointed out last year, the large skulls of horned mammals are in need of better 
installation. A plan was submitted for that purpose, but was not acted upon. The 
great series of small skulls, as stated last year, is in a very unsatisfactory condition 
as regards installation. Some 1,500 boxes were purchased for these skulls during the 
year, but it was not possible to get the skulls transferred into them. 

The card catalogue of skins and alcoholics needs revision. This is an important 
matter, but can not be taken up and brought to a finish in the midst of constant 
interruption. An incomplete catalogue of this kind is of practically no value. 

Besides the necessary administrative work accomplished in connec- 
tion with the care of the incoming material and the installation of the 
specimens most suitable for exhibition, Mr. True lias made special stud- 
ies in certain directions. These have resulted iu the preparation of a 



52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

paper ou the occurreuce of armadillos of the ^enim Xenio-us in Central 
America. He has nearly completed a comprehensive paper ou the 
"Antlers of the Deer Family." This will be published as one of the 
accompanying- i)apers in the next Keport. Work has also been con- 
tinued on a monograph of the Americau moles, in connection with which 
the preparation of a series of osteolbgical drawings was found neces- 
sary. Mr. True has published four papers during the year — two in 
" Science''' and two in the " Proceedings of the National Museum." The 
titles are given in the Bibliography (Appendix iv). A new species was 
described in the paper on the "Eodents of the genus 8minthus in 
Kashmir," under the name of ^Sm^nfhns fants. 

In May, 1895, Mr. True was temporarily attached to the staff of the 
U. S. Fish Commission, at the request of the Acting Commissioner, for 
the purpose of making a special study of the seal rookeries. 

Owing to the limited appropriations made by Congress for the main- 
tenance of the Museum, very little can be done in the way of explorations 
under the direct auspices of the Museum. Assistance was rendered to 
Dr. Mearns in his work connected with the survey of the Mexican 
Boundary, by supplying him with collecting material. An expedition 
to Lake Okeechobee, Florida, by Mr. Kidgway and Mr. William Palmer, 
resulted in obtaining a small number of mammals, chietly forms not 
well represented in the collections. It is most fortunate for the Museum 
that the friendly and valuable assistance of Dr. W. L. Abbott, which 
has been so often manifested in his generous gifts, has been con- 
tinued this year. As already stated, a very important accession has 
recently been received from him as the result of his explorations in 
Turkestan and Kashmir. The expedition of Mr. William Astor Chanler 
and Lieutenant von Hohnel in the Tana Kiver region. East Africa, has 
yielded an important contribution to the Museum collection of mam- 
mals. Reference should also be made to the collections of Mr. J. D. 
Figgins in Maryland, and of Mr. J. II. Camp in the Congo region, 
West Africa. The thanks of the Museum are further due to Mr. 
Charles H. Townsend, naturalist of the Fish Commission, for his zeal 
in obtaining specimens for the Museum while engaged in collecting 
work under the auspices of the United States Fish Commission. 

In accordance with established usage, the Museum has lent its mate- 
rial freely to scientific investigators for study. In this connection may 
be mentioned several transmissions of specimens from this department 
to Dr. J. A. Allen and Mr. F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum 
of Natural History, New York; Dr. Harrison Allen, of Philadelphia; 
Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, for use in his studies of the Mexican Boundary 
collection; Mr. S. N. Ehoads, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural 
Scieiu'cs, and Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., of the Department of Agriculture. 
Opportunity to study the collection of mammals in the Museum build- 
ing has also been extended to Dr. ]\[earns and to the members of the 
staff in the division of economic ornithology and mammalogy in the 
Department of Agriculture. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 53 

In addition to tliose already mentioned as having made direct contri- 
butions to the collections, the Museum in general, and this department 
in particular, has benefited greatly through the friendly cooperation 
of Maj. Timothy E. Wilcox, V. S. A., Fort Huachuca, Ariz., Avho has sent 
in many interesting si)ecimens from time to time from the vicinity of 
his post; to Dr. Sheldon Jackson, of the Bureau of Education, who 
transmitted a skin of Spermophile, and to Prof. F. A. Ward, Kochester, 
K. Y., Prof. William Trelease, of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. 
Louis, and Dr. P. L. Sclater, London, England. The curator states 
that many of the ofticers and employees of the Museum have inter- 
ested themselves in obtaining specimens for the collection, no less than 
eighteen different persons having rendered such assistance during the 
year. 

Regarding the plans which the curator has in mind for improving 
the collection of mammals, he writes: 

What the Museum now needs moi^e thau anything else, in my opinion, is a better 
reiireseutation of exotic mammals. Of about 410 genera usually recognized, we 
liossess repre^sentatives of only 240, leaving 170 genera entirely unrepresented. 
Furthermore, many of the genera now in the collection are represented only by a 
single imperfect skin, or a single skeleton. (Of skulls I have taken no notice.) On 
very many occasions, in order to become acquainted with the character of a genus 
or species, I have been compelled to extract the skull (often imperfect) from the 
single siiecimen in the collection. 

The study of mammals has greatly increased of late, and the investigations are 
taking a wider range than ever before. In this work the need of specimens of 
ibreigu groups is strongly felt, as it is recognized that work upon American mate- 
rial alone is liable to lead to one-sided results. There is no full collection of foreign 
mammals in America, and at present our students must limit their researches, or go 
abroad to study. In my opinion, the national collection should endeavor to fill this 
need. 

The number of specimens added to the collection during the year 
was 1,484. In the catalogue of skins, skulls, and alcoholics 1,872 
entries were made, the last entry in June, 1894, having been 60,G07, 
and in June, 1895, 02,479. Skeletons are considered as anatomical 
specimens, and are entered in the catalogue of the department of com- 
parative anatomy. In the volume in which are entered the specimens 
belonging to the deposit of the Department of Agricnlture 6,402 entries 
have been made, the last entry in June, 1894, having been 65,818, and 
in June, 1895, 72,220. 

DEPAllTMENT OF BITIDS. 

The curator, Mr. Eobert llidgway, reports the number of accessions 
as somewhat in advance of those received in 1894, while the number 
of entries in the catalogue has been more than 1,100 in excess of that 
year. The scientific value of the accessions of this year is also reported 
as greater than of those received in 1894. The curator mentions the 
names of thirty establishments and individuals from whom important 
additions to the collections have been received. The list is headed with 



54 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

the name of Mr. A. Boucaid, Isle of Wight, Kuglaud, who presented 
1,060 speciiiiens. These represent a large number of families. Dr. W. 
L. Abbott, whose name occurs in connection with accessions in several 
of the departments, contributed 258 specimeus from Kashmir, Ladak, 
and Turkestan. Six accessions, including si)ecies obtained in Arizona, 
California, and Lower California, wore transmitted by Br. Edgar A. 
Mearns, TJ. S. A., and Mr. F. X. Holzuer, in connection with their 
work on the Mexican IJonndary Survey. In addition. Dr. Mearns also 
contributed .'UO specimeus, representing 100 species, from Fort Clark 
and Fort Hancock, Tex. The curator obtained 152 specimens from 
Florida, Maryland, and Illinois, and Mr. R. S. Matthews, of the National 
jNlnseum, presented 159 specimens of birds from the United States, 
Mexico, and Central America. Mr. Charles W. Richmond, assistant 
curator of this department, presented 115 specimens from Virginia, 
Mexico, Borneo, and other localities. Mr. William Palmer, chief tax- 
idermist of the Museum, presented S specimens of Hooded AVarbler 
from Virginia, and also collected 30 specimens from Florida. In addi 
tion to collections received from individuals, mention should be made 
of the contribution of 21 specimens from Alaska by the IT. S. Fish 
Commission, and of 41 specimens from South America, ac(]uired from 
the La Plata Museum, La Plata, Argentina, in exchange. 

A series of specimens has been selected with considerable care for a 
special exhibit of a popular character. This has l»een installed on the 
first floor of the south tower. In this series it is intended to include 
every species likely to be asked for by the casual visitor, or by anyone 
nmking an elementary study of ornithology. It is thought that it will 
be of especial interest to the pupils of the public schools. The exhibit 
consists of the following series: The more familiar European birds; the 
more familiar North American birds; remarkable l)irds of other parts 
of the world; a series illustrating and explaining the confusion of pop- 
ular names, examples of protective coloring, protective mimicry, etc., 
"Giants and Pygmies," or the largest and snuillest members of certain 
groups; a series of eggs, showing a gradual transition in size from the 
egg of the extinct JK})iornis to that of the smallest humming bird; albi- 
nos and other abnormal color varieties and malformations, and a series 
of flightless l)irds, together with those of extraordinary i)owers of 
flight, for comparison. A catalogue will probably be printed, which, by 
means of reference numbers and letters, corresj^onding to the number- 
ing on the shelves and cases, will enable the visitor to locate any speci- 
men witiiout ditflculty. In addition, a label will be provided for each 
specimen. It is also proposed to place in the alcove a reading table 
and a case containing a few selected works by well-known writers on 
ornithology. 

Valuable assistance in the preparation of this exhibit has been 
receive<l from ]\Irs. Olive Thorne Miller, of Brooklyn, N. Y. 

Tlie following paragraphs from the curator's report Avill serve to show 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 55 

Miiat progress has been made iu cariug for the collections, and also the 
present condition of the exhibition and study series: 

The collectious have been thoroughly iuspected at proper intervals, and fumi- 
gated with bisulphide of carbon to destroy any insects which niii-ht be present. No 
insects have been found, however, and, except in the exhibition cases, few of which 
are sufficiently tight to prevent the ingress of insects or to allow of effective fumi- 
gation, and in the old Salvin cases in the west basement, there is little danger to be 
apprehended in this direction. 

Some changes have heeu made m th<' mounted collection, as follows: A limited 
number of badly mounted specimens have been remounted, and other specimens too 
dilapidated for exhibiticm have been replaced by better ones. The taxidermist has 
been engaged for several months past in renovating the entire mounted collection, 
subjecting each specimen to a process of cleaning, which, it is hoped, will result in 
a material improvement in this part of the collection. 

A volunteer assistant, Mr. E. E. Armstrong, spent over two months iu the depart- 
ment of birds, in this time lining with sheet cotton the trays (about HoO iu number) 
contained in the 54 quarter-unit cases in the bird gallery, resulting in a great 
improvement to this part of the study series. 

The condition of the exhibition series is very good, and improvements and renova- 
tions are being made as time permits. The condition of tlie study series is excellent, 
as far as that portion of the collection accommodated in the bird gallery is con- 
cerned. The large birds, stored in the west basement, are in course of rearrange- 
ment (and have been for several years), this having been proceeded with until the 
cases of the new model provided for the ])urpose became exhausted. The work has 
since been continued on sporadically to accommodate temporarily the increase iu the 
collections. 

The work of Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist, is referred to more in 
the chai)ter relating to the work of the Museum jneparators. 

The curator has completed an elaborate treatise on the Galapagoan 
avifauna, and the pai)er has been submitted for publication. It consists 
of some 650 pages of manuscript, accompanied by outline maps illus- 
trating the range of all the species known to inhabit the archipelago, 
and two plates of outline figures illustrating generic and specific charac- 
ters. The text includes observations on the origin of the Galapagoan 
avifauna and other matters. It will doubtless prove to be a Avork of 
great value, and is, m the words of the curator, "in some respects the 
most imi)ortant work that the author has written." 

The avifauna of the island satellites of Madagascar, from the Comoro 
group to the Mascarenes, has been somewhat similarly worked up, 
though in less detail. The paper embodying the results of this work 
is based primarily on Dr. Abbott's collectious from Aldabra, Assump- 
tion, Gloriosa, and the Seychelle Islands, but is not quite finished. 
Progress has also been made on a comprehensive treatise on the birds 
of North and 3Iiddle America. This is a work of great magnitude and 
importance, and will constitute a valuable addition to the ornithological 
literature of the Museum. 

The gallery in the Smithsonian building, used by the department of 
birds for office iiurposes, is in many ways unsuited to work requiring 
close application. There being no room in either building available for 
the use of the curator, he has found it necessary to do a large part of 



56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

his literary work at home. lu view of the diflQculties encouutered, he 
is entitled to great credit for the work which he has been able to 
accomplish in addition to the routine duties of the department. 

The explorations of Dr. W. L. Abbott in Kashmir, Ladak, and Turk- 
estan, have, as already intimated, redounded in a large degree to the 
benefit of this department. The collecting work accomplished by Dr. 
Edgar A. Mearns and Mr. F. X. Holzner, of the Mexican Boundary 
Survey, by Mr. Ridgway in Maryland and Florida, and by Mr. William 
Palmer in Florida, has resulted in the acquisition of many interesting 
specimens. 

Several ornithologists have used material belonging to the depart- 
ment in connection with their special studies. In some instances the 
material was transmitted to their homes, while in others it was studied 
in the gallery of the department. The curator gives the names of tliirty 
persons through whose cooperation the collections have been enriched 
during the year. 

It is gratifying to remark that the material in this department has 
served as a basis for 26 papers published during the year by the 
curator, Mr. C. W. Richmond, the assistant curator, and several col- 
laborators of the Museum. These are all included in the Bibliography 
(Appendix iv). 

The total number of specimens received during the year was 5,499- 

The entries in the catalogue books aggregate 5,499, as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS' EGGS. 

Maj. Charles Bendire, honorary curator, rex)orts that 2,023 eggs and 
nests were added to the collection during the year. Their value is pro- 
portionately as great as that of the accessions in the previous year, 
although far less in number. Several new species and subspecies were 
included. Nearly all the accessions to this collection were given to the 
Museum, and the records contain the names of 30 donors wlio have thus 
rendered assistance. Only four specimens were acquired by purchase 

The most important contributions were made, as in several previous 
years, by Dr. William M. Ralph, of Utica, N. Y., whose generosity has 
elicited the warmest gratitude of the Museum authorities. His con- 
tributions this year consisted of 346 sets, including 1,224 eggs (repre 
senting 159 species), and 50 nests. This accession contains many rare 
and valuable specimens, besides adding nine species and subspecies to 
the collection. Among other contributors of valuable accessions were 
Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, Pa., who forwarded 38 specimens, 
representing 11 species; and Mr. Chase Littlejohn, Redwood City, Cal., 
who x>i"esented 20 specimens, representing three species. Collections 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57 

were also received from the U. S. Fish Commission aud the Department 
of Agricultare. 

This collection, including both the exhibition aud study series, is in 
excellent conditiou, every accession being carefully catalogued, labeled, 
and disposed of as soou as it is received. 

The curator has devoted most of his time, when not engaged in work 
on the accessions, to the preparation of the second volume of "Life His- 
tories of North American Birds," which is now in the hands of the 
printer. 

The last catalogue entry made in June, 1894, was 27088 and in June, 
1895, 27655. 

DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS. 

The material added to the collections during recent years has been of 
special value from a scientific standpoint, and the past year has been 
no exception. The number of specimens received in 1895 shows a slight 
increase over the records of previous years, Nearly 1,100 specimens 
were added to the collection, the largest number heretofore received in 
any one year being 1,055. This was the total for the year ending 
June 30, 1892, when the material from the Death Valley Expedition 
was received. By far the most important collection was that sent in 
by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. A., of the luternational Boundary Com- 
mission, which was found upon examination to contain a number of 
new species. Dr. A. K. Fisher, of the Department of Agriculture, made 
collections in the vicinity of the Mexican boundary, and material of 
considerable value was received from him during the year. A small 
but interesting collection of reptiles from the Jombene Range, East 
Africa, was received from Mr. William Astor Chanler. Several val- 
uable collections were transmitted by the U. S. Fish Commission, 
including material obtained by Messrs. Evermann aud Hirsch from 
the Maumee Basin, and by Mr. C. IT. Townsend from the Galapagos 
Islands. Dr. William L. Abbott presented material from Turkestan, 
and Prof. John Macoun, of Ottawa, sent a collection of Garter snakes 
from Canada. A specimen of AmbJijostoma annulatum, of which only 
one example had previously been taken, was purchased from Messrs. 
H. H. and C. S. Brimley, of Raleigh, N. C. A few specimens of rare 
New Mexican snakes were also purchased. 

In addition to those whose names have already been mentioned, 
reference should be made to the contributions of Prof. T. D. A. Cock- 
erell, of Las Cruces, N. Mex., who transmitted a number of specimens 
of reptiles; Mr. Hubert Brown, of Tucson, Ariz., who sent in several 
specimens of lizards; Mr. Henry G. Hubbard, of Washington, D. C, 
who collected specimens of Rana cvsoptis in Florida; Mr. H. Candlin,of 
Kerrville, Tex., who sent specimens of snakes from that region, and 
Dr. O. Boettger, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Germany, who transmitted in 



58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

exchange two specimens of Chinese lizards, desired for purposes of 
coinj^arison. 

During the fall of 1894 the curator made a trip to the Bad Lands of 
South Dakota, where he obtained a number of interesting specimens. 
^Ir. WilUam Palmer, of the National Museum, also made collections 
during his visit to Florida, in the spring of 1895. 

Ex])eriments have been made with formalin as a ])reservative, with a 
view to using it as a substitute for alcohol, but, while it has been found 
to possess advantages over the latter for use in the held, it is doubtful 
whether it will ever take the place of alcohol in the preservation of 
permanent museum collections. 

During the year the entire collection was overhauled, and the alcohol 
renewed. The exotic species in the study series have been rearranged. 
Owing to lack of space, no attempt has been made to increase the 
exhibition series. 

xVs mentioned elsewhere in this report, material has been lent to 
si)ecialists for study on several occasions during the year, and to Prof. 
E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia, were given special facilities for study iu 
the laboratory of the de]»artment. 

Dr. Stejneger has commenced the ])rei)aratioii of reports upon the 
reptiles of the Mexican Boundary, and upon the collections made by 
Dr. Fisher iu the Iluachuca Mountains. He has also continued work on 
his proposed manual of Japanese Herpetology. Several papers based 
upon Museum material have been published by the curator during the 
year, two of them containing descriptions of new species. All of the 
papers are referred to in the Bibliography (Api>endix iv). 

The last entry in the catalogue for the fiscal year covered by this 
report was 22,482, the last entry for the i)receding year having been 
21,388, a total of 1,094 entries. 

DEPARTMENT OF FISHES. 

Dr. Tarleton H. Beau still remains honorary curator of tliis depart- 
ment, although since his change of residence to New York Mr. Barton 
A. Bean, assistant curator, has practically performed the duties of 
curator. In his report he states that, although the accessions of the 
year were not so numerous or important as in 1894, much valuable 
material has been received. The most important accessions were a 
collection of tishes made at Mazatlau by Dr. ])avid S. Jordan and 
others, and presented by the Leland Stanford Junior University; a 
collection of fishes made at the Azores by Prof. William Trelease, 
director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis; a series of deep 
water tishes from the Indian Museum, Calcutta, collected by H. M. S. 
Invi-stUjutor in the Bay of Bengal. The U. S. Fish Commission trans- 
ferred to the Museum types of fourteen new species of fishes collected 
in Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, Iowa, and Lake Ontario; also collections 
of fishes from Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and the Columbia Eiver 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59 

IJasin. Ill all, upward of 0,000 specimens wew added to the collec- 
tion during- the year. 

Old and recent collections of Japanese and Chinese fishes, not in- 
stalled with the general collections, as well as collections made hy the 
Albatross and from other sources, in the West Indies and around the 
coasts of Florida, have been given a temporary place in the basement 
storage rooms. Duplicates from the deep sea collections have been 
l^rovided with metal tags and numbered, the species being separated 
in jars systematically arranged. Several large collections have been 
catalogued, including some resulting from the dredgings of the Alba- 
tross in the Pacific Ocean, and received during the previous year. 
Perhaps the most important work has been the vselection and arrange- 
ment of the deep sea material with a view to the preparation of the 
duplicates into sets for distribution to educational establishments. By 
this process of elimination the study series is now in a much more sat- 
isfactory condition. This series has also been improved by the acces- 
sion of new and well preserved material, including a number of types 
of new and rare forms. 

No special change has been effected in the exhibition series, which 
consists of five cases of casts of fishes, exhibited in the west hall of 
the Smithsonian building, and a large number of casts placed on the 
tops of cases containing corals, besides two cases of alcoholic speci- 
mens preserved in rectangular jars. 

Mr. Bean has i^repared a list of the European fishes in the collec- 
tions, and a list of the types of fishes i^reserved in the collections is 
now receiving his attention. Dr. Theodore Gill has examined a num- 
ber of Enropean fishes. Work upon the deep-sea fishes has been con- 
tinued by the Assistant Secretary and Dr. Bean, in connection with the 
preparation of Special Bulletin No. 2, "Oceanic Ichthyology." The 
assistant curator and Mr. B. W. Evermaun, of the U. S. Fish Commis- 
sion, have in preparation a bibliographical list of the fishes recorded 
from the fresh waters of North America north of the United States. 

Accessions of fishes resulted from the work of field parties of the 
Department of Agriculture in the Death Valley and in Mexico, the 
United States and Mexican Boundary Survey in California, and the ex- 
plorations of Messrs. Scovell and Woolman in Mexico in 1801. In addi- 
tion, collections were made in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence 
River during July and August, 1S94; also in Lake Champlain and in 
various streams of northeastern New York, by Messrs. Evermann, 
B. A. Bean, and others, under the auspices of the U. S. Fish Commission. 
These will be added to the Museum collections after examination. 

Material from this department has been lent to several specialists to 
aid them m their researches, and four collaborators of the Museum 
have studied the collections in the building. 

Twelve ])apers, based wholly or in part on the collections, have been 
published during the year. The authors were Dr. G. Brown Goode, 



60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Dr. T. II.Bean, Mr. Bartou A. Bean, Mr. Charles H. Beesou, Mr. Carl H. 
Eigeumauii, and Dr. Theodore Gill. Two new families, 11 new genera, 
and 9 new species were described in these papers. 

Upward of G,000 specimens were received during the year. The last 
catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 45451, and in June, 1895, 47504. 

DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING CENOZOIC FOSSILS). 

The year 1894-95 has undoubtedly been one of the foremost in the 
accomplishment of work in this department. During the absence of 
the curator, Dr. AVilliam II. Dall, m Alaska, Mr. Charles T. Simpson, 
assistant, assumed charge of the work. Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, who has 
labored so faithfully for many years in this department, still serves 
in an honorary capacity as associate curator, although he has left 
Washington to reside in Los Angeles, California. 

The number of accessions received during the year was 111, the same 
as in 1894. They are, for the most part, smaller in extent, although 
some of them are reported by Dr. Dall as being quite valuable. The 
most important contributions, as in many ]>revious years, were made 
by Eev. Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, to whom the warmest thanks of the 
Museum are due for so many valuable additions to tbe collections. 
Among his gifts to the Museum this year was a specimen of Fleuro- 
tomaria bei/richi, Hilg., from Japan. Series of land, fresh-water, and 
marine shells from the Philippine Islands were secured from Hamline 
University, through Prof. H. L. Osborn, in return for naming the large 
collection belonging to the university. In a similar way series of Ano- 
doutas and Unios from Canada and British America were obtained 
from the Geological Survey of Canada, through Prof. J. F. Whiteaves. 
This material is extremely valuable in furnishing evidence of geograph- 
ical distribution, on account of the accurate record of the localities from 
which it was derived. Dr. H. von Ihering also transmitted Uniouidie 
and other iTesh-water shells from Central and South America, in return 
for aid in naming his material. Mr. W. W. Herman presented several 
species of Japanese marine shells, in return for similar services. Mr. 
W. B. K. Johnson contributed laud and fresh- water shells from the Isle 
of Pines, Cuba. The Young Naturalists' Society, of Seattle, Wash., 
gave a series of Terehratula transversa and other shells from Puget 
Sound. The California Academy of Sciences, through Dr. J. G. Cooper, 
gave a collection of Lower Californian land shells, in return for identi- 
ficatioDs made for the Academy. An extensive lot of land shells and 
other material was collected and transmitted by Dr. Edgar A. Mearus, 
U. S. A., in connection with his work on the Mexican Boundary Survey. 
From the Museum of Natural History in Paris, Fravice, has been 
received, in exchange, a set of brachiopods obtained by the Travailleur 
at great depths in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The numerous accessions 
received from INIiss Ida M. Shepard and Mr. T. S. Oldroyd, in connection 
with their investigations of the fauna of Sau Pedro Bay, California, are

very valuable to the collectiou. The first installments of the mass of 
material which was collected by the U. S. Fish Commission and placed 
many years ago in the hands of Prof. A.E. Verrill, of Yale College, for 
study and identification, have been received. This fact is recorded 
with much pleasure and the acknowledgments of the Museum are due to 
Professor Verrill for the long and difticult task which the study of this 
material has imposed upon him. 

The curator thus reports on the work accomplished during the year 
in connection with the preservation and installation of the collections: 

Daring the year ending June 30, 1895, about 14,132 specimens, representing about 
3,000 species, have been entered upon our record book for the study collection. Most 
of these, together with a large amount previously entered, have been regularly incor- 
porated in the study series, the general index has been further added to and corrected, 
and lists of the species and genera for ready reference have been written and placed 
in each tray of the working collection. The entire general collection of Naiads has 
been carefully examined and compared with the Lea collectiou and literature and 
accurately named. They have been arranged in a natural system, in groups. At the 
present time Mr. Simpson is making out cards showing their distribution. 

A considerable part of the fine general marine collection presented by the Rev. Dr. 
L. T. Chamberlain has been administered upon, a part of this being added to the 
general collection and the remainder being jilaced among the duplicates. 

An extensive collection of alcoholic and dry material which was collected by the 
U. S. Fish Commission off the coast of New England has recently been received 
from Prof. A. E. Verrill, who has held the same for study and naming. The alco- 
holics have been carefully examined and the akohol made of preservative strength. 
The dry specimens are now being labeled by Miss Beard preparatory to being incoi"- 
porated in the study and duplicate series. During the year the shells of the family 
Mactrid;e have been carefully named and arranged by Dr. Dall in connection with 
his stiuly of the group. The tree snails of the Philippine Islands have been brought 
together, arranged essentially according to Pilsbry's " Manual of Conchology," and 
placed on exhibition. 

The present condition of the exhibition and study series, both of 
recent and Tertiary mollusks, is indicated by the curator in the following 
words : 

The general marine collection occupies the drawers of the cases running along the 
middle of the main hall; the collectiou from the west coast of North and South 
America and the general collection of land and fresh-water shells are in the south- 
eastern gallery; the Jeffreys collection and the collections from the West Indies and 
east coast of North America are in the curator's offices in the north tower; the Lea 
collection of Naiads is exhibited in the table cases in the eastern half of the main 
hall; the tree snails from the Philippine Islands are exhibited in two table cases in 
the western half of the main hall; the duplicates are stored in the basement; the 
alcoholi'c collection occupies the basement room, part of the northeastern galleiy, 
and two rooms in the north tower; the collection of Tertiary fossils is in the north- 
eastern gallery. 

Dr. Dall has partially completed his studies of the genus Cerion, nam- 
ing three new subgenera, founded on internal iamelhi?, and has finished 
his study and arrangement of the family Mactrid.c, and the classifi- 
cation of the Pelecypoda. The results have been published in the 
Proceedings of the National Museum and elsewhere. He has also 
continued his work on the Floridian Tertiary fauna.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



Mr. Charles T. iSiinpsou lias completed liis investigations of the land 
suailsof the West Indies, and has carried on through the year his studies 
of the Naiads of the Lea and general collections, resulting in a paper 
soon to appear in the Proceedings of the National Museum on the 
classification and geographical distribution of these forms. 

The collection has been enriched during the year by the results of the 
explorations of Prof. Alexander Agassiz on the yacht Wild I)ucl\ among 
the Bahamas. The Museum was presented with a series in return for 
tlie services of Dr. Dall in woildng up the collections. 

Explorations of the mollusk fauna of San Pedro Bay, California, have 
been carried on systematically by a group of couchologists, especially 
Miss Ida Shepard and Mr. T. S. Oldroyd, for some years. The doubtful 
forms have been worked out at the Museum, and a series of them, 
including many varieties, has been donated by the collectors. Explo- 
rations by the California Academy of Sciences in the Lower California 
Peninsula have resulted in collecting some fine and rare land shells, of 
which a series lias been donated to the Museum by the academy. 

Assistance has been extended to several couchologists by the loan 
of material from the collections for study in connection with special 
investigations. To three specialists have been accorded facilities for 
studying the collections of this department in the curator's laboratory. 
A list of these transactions will be found in another part of thelleport. 

The curator has determined a large amount of material, including 
1,701 species forwarded for examination and report by seventy students 
and institutions. He has also carried on an extensive correspondence 
in the way of supplying technical information in reply to special 
inquiries from conchological students in all parts of the world. 

The curator has published sixteen papers during the year, almost 
all of which have a direct bearing on the work of this department. 
Dr. R. E. C. Stearns i)ublished two papers in the "Nautilus." Five 
papers based on material belonging to the department were published 
by Mr. Simpson — four in the "Nautilus" and one in the Proceedings 
of the National Museum. 

In connection with the entry in the catalogue of material belonging 
to this department, several volumes are used for convenience, and the 
total number of entries in these books indicates the entire number 
made during the year.

REPORT OF ASSISTA^^T SECRETARY. 63 

DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 

The report of tbe lioiiorary curator, Prof. (^ V. Kiley, shows an increase 
in the number of accessions, there being 173 in ISO.") against lO.i in the 
preceding year. The most important gifts in 180.") were as follows: 
A collection of Odouata from Chinese Turkestan, presented by Dr. 
William L. Abbott, whose generosity to the Museum has been so 
frequently manifested in his gifts to this aud other departments both 
in this and in previous years: a collection of Lepidoptera from Guiana, 
presented by the IJritish Guiana ( 'ommission to the World's Columbian 
Exposition; a large collection of Lepidoptera from Jombeue Range, 
East Africa, presented by Mi-. William Astor Chanler and Lieutenant 
von H(ihnel; a collection of Japanese insects representing 1,500 species 
of all orders from the Imperial l^niversity, Tokyo, Japan; types of 35 
species of Koctuids from Prof. J. P. Smith, New Prunswick, N. J. Other 
valuable collections were acquired by exchange. 

Tlie biologic material of Coleoptera, including a large collection of 
European larva', obtained in past years by exchange with Schiodte aud 
Meynert in Coijenhagen, as well as by Professor Riley's own collectings 
and breedings, has been arranged in systematic order in two cabinets. 
A large part of the year was devoted to the study and proper arrange- 
ment of the exotic Coleoptera, This work was undertaken i)rimarily 
to facditate report upon the Japanese collection and the material 
obtained in East Africa by Dv. W. L. Abbott, Mr. William Astor Chan- 
ler, and Lieutenant von Hohnel. 

The urgent demand for space in other directions rendered it neces- 
sary to temporarily withdraw from exhibition the series illustrating 
systematic entomology. The study series are rei)orted to be in good 
condition. A large amount of material, especially in the orders Hyme- 
noptera and Coleoptera, remains unidentified, owing to i)ressure of work 
in other orders. 

During the year the curator commenced a com})rehensive study of 
the Termites of the world. The assistant, Mr. M. L. Linell, began a 
study of the Coleopterous fauna of the Galapagos Islands and its rela- 
tion to the continent. 

In ten instances material from this department was placed in the 
hands of specialists for study and identitication. Eight entomologists 
have taken advantage of facilities offered to study material in the 
curator's offices. 

The curator, his collaborators, and other specialists in entomology 
have published during the year 31 pa^jers based upon the Must-um 
collections. These are mentioned by titles under the names of the 
authors, in the Bibliography (Appendix iv). Twelve new genera and 
320 new species are described in these papers. This remarkably large 
number was due to the descriptions by Mr. W. H. Ashmead of new 
genera aud species from St. Vincent, forwarded by the West India

coinmittee for identification. Under this arrangement witli Mr. Asli- 
mead one set of types lias been deposited in tlie U. S. National 
Mnseum. 

The unmber of specimens received dnring tlie year is about 3,000. 
This does not include the Japanese collection of about 10,000 speci- 
mens, which was received during the previous year, but not taken up 
on the accession records until the year 1894-95. The last entry in the 
catalogue in June, 1894, was 1423, and in June, 1895, 1584. 

DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 

An important feature of work in this department has been the dis- 
tribution of duplicate collections of marine invertebrates. Forty-two 
sets have been disposed of in response to applications from educational 
establishments. Keference to these and all other distributions made 
during the year will l)e found in Appendix x. In only four of the 
other departments of the Museum— minerals, geology, fishes, and pre- 
historic anthropology — has any systematic work in separating the 
duplicates for this purpose been possible. From this department, in 
addition, twenty-one special collections were also sent out for Museum 
purposes and for study. The work of preparing these collections has 
devolved upon the assistant curators, Mr. James E. Benedict and Miss 
Mary J. Kathbun. The honorary curator, Mr. Richard Rathbun, has 
been able to devote only a very limited amount of time to Museum 
matters, being almost exclusively engaged in the work of the Fish 
Commission, to which he is officially attached. 

There was an increase of eleven accessions over the number received 
in the preceding year, and the scientific value of the accessions for 
this year far exceeded that of those acquired in the jirecediug year. 
The total number of specimens added to the collections in 1895 was 
2,378. The United States Fish Commission was the princi])al con- 
tributor, and from it were received four collections, comprising a large 
and valuable series of Ilolothurians and Foraminifera, resulting from 
the cruise of the Albatross to the Galapagos Islands in 1891, types of 
Calamocrinns diomedew Agassiz, and Brachyura and Anomura from 
the North Pacific Ocean, the latter group containing a fine series of 
Lithodida\ A collection of crustaceans and worms from the Azores 
was contributed by Prof. William Trelease, director of the Missouri 
Botanical Garden, !St. Louis, as a part of the result of his expedition. 
Dr, Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. A., transmitted an interesting series of 
invertebrates from near San Diego, Cal. This, and numerous other 
collections received from Dr. Mearns, was the result of an arrangement 
made between the War Department and the Smithsonian Institution 
in connection with the work of determining the boundary line between 
the United States and Mexico, Mr. Warren W. Herman contributed 
crustaceans, echinoderms, and hydractinians from Japan. Mr. Harlan 
I. Smith, of Saginaw, Mich., sent crayfishes, sponges, and bryozoans 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65 

from rivers in Micbigaii. He also transmitted some Oniscidnc. Impor- 
tant accessions were secured in excliange from the Indian Museum, 
Calcutta; jVIanchester Museum, Mancliester, England; University of 
California, Berkeley, Cal.; State University of Iowa; Leland Stanford 
Junior University ; Glen Island Museum, Glen Island, Xew York; Can- 
terbury Museum, Cbristchurcb, New Zealand; Museum of Compara- 
tive Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., and from several individuals. 

The room at the west end of the Smithsonian building, known as tlie 
" Chapel," is at present used as the exhibition hall for objects belong- 
ing to this department. The s])ace being so limited, it is necessary to 
use great care in selecting from the mass of material the most suitable 
specimens for exhibition. The result is as pleasing as is possible 
under the circumstances, and much has been done during the year 
to maintain and increase the interest of visitors. The work accom- 
l^lished in the preservation and installation of the collections, includ- 
ing not only the limited number of objects which are on exhibition, 
but also the much larger portions of the collections which form the 
reserve and study series, will be best understood from the following 
paragraphs taken from the annual report submitted by Mr. Benedict: 

The exhibition series does not ditier essentially from its condition a year ago. 
Five old-fashioned llat ebony cases in the west hall have been replaced by mahogany 
ones. The systematic series has been removed from tlie center to the north end of 
the hall, and two of tl:e table cases from near the center to the alcove. Labels for 
the collection of nionnted commercial sponges have been prepared for the printer, 
basement room formerly nsed by the department of reptiles was early in the 
assigned to this department, and with the aid of the additional storage thus 

orded it Avas jiroposed to make a more systematic arrangement of the alcoholics 
stored in the basement. But later this room was transferred to another department, 
and the contents were moved to a small and dark tower room leading from the gal- 
lery used as a workroom. 

The collection of annelids has been rearranged in a drawer stack in the gallery. 
The collections stored in homeopathic vials in the gallery'have been gone over, and 
alcohol and new stoppers added where necessary. The large collection of Alaskan 
sponges recently retiuued by Mr. Lambe has been entered in the catalogue and 
duplicates selected. In the winter it became necessary to overhaul thiity of the 
duplicate sets put up a year before, as many of the tin cases were rusted. These 
were renewed or the specimens transferred to jars. 

By far the most important work in the way of adding to the study series was the 
return of vast collections of material received from the United States Fish Commis- 
sion between the years 1871 and 1887, and stored at the Pcabody IMuseum, New- 
Haven, Conn., in charge of Prof. A. E. Yerrill, pending a report upon the same. 
In order that the return of the specimens might be facilitated, Mr. Benedict spent 
about three months of the i)ast year in New Haven, assisting in sorting and pack- 
ing under 'the direction of Professor Yerrill, the first set of duplicates being set 
aside for Professor Yerrill, and the remaining duplicates and the reserve set being 
returned to the National Museum. Much of the unidentified material has been 
treated as if named, a division being made and one set returned to the National 
Museum. The unnamed sponges were catalogued before their return, and occupy 
nearly 100 numbers in the catalogue book. Miss K. J. Bush has been employed 
tlironghout the year in dividing the jMolInsca into three sets, the third set being 
for Mr. Sanderson I. Smith. After the arrival of the material in Wa.shiugtou, an

invoice is made aud the mollnsks are turned ov^er to the department of moilnsks. 
During the year 1894-95, 68 cases of invertebrates have been shipped, coutain'ug 
about 7,500 lots of specimens. A beginning has been made in card-cataloguing the 
specimens received from this source. 

In connection with the jn-eparation of an exhibit for the Atlanta 
Exposition, it is proposed to make a series of mountings of dried si>eci- 
mens, especially dee] » sea corals, echinoderms, etc. These will later 
form a part of the i>ermaiient exhibit of the department. 

Notwithstanding the necessarily great ex})enditure of time in the 
routine work, Mr. Benedict has continued his studies of Anomura, 
especially of the large forms of the family Litliodida', resulting in a 
pai)er, describing many new genera and species, which has recently been 
published in the Proceedings of the National Museum. He has also 
devoted sucli time as he could spare to the study of the Pagurida^ 

Miss Kathbuu completed her study of the genus CoUinecte.s, and a 
report upon the same is now in press, as is also a paper containing 
descriptions of new species of fresh- water crabs. Work on the genera^ 
subject of American brachyuraus has been continued. Miss llathi 
spent about two weeks at the Museum of Comparative Zoolop' 
making comparisons of sj)ecimens, and in examining Prof. A, 
Edwards's types of West Indian crabs. 

Besides the large collections obtained from the dredgings c/ 
U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross off the west c 
Mexico, Central and South America, and off the Galapagos 
under the charge of Mr. Alexander Agassiz, and from other ex^^^^ 
tions made by the Albatross, several other explorations in this\ 
previous years have resulted in the acquisition of valuable mater^ 
such, for instance, as the deep-sea dredgings in the Indian Ocean 1, 
Her Majesty's Indian marine survey steamer Jwre.s//</^(#o/', which brought 
to the Museum a valuable collection of crustaceans and corals; t' 
natural history work of the Mexican Boundary Commission, througn 
the efforts of Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. A., and the dredgings made by 
Mr. William E. Hoyle, chieflyin the Firth of Clyde, which were deposited 
in the Manchester Museum, whence an interesting collection was trans- 
mitted to the National Museum in exchange. The Museum was the 
recipient of important collections obtained through explorations under 
the ausjuces of the Leland Stanford Junior University and the Univer- 
sity of ('alifornia, along the coast of California. The collecting expedi- 
tion of Mr. L. M.McCormick, curator of the Glen Island Museum, Glen 
Island, New York, in the vicinity of Aden, Arabia, also yielded some 
very interesting material, a part of which was secured in exchange. 

Assistance has been extended to several specialists by the loan of 
material belonging to this department. The Museum is under many 
obligations to Mr. Lawrence M. Lambe, of the Geological Survey 
of Canada, for his generous aid in the study and determinati(m of 
a large collection of sponges from the North Atlantic Ocean, and of a 
smaller collection of mounted Alaskan sponges. Prof. Edward Potts, 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67 

Pliiliidelpliia, Pa., and Dr. Walter Faxou, of the Museum of Comi)arative 
Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., have also identified collections, for whicli 
courtesies the Museum extends its most grateful acknowledgments. 
Tlie facilities of the laboratory of this department have, as usual, been 
placed at tlie disposal of specialists desiring to avail themselves of the 
privilege. 

The titles of eleven papers by Mr. Benedict, Miss Kathbun, Dr. Wal- 
ter Faxon, Mr. Lawrence M. Lam be, and others, based wholly or in 
part on Museum material, were published during the year. Five of 
these appeared in the Proceedings of the National ^Museum. They are 
all mentioned by title in the Bibliography (Appendix iv). Thirteen 
new genera, 69 new species, and one new subspecies are described in 
these papers. Their names will be found in the supplements to the 
Bibliography (Appendix iv). 

The number of entries made in the catalogues of the department dur- 
ing the year was 1,803. These were assigned to the several books, as 
follows :

HELMINTHOLOGICAL COLLECTION. 

For several years material suitable for such a collection has been 
slowly accumulating, but no attemi)t has been made until recently to 
provide for its systematic preservation and classification. In this work 
the Museum now enjoys the cooperation of Dr. 0. W. Stiles, of the 
Bureau of Animal Industry in the Department of Agriculture, who 
received a formal appointment on March 17, 1804. It is a source of 
much gratification that Dr. Stiles has found it possible to assume the 
duties of custodian of this collection, and the 3Iuseum recognizes with 
pleasure the addition of another friendly bond between the scientific 
staff of the Department of Agriculture and that of the INIuseum. 

lender date of January 9, 1894, Dr. Stiles wrote as follows regarding 
the formation of a section of helminthology : 

In order to collect and jireserve the types of American species of parasites, 
and in order to obtain a collection of the typical specimens of jiarasites of this 
and other countries, I think it would be extremely desirable if the V. S. National 
Museum would establish a department of medical zoology or helminthology. As I 
knoAV that you would favor such a step, 1 would respectfully submit the following 
proposition, in case the Museum does not see its way clear or does not think it 
possible to appoint a full curator to take; charge of this subject: 

I will tender my services as curator without pay, or as honorary curator of 
helminthology or of medical zoology, and will agree to deposit my private collection 



68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSKUM, 1895. 

ill tlie Museum, uudor such terms ;is wo shall agreo upou. as a nucleu.s of the collec 
tioii, ill case you cau give mo a room in which the si)eciineus may be kept, aiul the 
necessary apparatus (hottles, etc.) to take care of material which may be sent iu. 

Oil January 13 I addressed the following- reply to Dr. Stiles: 

I need not say that I shall be very ghid indeed to have you attached to the IVInseum 
staff iu an honorary cajjacity. I do uot think we wish to establish a section of 
medical zoology, but a section of lielminthology, in connection with one of the 
zoological euratorships, would bo very desirable. 

This letter was followed, on March 17, by a formal letter of ai)i)oint- 
meut from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 

By an arrangement already completed, thec-ollection will be enriched 
by the transfer of the collections made by the Bureau of Animal Indus- 
try and by Dr. Stiles personally. The collections of Dr. Hassall and 
Dr. Leidy will also be temporarily turned over to the Museum. By 
exchanges with museums in Berlin and Vienna, as well as with various 
specialists, much important material will, it is expected, be obtained. 
An invitation has already been extended to all workers in helmiuthol- 
ogy to deposit types or typical specimens in the Museum. Several 
colleges have been supplied with parasitic material for study, from the 
reserve series, and it is hoped that by pursuing a generous policy iu 
this direction the Museum will ultimately be the recipient of much 
desirable material. 

The greater i)art of the collection at present consists of material 
which has been obtained by Dr. Salmon, chief of the Bureau of Animal 
Industry, Department of Agriculture, Dr. Stiles, and Dr. Albert 
Hassall, who is also on the official staff of the Bureau. Dr. Salmon 
has deposited a number of types of species which have been described 
in the i)ublications of that Ikireau. Dr. Hassall has presented several 
cotypes of species described by Cobbold. Through Dr. Stiles's ottices 
a collection of types of species described by Dr. Leidy and belonging 
to the University of Pennsylvania has been secured as a loan. In 
addition. Professor Stossicli, of Trieste, Austria, has transmitted a 
number of parasites, and Dr. A. Looss, of Leipzig, Germany, has for- 
warded, in exchange, a collection of parasites from Egypt. Dr. H. B, 
Ward, of Lincoln, Nebr., has added a number of cotypes to the collec- 
tion, and from Prof. R. Ramsay Wright, Toronto, Canada, and Mr. 
Robert Mills, Chuluota, Fla., very acceptable material has been received. 
Prof A. Duges, of Guanajuato, Mexico, transmitted some specimens 
for determination. 

No attem]>t has yet been made to form an exhibition series. The 
material obtained by Dr. Stiles is retained in the Bureau of Animal 
Industry until it has been studied, after which it is formally deposited, 
according to law, iu the National Museum. 

The Bureau of Animal Industry has partly for its object the investi- 
gation of diseases of animals. The members of its staff are therefore 
constantly placed in a peculiarly favorable positiou for obt^'iniug

parasitic material. The Bureau lias published a large number of valua- 
ble papers based on its investigations, and new studies in scientific 
and economic helmmthology are being constantly commenced. Thus, 
Dr. Stiles, who has just completed his "Revision of the Adult Leporine 
Cestodes," is now engaged in a study of the cestodes of birds. 

The titles of papers published during the year by Dr. Stiles and Dr. 
Hassall, based upon material in the collections, are given in the Bibli- 
ography (Appendix iv). 

At the end of June, 1895, 106 entries had been made in the catalogue. 

DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANAT03IY. 

The curator of this department, Mr. F. A. Lucas, reports that about 
250 specimens have been added to the collection during the year. The 
accession of greatest value is the skeleton of the type of Cerrmqjra 
Chanleri. This was collected by Mr. William Astor Chanler in the Tana 
liiver region, East Africa, and was presented by him to the National 
Museum. Some desirable birds in alcohol have been received from Dr. 
Edgar A. Mearns, resulting from his participation in the work of the 
Mexican Boundary Commission. 

Under the direction of IVIr. Lucas the work of cleaning skulls of mam- 
mals and skeletons and sterna of birds has been continued. During 
the year 850 skulls have been thus treated for the dei)artment of mam- 
mals alone. These are entered in the catalogue of the mammal depart- 
ment, and therefore the total number of entries in the catalogue of 
this department is correspondingly diminished. 

Mr. Lucas has continued his studies on the anatomy of the swifts 
and the tyrant tly catchers, on the taxouomic values of the tendinal 
perforations of the tarsus in birds, and on the modifications and taxo- 
uomic value of the tongues of birds. He has also commenced a study 
of the osteology of Zeuglodon ceioides and of the cranial characters of 
the finches and tanagers. 

Specimens of birds in alcohol have been lent to Mr. Hubert Lyman 
Clark and to ]Mr, W. P. Pycraft m connection with their studies of the 
embryology and pterylog]ai)hy of birds, and other material belonging 
to the department has been transmitted for investigation and compari- 
son to Trof. 1']. D. Cope, Dr. C. S. Huntington, and Prof. 11. F. Osborn. 

Several papers by the author, based on Museum material, have been 
]niblished in the Proceedings of the National INiuseum, the "Ibis," the 
"Auk," and in "Natural Science." 

The chief drawback to satisfactory progress in this department, as 
in many of the other departments, is lack of space. Mr. Lucas has, 
however, several plans for future work laid out, and these are best 
given in his own words: 

Little can be done for tho improvement of the study series, owing to lack of room, 
but there are many specimens, especially among tlie birds, which need to be trans- 
ferred to proper boxes and Inbeled. and this will be done as fast as opportunity 
offers, while sue h sjiecimeus as can be cleaned will l)c added to the study series. 



70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The collection of lish skeletons is in bad shape owing to cramped ([narters ; but 
little or nothing can be done with it, althongh it is hoped that a little room may be 
made available by placing material now in the study series on exhibition in the 
cases recently placed above the wall case. 

Much can be done to improve the exhibition series by providing more descriptive 
labels, and there are some gaps in the series of skeletons, especially among the iishes 
and reptiles, that it is hoped may be lilled. There arc various series of specimens 
which may be either introduced or added to, among them that commenced during 
the year showing the modifications of the dermis and epidermis. A very important 
series which it is hoped may be commenced soon is that showing the morphology of 
the bones of the mammalian ear and hyoid. Another important piece of work which 
has merely been begun is the representation of extinct forms in the series of skele- 
tons. It is desirable that this should be done in order that the relations of existing 
animals may be properly understood, and it is proposed to introduce in their proper 
places typical fossils or casts of fossils, supplemented by figures of the entire skele- 
ton, these to be accompanied by suitable explanatory labels giving the anatomical 
characters, affinities, and geological range of the various orders or other groups. 
It is also desirable to extend the tooth series, the series of domesticated animals, 
and above all the synoptic series of invertebrates. 

In this connection the curator would call attention to the J'act that the care of the 
fossil vertebrates takes much of his time, and tiiat the time of the one preparator 
and one skilled laborer allotted to the department of comparative anatomy is very 
largely occupied with work for the departments of mammals and paleontology.

DEPARTMENT OF PALEONTOLOGY. 

It has for many years been felt desirable to centralize all the paleon- 
tological collections under one general administration, but not until 
the prcvsent fiscal year has it been found possible to effect the necessary 
arrangements. Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the F. S. Geological 
Survey, has accepted the honorary charge of all the paleontologicnl col- 
lections, with Mr. Charles Schuchert as assistant curator. The several 
divisions of the department which have heretofore existed still remain, 
with one exception, under the charge of the same ofiicers who have 
hitherto controlled them. The principal object gained by the change is 
that all paleontological material, as soon as it arrives at the Museum, is 
assigned to the main departmeut, thus securing a better system of 
record than formerly, aud thence it is assigned to the special division or 
divisions of the department to which it belongs. It will now also be 
possible to bring the work incident to the installation of all thei)aleou- 
tological material under one uniform system, and at the same time to

relieve several of the custodiaus of the necessity of atteudiag to the 
details of this work. 

The personnel of this department now includes lion. C. D. Walcott 
as honorary curator, witli Mr. Charles Schuchert as assistant curator. 
The vertebrate fossils are still under the charge of Prof. O. C. Marsh, 
although the actual work on these collections has been performed by 
Mr. F. A. Lucas. The invertebrate fossils are divided among Mr. Schu- 
chert, Mr. T. W. Stanton, and Dr. W. H. Dall, while the fossil plants 
remain under the general sui^ervision of Prof. Lester F. Ward, with Mr. 
F. II. Knowlton and Mr. David White as custodians of the Mesozoic 
and Paleozoic collections, respectively. 

Dr. Charles A. White, who for many years has personally had the 
entire charge of the Mesozoic (collection of invertebrate fossils, is now 
largely relieved of this work by Mr. Stanton. Dr. White has been 
designated ''Associate in Paleontology." The Museum owes a large 
debt of gratitude to him for his efficient work on tlie Mesozoic collec- 
tion of invertebrate fossils, and it is a source of congratulation that 
the advantages of his advice and honorary connection with the Museum 
are to be continued. 

The increase in and the scientitic value of the paleontological collec- 
tions received during the year are regarded as very gratifying, espe- 
cially in the case of the vertebrate fossils. This collection, under the 
curatorship of Prof. O. C. Marsh, of Yale College, has been increased 
by the addition of about 05 specimens. Among the more important of 
these is a large collection of bones of Zeuglodon gathered in Missis- 
sippi and Alabama by Mr. Charles Schuchert. Thirty vertebne of 
Zeuglodon were also obtained, in exchange, from the Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, Agricultural College, Miss. In addition, j\[r. 
Schuchert collected a large number of specimens of Middle Devonian 
corals from Moreland, Ky. A skull of bison from the Kansas gravels 
was presented by Dr. A. G. Chase, and a skull of rortheus molossus by 
Mr. E. E. Howell. Casts of a number of fossils have been obtained by 
exchanges with the Museum of Natural History in Paris, the La Plata 
Museum, and with Mr. Henry A. Ward, of Rochester, N. Y. A cast of 
a skeleton of Pelargosaurv.s ti/piis was acquired by an exchange with 
the University of Caen, France, and an excellent specimen of Ichthi/o- 
saurus from Lyme Pegis, England, was received in exchange from the 
Wagner Free Institute, Philadelphia, Pa. 

A small series of fossils has been placed on exhibition, and a num- 
ber of large casts placed on the walls or on the tops of the wall cases. 
From the collection of bones of Zeuglodon a restoration, more than 50 
feet in length, has been made for exhibitiim at the Atlanta Exposition. 
This will be added to the exhibition series after its return to Washing- 
ton. The many casts of vertebrates in foreign museums received 
during the year are of great value lor comparative and decorative pur- 
poses. Although the exhibit of this section of the paleontological 
department is but small, it has already attracted much attention, and 



72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1«95. 

tliG casts and fossil bones of large vertebrates are a constant source of 
wonder and interest to visitors, A loan of the type of Aceratherium 
occideiitdic was made to Prof. H. F. Osborn for use in liis studies of the 
extinct species of rliiuoceros in Xortli America. A large number of 
specimens received previously liave been catalogued only during this 
year. These, together with the entry of material received in 18'.)4-95, 
make a total of 283 entries in tlie catalogue, the last number taken up 
in June, 1804, being 1635, and in June, 1805, 1918. 

One of tiie most important accessions to the department of paleon- 
tology, from the standpoint of scientific value, is the collection of Ter- 
tiary insects from Colorado and Wyoming, received from the U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey. The greater part of it has already been described 
and illustrated by Prof. Samuel 11. Scudder in Monograph xxi of the 
Survey. 

The magnificent collection of fossil plants, including also some fossil 
fishes, presented by Mr. E. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa., has been referred 
to in previous reports. The removal of the collection to Washington 
was placed in the hands of Mr. David White, who has pushed the work 
rapidly forward with untiring and intelligent perseverance. The sixth 
installment has been received during the year. This consisted of two 
boxes of fishes from New Jersey, three boxes of Cretaceous and Tertiary 
plants, and 43 boxes of Paleozoic plants. 

It is expect(Ml that additional material will be received during* the 
coming year, and in the Eei)ort for 1895-90 a more extended reference 
will be made to the character and contents of this exceedingly valuable 
collection. 

Much has been accomplished toward housing and arranging the mate- 
rial. During the year 104 boxes have been unpacked, and with the 
specimens received in former years this collection fills the 600 drawers 
purchased for the collection, to which the two south tower rooms are 
devoted. The arrangement and installation of the material has been 
performed by Mr. David White. 

A large collection of Middle Cambrian fossils from British Columbia, 
fossil plants from llhode Island and Massachusetts, and fossil fishes, 
1)1 ants, and insects from the Triassic in Massachusetts, have been 
received from the U. S. Geological Survey. Mr. 11. A. Blair, Sedalia, 
Mo., has presented 60 specimens of Lower Carboniferous fossils, includ- 
ing several specimens of a well-preserved graptolite {Dictyonema). 
Their occurrence extends the known range of these coelenterates into 
the base of the Lower Carboniferous. This is a matter of considerable 
scientifi(^ importance, as graptolites had not hitherto been known to 
occur above the Middle Devonian. 

The exhibit of the paleontological material is contained, so far as at 
present prepared, in the southeast court, which has been again o])eued 
to the i)ublic. A new and more ap])ropriate entrance to the court was 
cut through the south wall, and tiie eastern one closed. The former 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73 

crowded condition of the court was relieved by removiiii;' tlie plants 
and vertebrates from the slope-top cases to the wall cases, alloNving 
eight slope-to]) cases to be discarded. Thirty-two of these cases remain 
for the exhibition oi' invertebrate fossils. The phmts and vertebrates 
are being arranged in the wall cases, with the four corners of the room 
occnpied by large slabs of tracks, standing on screens. All the fossil 
insects in the department have been asseml)led and appropriately 
mounted with figures on tiles. This collection is now on exhibition in 
a Hat-top case. 

Considerable time has been expended in caring for the paleozoic col- 
lections of the Geological Survey, 20 boxes having been unpacked and 
the specimens washed and provisionally assorted. 

Work on the paleozoic plants will be pushed to completion by Mr. 
David White, on his return to Washington. The exhibits of the meso- 
zoic and cenozoie i»l;ints are nearing completion, and the numuscript 
for the labels is nearly ready for the i>rinter. Three additional eases 
are retpiired by Professor Ward, which, with the 7 alieady assigned, 
will permit of 5 being dev^oted to tlie Lacoe collection of paleozoic; plants 
and the other 5 to mesozoic and cenozoie plants. If sufficient cases 
can be provided, it will no doubt be possible to install an exhibit of 
vertebrate fossils, under the supervision of Mr. Lucas, which will prove 
very attractive and instructive. 

The invertebrate fossils exhibited and stored in the 32 slope-top cases 
will re«iuire nnieh labor m connection with tlie selecting, mounting, 
and working up of nearly 400 boxes now in storage. Much of this 
material in storage is the property of the (Geological Survey, but is all 
at the disposal of the Museum as soon as an opportunity occurs to 
work it uj). 

The study series practically remains in the same condition as formerly 
This collection also reipiires much work to remove the duplicate mate- 
rial and to clean and enter upon the Museum registers all material 
desirable for the j)ernianent collections. 

Mr. Schuchert has continued his studies of fossil Brachiopoda, and it 
is hoped that a paper resulting from this work, to be entitled "■ Synopsi-sof 
North and South American Fossil Brachiopoda, including Bibliography 
and Synonymy" will soon be ready for publication. The special studies 
of Dr. Dall are referred to under the head of the department of mollusks. 

Material in the custody of this department has been lent for study to 
Prof. John M. Clarke, Albany, N. Y.; to Prof. William B. Clark, Johns 
Hopkius University, and to Prof. J. F. Whiteaves, of the Geological 
Survey of Canada. Fossils have been sent to Mr. E. O. Ulrich, of jSTew- 
port, Ky., and to Prof. John M. Clarke for identification, and the 
Museum is under obligations to these gentlemen for their courtesy in 
this connection. 

Although there is a great (juantity of most interesting nuiterial for 
study and descrijition on hand in all of the various collections of this 



74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

department, there has been afforded very little opportuuity for the 
preparation of papers for jmblication during the year, on acconut of the 
large amount of preliminary work necessary in the way of arrangement 
and classification. Mr. Knowlton has, however, published five ])apers 
relating to paleobotany, and in them one new genus and seven new 
species are described. 

The number of specimens received during the year, so far as they can 
be counted, is upward of G,642, not including the Lacoe collection of 44 
boxes, and the collection of bones of Zeuglodon.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANTS (NATIONAL, HERBARIUM). 

The most important matter affecting this department was the formal 
transfer of the Herbarium from the Department of Agriculture to the 
National Museum building. This was the result of correspondence 
between the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture and the Acting Secre- 
tary of the Smithsonian Institution. Copies of the letters are here 
presented. The history of the growth of the Herbarium will interest 
many, and a brief statement relative to the same is here given. 

At the time when definite lines of policy were adopted in order to 
secure the expenditure of the income of the Smithsonian Institution in 
such a manner as most effectually to carry out the intention of tlie 
founder in his purpose of promoting the ''increase and diffusion of 
knowledge among men," it was determined to make no appropriation of 
the* funds to further or support any object which could be e(iually well 
accomplished by some other agencj-. In pursuance of this policy an 
arrangement was effected with the Commissioner of Agriculture to 
transfer the iSTational Herbarium of the Institntion to the care of the 
Department of Agriculture. The Herbarium then contained 15,000 to 
20,000 specimens from all parts of the world, properly classified and 
labeled. These specimens were the result of various exi)editions of the 
Government and of special explorations carried on under the auspices 
of the Institution. The collection had from the first been under the 
care of Dr. Gray and Dr. Torrey, who served without compensation. 
Upon their retirement the desirability of ein])loying a competent bota- 
nist became obvious. On account of lack of money, however, it was not 
possible to make the position a salaried one, and therefore it became 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 75 

uecessary to seek some other meaus of providing for the care of the 
collection. The Department of Agriculture was, as already stated, 
asked to assume this responsibility. It consented, with the under- 
standing that the appointment of the botanist to be placed in charge 
should be approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 
that the collections should be accessible to the public for practical or 
educational purposes, and also accessible to the Institution for scien- 
tific investigation. It was further agreed that full credit be given to 
the Institution in the publications of the Department for the deposit of 
the original specimens as well as for such additions as the Institution 
might make from time to time. 

The following agreement was formally signed by the Commissioner of 
Agriculture and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution: 

First. All the botanical specimens in the possession of the Smithsonian Institution, 
about 20,000, and all that may hereafter be collected by it, shall Ije transferred to the 
Agricultural Department on the following terms: 

1. That a competent botanist, a^iproved by the Institution, shall be appointed to 
have charge of the collection. 

2. That the collection shall, at all times, be accessible to the }inblic lor educational 
purposes and to the Institution for scientific investigation, or for supplying any 
information in regard to plants that correspondents may ask for. 

3. That due credit be given to the Institution in the report of the Agricultural 
Department for the original deposit and for such additions as may be made to it, 
from time to time, by the Institution. 

Second. That the Agricultural Department shall transfer to the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution any specimens it may now have, or may hereafter obtain, that are not ueces- 
sary to illustrate agricultural ecouomy, such as those of ethnology and of various 
branches of natural history, similar credit to be given in this case as required in 
the former. 

The transfer was made in 1869, and the conditions were fulfilled. Dr. 
Parry was appointed botanist, and at once commenced a systematic 
arrangement of the Herbarium. He found the number of species to be 
about 15,000, included in 155,000 specimens. The most valuable portions 
of the Herbarium thus transmitted by the Smithsonian Institution to 
the Department of Agriculture were: 

1. The plants collected by the exploring expedition under Admiral 
Wilkes (1838-1842). The botanists of this expedition were Mr. William 
Rich, Dr. Charles Pickering, and Mr. W. I. D. Brackenridge. 

2. The collection of plants made by Mr. Charles Wright during the 
North Pacific Exploring Expedition, under Commanders Einggold and 
Rodgers (1853-1856). 

3. The plants collected by the naturalists who accompanied several 
surveying parties which made explorations for the route of a Pacific 
railroad. 

4. Collections made during the survey for the Mexican boundary by 
Dr. C. C. Parry, Dr. J. M. Bigelow, Mr. C. Wright, Prof. George Thurber, 
and Mr. Arthur Schott. 

5. Numerous contributions to the North American portion of the 



76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Heibaiiuni, also plants from British America, Japan, Mautcliuria, China, 
Sandwich Islands, Mexico, Jamaica, Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, and Para- 
guay; also from Hungary, Illyria, and other parts of Europe. Collec- 
tions were also received from the Imperial Academy of Science at St. 
Petersburg and from the Imperial Botanic Carden. 

During the twenty-six years following tlie transfer, up to the year 
1894, many large and valuable accessions have been added, a. large 
proportion of which was received by the Department of Agriculture. 
The Herbarium now contains not less than 275,000 specimens. 

The fact that the Herbarium was not housed in a fireproof building 
has been the occasion of criticism, and during the session of ther)0tan- 
ical Congress in Madison, Wis.,^ this subject was discussed and the 
tbllowing I'esolutions drafted: 

Whereas the Natioual Herbarium, with all its wealth of specimens of inestimable 
value, is at preseut deposited iu a buildiug which from its construction and use is 
peculiarly liable to destruction by fire; and 

Whereas such destruction would be an irreparalde loss to tlic science ot botany; 
therefore, be it 

Besolred, That we, the members of the Madison Botanical Con<>;ress, hereby appeal 
to the Senators and Representatives of the National Congress to make early provision 
for a suitable fireproof building for the preservation of this scientilic treasure, and 
we would respecti'ully request the Secretary of Agriculture to urge upon Congress 
the desirability of prompt action iu this matter. 

Actuated, no doubt, in part by the sense of responsibility involved, 
the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in a letter, having the approval 
of the Secretary of Agriculture, dated July 24, 1894, and addressed to 
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, after recognizing the 
Institution as the lawful custodian of the scientific collections of the 
Government, requested the transfer of the Herbarium to the immediate 
custody of the Institution. To this the Institution assented, in a letter 
dated July 28, 1894, signed by the Acting Secretary. A third letter, 
addiessed by the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution, dated August 16, 1894, directed the transfer 
of the Herbarium. The actual removal of the collection was effected 
in Sei»tember, 1894. 

Mr. Frederick V.Coville, botanist of the De])artment of Agriculture, 
has succeeded Dr. (leorge A^asey as honorary curator of the depart- 
ment of Itotany, and in this capacity is in charge of the National 
Herbarium. Dr. J. IST. Rose, of the Departmen.t of Agriculture, has 
been appointed assistant curator. 

The correspondence above referred to is here i)resented: 

J'lioM TMK ASSISTANT SECUETARV OF AGKICULTtTRE. 

July. 24, 1894. 

Siu: The Smithsonian Institution, as we understand it, is designated by law the 

custodian of all of the scientilic collections of the Government. This Department 

has already transferred many collections, parts of collections, and specimens to the 

care of your Institution, and will, it is hoped, continue to do so from time to time. 



• August 23, 189.'5 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 77 

Tbf collection of plants known as the National Herbarium has been left in the 
immediate charge of this Department, the expense of its care, maintenance, and 
extension being annually provided for in our appropriations 

This collection is, we are informed, a very valuable one, especially since it con- 
tains a great number of "typo sp(^cimens'' from th(> Fremont, Wilkes, and othei 
expeditions, and deserves to 1)0 housed and cared for m the most reliable and effi- 
cient manner. It is at present located in the otTfices of the division of botany in the 
main building of the Department of Agriculture. As is well known, tins building 
is not fireproof, and is considered to be unsafe for other reasons 

I write, therefore, with the approval of the Honorable Secretary, to ask the Smith- 
sonian Institution to provide a place for this collection. Being desirous ot relief 
from further responsibility for tlio safety of this collection, which is connected only 
in part with the work under our charge, we feel that we have a right to make this 
reciuest of your Institution. 

Since the botanist of the Department of Agriculture is also curator of the Her- 
barium, and since an assistant curator and several clerks and laborers are provided 
to work on it, this Department would expect to continue, through these legally 
appointed officers, to do all necessary work upon the herbarium, and must, for this 
purpose, have full access to it. 

In addition to the space re(iuired for the Herbarium proper, several rooms will be 
required for the accommodation of these workers and some storage space for duj)!!- 
cate specimens. The details of these matters will be explained by the botanist. 
This Department would expect to have the privilege of removing to its building 
from time to time any portion of the Herbarium that may be re(imred for study in 
connection with its work. The working collection of fungi in the division of vege- 
table pathology and the collections of the division of forestry, having been made 
independently of the Herbarium and its appropriations, are not considered a part 
of it and are not offered for transfer at this time. The grass collection of the Her- 
barium will also be needed at this Department for the present. 

If desired, the cases and like furniture can be transferred with the collection. 

Respectfully yours,

FROM THE A( ting SECRETAKY OF THE .SAIITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

July 28, 189!. 

Sir: I am in receipt of your letter of July 24, asking the Smith.sonian Institution 
to relieve the Department of Agriculture from the responsibility for the safety of the 
collections of plants known as the National Herbarium, by providing a place for it in 
a fireproof building. 

I appreciate fully the value of the National Herbarium, and although all the build- 
ings under the charge of the Institution are already overcrowded, I find that it is 
possible, by still further condensing, to assign to the collections of plants which you 
oiler to transfer, together with those already here, a space on one of the balconies 
in the new Museum building with the adjoining laboratory rooms, which, though 
inadequate for its proper reception will, in a certain way, meet the necessities of the 
case, and which has at least the recommendation of being free Iroin the danger of fire. 

If the ca es and other furniture referred to in your letter can be transferred to the 
Museum, I see no reason why the plants may not be received at any time that may 
suit the convenience of the Department. 

I understand it to be your purpose that the botanist of the Department of Agri- 
culture shall retain the position of honorary curator of the botauical collections iu 



7,*S KKFOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

the Natioual Museum, which he now hohls by courtesy of the Department of Agri- 
culture and bycomm'ssion from the Secretary of tlie Smithsonian Institution. This 
is very aiceiitable, as is also your proposition that certain other employees of the 
Department of Agriculture shall continue to work ui»on the herbarium under his 
direction. While the Institution is prepared to iirovide a safe place for the herbarium 
and preserve it from deterioration, it can not at present assume any expense i'or 
maintaining and enlarging it. I speak of this for the purpose of emphasizing the 
fact that if the herbarium is to fulfill its function of continued usefulness to the 
Department of Agriculture, it will be necessary that the Department shall contribute 
to its maintenance as in the past. In order to render this possible, the work-rooms 
already referred to will be available to accommodate the persons engaged in this 
work under the dii-ection of the botanist. 

Every facility will be aftorded to the Department for the use not only of the Her- 
barium to be transferred, but of all the other botanical material and collections la 
the Museum, together with the extensive botanical library belonging to the Institu- 
tion. Portions of the collection of plants may be withdrawn for study upon the 
request of the botanist of the Department of Agriculture, so far as is consistent with 
their safe-keeping and proper use. 

I note what you say in regard to the collections in the divisions of vegetable pathol- 
ogy and forestry, aud have no comment to offer. Tiie situntiou is, however, differ- 
ent in regard to the gxasses, for, since they constitute part of the herbarium proper, 
and a considerable portion of them have been deposited with the Department of 
Agriculture by the Smithsonian, it seems to me that this fact should be recognized, 
and that the custody of the grasses should be transferred to the Institution with the 
rest of the herbarium, although, in accordance with the terms of the agreement just 
stated, it is proper that as much of this collection should be retained at the Depart- 
ment as is needed for the work in progress. I would suggest, however, that a full 
series of the grasses be sent to our fireproof building as soon as practicable, so that 
in case of fire a portion of this valuabh^ collection may be saved. 

If, when you are ready to make the transfer, you will, as you suggest, request 
Mr. Coville to confer with me, I will do all in my power to have the new space 
arranged so as to provide in the best way for the interests of the work. 
Yours very respectfully, 

G. Brown Gooue, Acting Si'<relarij.

Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, ICashington City. 



from the secretary of agriculture. 

August 16, 1894. 
Sir: I have the honor to inform you that, in compliance with the arrangements 
made through corresjionilence with the Honorable Assistant Secretary of Agricul- 
ture, I have this day directed the botanist and curator of this Department to pro- 
ceed to remove the National Herbarium, its furniture, and persons engaged in 
working thereon, or so much thereof as you may be able to accommodate, to the 
S2)ace which you have kindly provided for it in the National Museum. 
Kespectfully yours, 

J. Sterling Morton, Secretary. 
The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 

Ill his report for the year eiidinj;' June 30, 1895, the curator, speak- 
ing of the more important accessions of the year, mentions G Avhich 
were received through the Smitlisonian Institution and 45 which came 
direct to the Department of Agriculture and are now deposited in the 
herbarium. References to tliese and all other accessions to the Herba- 
rium will be found in the Accession List (Appendix ii). The total 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 79 

Dumber of specimeus received and added to the Herbarium during- the 
year was 10,81)7. For the last half of the year the curator has included 
only those specimens which were actually placed in the collection. 
Previously all specimens received had been counted. 

The space now occupied by the Herbarium is the east balcony of the 
Museum building, with a floor area of lU by 02 feet, (bur tower rooms, 
each 12 by 10 feet, and two anterooms, each 8 by 10 feet. Mr. Charles 
Louis Pollard, of the Department of Agriculture, assists the curator 
and assistant curator in the administration of the collection. 

A complete revision of the Herbarium has been found necessary 
since the transfer to the Museum buildiug was made. New labels have 
been added, and the determinations of species have been carefully 
examined with a view to the correction of any errors. This revision 
has already extended to the Rubiaceii?, and it is expected that it will be 
completed during the coming fiscal year. 

The transfer to the main Herbarium of the collection hitherto stored 
on the south balcony of the Museum building has also been com- 
menced. The dicotyledonous trees and shrubs, geuera represented 
in a fossil state, and the plants collected personally by Prof. Lester F. 
Ward, who is in charge of the collection of fossil plants, will, however, 
be retained for use in the department of paleontology. 

A series illustrating the flora of the District of Columbia will be 
placed in a separate case, where it will be generally accessible to 
students. 

Dr. Rose has undertaken the work of selecting and marking all the 
type and cotype specimens in the Herbarium. The sheets to which 
these specimens are attached are taken out, marked with a red label, 
placed in a red folded cover, and then returned to their proper place in 
the collection. During the year 16,505 specimens have been mounted. 
A large part of this number consisted of specimens received in pre- 
vious years, but not before mounted on account of lack of facilities for 
the work. 

A revision of Prof. Lester F. Ward's "Gruide to the Flora of Wash- 
ington and Vicinity" has been commenced by Professor Ward and Mr. 
Pollard. Other Washington botanists will assist in special groups. 
Monographic work for the " Systematic Botany of I^orth America" has 
been commenced by the curator, Dr. Kose, and Mr. Pollard. Dr. Kose 
has completed and published a report on the Mexican collections gath- 
ered by Mr. Edward Palmer in 1890 and 1891. He has also continued 
the identification of parts of the collections obtained by Mr. 0. G. 
Pringle and Mr. E. W. Xelson in Mexico. Mr. Coville, in cooperation 
with Mr. John B. Leiberg, has identified a large collection of plants 
made by the latter in 1891 on the plains of eastern Oregon. 

The field agents of the Department of Agriculture have contributed 
a large amount of material from Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and 
Alaska. 



80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Several collections or parts of collections liave been sent to special- 
ists for study. These are mentioned under tbc bead of "Material lent 
for investigation."'' The curator names six botanists wlio bave bad 
access to tbebeibariuindurin<jf the year, to aid them in special investi- 
gations. He also gives tbe names of 23 persons wbo have cooperated 
witb tbe department, es])ecially by lending specimens for critical inves- 
tigation or by tbemselves assisting in tbe identification of species. 

In the Bibliograpby (Appendix iv) will be found tbe titles of all 
papers published during tbe year by tbe curator, tbe assistant curator, 
Mr. Pollard, and two otber collaborators, Mv. John M. Coulter and Mr. 
L. H. Dewey. In tbe supplements to tbe Bibliograpby are included 
the naiues of tbe new genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies 
described in those i)apers. 

Among tbe propositions which tbe curator submits in his report for 
the better administration of the herbarium, is a plan for atitbrding 
increased case room and tbe transfer of tbe remainder of the herba- 
rium to the Museum building. Tliis is evideiitl}- desirable, and every- 
thing possible will be done to meet Mr. Goville's wishes in this respect. 
He also recommends the e:iiployment of an assistant in cryptogamic 
botany, to properly classify and arrange the Pteridopbyta, Bryophyta, 
and Tballopbyta. 

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 2701, and in June, 1895, 
3431. 

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS. 

This dei)artment continues under the care of Prof. F. W. Clarke, chief 
chemist of tbe U. S. Geological Survey. 

The accessions to the collection of minerals have not been as numer- 
ous as during the previous year. Tbe actual number of specimens 
received was 1,053, embracing 140 accession numbers. The most 
important of these were contributed by Kev. L. T. Chamberlain and 
included, among others, the following specimens: Twenty specimens of 
minerals, including garnet, beryl, quartz, agate, thomsonite, cbloras- 
trolite, and sodalite from various localities, a carved ornament of quartz 
from Japan, 2 specimens of quartz with inclusions from the same 
locality, a specimen of turquoise in gangue from New Mexico, a car- 
buncle of garnet, Amazon-stone balls, 5 chrome iron balls, 3 cut and 
polished specimens of quartz, an oi^al from Querela ro, Mexico, a gold 
nugget from California, and 2 specimens of tourmaline from Mount 
Mica, Paris, Me. These were iiresented to tbe Smithsonian Institution 
and deposited in tbe National Museum. There were also received from 
Dr. Chamberlain, from the bequest of Mrs. Frances Lea Chamberlain, 
12 Tassi paste reproductions of antiques. 

From the IJ. S. Geological Survey have been received 8 accessions 
of more than usual value. Three important lotsof minerals were acquired 
by exchange. Tlie names of all the contributors to the collection are 
mentioned in tbe Accession List. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81 

Considerable i)rogress h;is been made in snpplying- the exhibition 
series with Libels. The cases have been numbered and labels attached. 
Tliese indicate the plan of arrangement and the location of the mate- 
rial. Experiments have been made with a view to determining the 
best method of mounting crystals and preserving specimens which are 
liable to decomposition. A special set of specimens, designated the 
"educational series," is being prepared for exhibition. The collections 
of gems and meteorites are increasing very satisfactorily. Two collec- 
tions of minerals have been made by Mr. Wirt Tassin, assistant cura- 
tor, aggregating more than 200 specimens. These have been suitably- 
distributed among the exhibition and study series. The field parties 
ot the United States Geological Survey brought in much interesting 
material. 

Four papers l)y the curator were published during the year — one as 
a bulletin of the Geological Survey, two in the American Journal of 
Science, and one in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. 
These are mentioned in the Bibliograi)hy (Appendix iv). 

It is the hope of the curator to establish a series of specimens illus- 
trating tyi)ical famous American localities, and also a series illustrating 
the type and original material in the collection, accompanied by refer- 
ences to the publications in which the material was described. The 
preparation of a guidebook to the collection has been commenced by 
Mr. Tassin. 

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 83320, and in June, 1895, 
83G13. 

DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 

There is pressing need of more exhibition space for the geological 
collections, and owing to the crowded condition of the halls very little 
can be added to the exhibition series. The present aim of the curator, 
Mr. George P. Merrill, is therefore in the direction of eradicating the 
poorer specimens and substituting better ones in their places. For 
this reason probably not more than 200 specimens have been actually 
added to the exhibition series during the year. Mr. Merrill repeats his 
recommendation that a balcony be placed around the interior of the 
southwest court, of sufficient capacity to hold some of the lighter and 
least bulky of the collections. This would allow room on the floor 
for the expansion of the other collections in this departmeiit. Unfor- 
tunately, Congress hus not taken favorable action on the request for 
permission to erect galleries, and until this point has been secured, 
nothing can be done to relieve the pressure either in this or the many 
other departments which are similarly hampered. 

The time of the curator and his assistant has been largely occupied 

in bettering the condition of the exhibition series, as already intimated, 

and in bringing the records of the department down to date. A card 

catalogue for the collections is being prepared, and manuscript for

uearly 1,000 new labels lias been written. The systematic collection of 
rocks has been entirely rearranged, and the labels of the building stone 
collection renewed. A large quantity of duplicate material has been 
sorted out to be used in making up the next sets of speciujens for dis- 
tribution. The curator has, in addition to the large amount of routine 
work accomplished, found time to bring to com j)letion his investigation 
relating to the mineral nature and cause of flbrous structnre of the 
various minerals commercially groul^ed under the name " Asbestos." 
lie is also engaged in a series of investigations relative to the phenom- 
ena attending rock decomposition. A brief paper on this subject, as 
illustrated in the region about Washington, has been published during 
the year in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. The 
title of this and live other papers by the curator, and of one by Mr. 
C. Whitman Cross on "The Laccolitic Mountain Groups of Colorado, 
Utah and Aiizona", in which are described some rocks in the Museum 
collection, will be found in the Bibliography (Appendix iV). 

The accessions of the year numbered 79, and in addition 122 lots of 
specimens were received for examination and report. The most impor- 
tant of the former are: A systematic series of Stassfurt salts, pre- 
sented by the German Kali Works (Nassau street, New York City); 
a series of specimens of i^hotographs of borax salts, mines, and 
works, presented by the Pacific Borax Company (San Francisco, Cal.); 
a series of granites, marbles, alabaster, etc., from Egypt, collected for 
the Museum by Mr. F. W. Crosby ; a large quantity of ITintahite, from 
Clear Creek, Utah, received from Mr. B. W. Rice, Tucker, Utah; a 
block of meerschaum from Eski Shehr, Asia Minor; a series of soap- 
stone, asbestos, ai)atite,and fresh and decomposed rocks illustrating 
weathering, collected by the curator in Nelson and Albemarle counties, 
Va.; onyx from Lake Oroomah, Persia, presented by Rev. S. G. Wil- 
son, Tabriz, Persia; a series of remarkable spherulites from the Silver 
Cliff region, Colorado, presented by Mr. C. Whitman Cross; a series 
of silverores from Custer County, Colo., transmitted by the U. S. Geolog- 
ical Survey, and a large nodiile of gum copal, weighing 8^ pounds, 
fi'om the Upper Congo region in Africa, obtained by Mr. J. H. Camp, 
Lima, Ohio, who collected for t?he Museum while engaged as a missionary 
in the service of the American BapHst Missionary Union. 

The present condition of the collection is indicated by the following 
figures : 

Exhibition series 22, 435 

Study series 28, 411 

Microscopic slides 4, 000 

Duplicates of all kinds 12,000 

Total 66, 846 

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 02393 and in June, 1895, 
62731. It should be remarked in this connection that an entry in the 
catalogue does not by any means necessarily indicate the addition of

only one specimen, since a specimen may be broken n]) into a hundred 
or more pieces, each of whicli would in a strict count be properly 
regarded as a separate specimen. 

DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 

The curator, Prof. Otis T. Mason, reports that the accessions of this 
year compare very favorably with those of previous years. Many 
additions have resulted from gifts received from foreign exhibitors at the 
World's Columbian Exposition. Among the most important accessions 
may be mentioned a rare collection of 662 specimens, illustrating the 
divinatory games of various peoples, from the University of Pennsyl- 
vania; a very valuable series of specimens from eastern Turkestan, 
collected and presented by I)r. William L. Abbott, through whose gener- 
osity several of the departments in the Museum have been enriched 
both in this and in previous years; a large collection from west Africa, 
presented by Mr. J. H. Camp aiul illustrating the arts and industries of 
several native tribes; an extremely valuable lot of ethnological objects 
from the region of Mount Kiliina-Njaro, collected and presented by Mr. 
William Astor Chanler; a collection from east Greenland, gathered 
by Captain Holm and transmitted in the name of the Museum of Royal 
Antiquities in Copenhagen, and a collection of nearly 700 articles 
illustrative of the native life and arts of the Congo Free States, secured 
by purchase from Mr. Dorsey Mohun. The Bureau of Ethnology has 
contributed a most important series of objects collected by Mr. W J 
McGee among the Papagos and Seri Indians in southwestern Arizona 
and northwestern Mexico. 

The already overcrowded condition of the exhibition space assigued 
to this department has rendered it necessary to place in storage most 
of the recently acquired material, and, to partially accommodate it, the 
lower rooms of the west balcony have been provided with shelving. 
Here it is proposed to store unit boxes, swinging screens, and mounted 
pictures. In the north storage room will be kept the reserve and study 
series illustrating the ethnology of Asiatic and North African tribes. 
The third story of the north tower is devoted to Eskimo material. A 
card catalogue of the entire exhibit is being prepared. 

Regarding the exhibition series, the curator remarks: 

The exhibition .series in the department of ethnology at the close of the fiscal 
year was to be found in two groups — tlie material actually on exhibition for public 
insi>ection and the exhibition series returned from the Chicago Exposition, which 
had been filed away for future use. A great many of these were also designated to 
be sent to Atlanta. The series actually displayed is exhibited under two motives — 
the first that of technology, the second that of ethnology. Wherever the material 
is sufficiently abundant, and from a great number of localities, the whole of man- 
kind are considered to be of one sj^ecies, and all objects belonging to a certain class 
are assembled and arranged for the purpose of showing their historical elaboration 
and their geographic distribution. This is called the technographic series. How- 
ever, where there is a large mass of material of great variety from many peoples and 
not exclusively collected from any one, the speciuieus are displayed at present iu

etlinograpliic groups and arranged around the hall. There are sections devoted to 
Negroid Africa, Caucasian peoples in Africa and Asia, the peoples of eastern Asia, 
including Siam, Burma, Japan, Korea, Thibet, and the Ural-alta group. 

This arrangement enables the curator to place before the x>ublic, at least in its 
proper national and geographic connection, desultory material from all parts of the 
world. As regards the American collection, a great change has been proposed — to 
set apart- the northwest range for the continent of America, a special exhibit to be 
made of the Pueblo region iu the northwest court. This plan has only been jjurtly 
carried out. 

The curator lias made a special study during: the year of i^rimitive 
methods of travel and transportation, and a paper by him on this sub- 
ject is printed in the Report for 1894. 

Material in the Museum has been lent for study to Mr. Stewart Culin, 
director of the Museum of Archiieology and Paleontology, University 
of Pennsylvania; to Dr. W. J. Hoffman in connection with his studies 
of the j)ictographic work of the Eskimo, and to Mr. J. D. McGuirc in 
connection with his investigations of stoneworking among savage 
peoples. The use of the drill has been thoroughly studied by Mr. 
McGuire, and the results are embodied in a very interesting paper 
published in the Report for last year. Dr. Boas has prosecuted an 
extended study of the Indians of the Northwest Coast, and a valuable 
paper by him upon this subject is included iu this volume. 

The curator has published seven papers during the year, including a 
study of "North American Bows, Arrows, and Quivers" (printed in the 
Ifeport of the Smithsonian Institution for 1893). Mr. Walter Hough, 
assistant curator, prepared a catalogue of the ethnologica) exhibit dis- 
l)layed by the National Museum at the Columbian Historical Exposition 
in Madrid, and also a descriptive report upon the ancient Central and 
South American pottery exhibited in Madrid on that occasion. 

Alluding to the special plans which he has in view, the curator makes 
the following statement: 

The curator commenced at the end of the fiscal year to make a classified catalogue 
of every ethnological specimen in the collection, vitb regard to its function, mate- 
rial, and its location, for the purpose of indicating geographically the poverty of the 
department, especially with reference to American material. For instance, all the 
stocks of the American race, from Point Barrow to Cape Horn, are arranged alpha- 
Itetically and in the order of their location. It is proposed to have a separate sheet or 
column connected with these stocks as they occur, devoted to each of the great 
typical industries, activities, or apparatus, and to indicate upon these sheets or in these 
colunnis Avhether or not each stock has in use this method or apparatus. As soon as- 
this chart is made out, it can be easily ascertained whether any tribe possesses this 
or that art, and if the materials and tools connected with the art are not iu the 
National Museum, it will indicate an intelligent line along which collections ought 
to be made. 

The curator hopes to devote a great deal of attention to this special research dur- 
ing the next year and to utilize the resources of the establishment, with the consent 
and assistance of the Director, for the purpose of perfecting the series for America. 

There have been 1,270 entries made during the year in volumes 35 
and 37 of tlie catalogue of the department. In volume 35 the entries 
run from 16885.3 to 1<;9339, and in volume 37 from 17442G to 175221. 

The number of specimens received was 2,012. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 85 

DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 

In bis annual report the curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson, remarks that 
the operations of this year have exceeded those of all previous years 
in the number and extent of the accessions as well as in their scientific 
vahie. The most important addition, although not a permanent gift, 
was the extensive collection of Dr. Roland Steiner, of Grovetown, Ga. 
It consists of 32,478 specimens from the Etowah mounds and from 
Burke and Columbia counties, Ga. The value of this collection consists 
chieiiy in the opportunity which it affords for a study of the industries 
of the aborigines as manifested in their dwellings, burial places, imple- 
ments, and utensils. The Nicaraguan Government contributed a valu- 
able collection of pottery and stone objects from the exhibit of that 
Eepublic at the Madrid Exi^osition. Mr. John C. Meyer, of Eound Top, 
Fayette County, Tex., presented a large series of rude chipped imple- 
ments and other objects, including three chipped imx)lements of jasper. 
Eleven large pottery vases from Argentina were received from the La 
Plata Museum, through the courtesy of Dr. F. P. Moreno. In addi- 
tion, the curator makes special mention ot several other accessions, all 
of which are included in the Accession List (Appendix ii). 

Several important changes having become desirable in the arrange- 
ment of the entire collection, the curator has devoted himself assiduously 
to this work, and the operations incident to the arrangement are 
indicated in his own words: 

In order to effect this task, it was necessary to rearrange, geographically, all 
the objects in 52 cases, according to the various States of the United .States and of 
foreign countries; also to rearrange the objects made by or Ijelonging to prehistoric 
man, contained in 12 cases. The latter have been arranged in two synoptical series — 
chronological and geographical— one representing Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the 
other North America. The objects from Mexico, the "West Indies, Central America, 
and South America were installed in wall cases on the north and west sides of the 
hall. All of the Pacific Coast objects were segregated and installed in cases by 
themselves, and the mummies were placed in the long wall cases on the south side 
of the hall. Two new shelves have been made for each alcove case and 900 specimens 
of mound pottery placed thereon. The very large specimens were placed above the 
alcove cases, fronting the aisles, thus giving them a decorative, as well as utilitarian, 
effect. The prehistoric pottery has been transferred from the Museum building, and 
the large glass cases of pottery from Pern, Brazil, and from the Arkansas mounds 
have been installed in the foyer of the hall. A large case containing a group of 
Indian figures, representing a quarry workshop (?) from Piney Branch, District of 
Columbia, has also been set up. A number of paintings, drawings, lithographs, and 
photographs of prehistoric objects have been placed on the walls above the cases. 
These included a large painting representing the ruins of Spruce Tree House, Mancos 
Canyon, Colorado, Major Powell's map of the linguistic stocks of North America, 
and a chronological map adapted to show the distribution of aboriginal mound dis- 
tricts in the United States. Two hundred and forty drawers were constructed and 
placed in eight sloping-top table cases with frosted glass doors. This work was 
completed March 19, and since that time the drawers have been utilized for the 
storage of some 3,500 objects belonging to the collection. 

The exhibition series is now so installed that every object can be 
plainly seen. Labels have been attached to many of the specimens. 



86 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The curator lias commenced a study of prehistoric pipes aud smoking 
apparatus, and of aboriginal musical instruments. lie has also con- 
tinued special investigations of paleolithic implements, rude notched 
axes, prehistoric copper, jade and cache implements, and prehistoric 
Etruscan objects. A paper by the curator on the history of the sign 
of the Swastika has been completed and is printed in the Report for 
181)4, Various other objects connected with the existence of prehistoric 
man in North America have also engaged special attention. 

On two occasions specimens from this department were lent for use 
in illustrating lectures. The pupils of several schools in the city have 
visited the exhibition hall and received instruction from the curator as 
to the scope aud aims of the exhibit. 

Eight papers by the curator, relating chiefly to matters pertaining to 
his department, have been published during the year. The following 
remarks, bearing upon the special plans which the curator has in view 
for tlie future development of the department, are quoted from his 
anniuvl report: 

The coUectioos in this departuieut have now increased to 203,520 objects. The 
benefit to science of such a collection is by enabling the archa!ologist and anthro- 
pologist to write a history of prehistoric man. In ethnological collections and 
objects relating to primitive jjeoples of modern times, the study of the people's 
habits and customs, and the writing of tbeir history, can be done by the historian 
personally visiting the tribes and obtaining his information at iirst hand. Hut in 
collections relating to prehistoric peoples this can not bo done, and we are driven to 
a study of the implements, objects, monuments, etc., left by them. The student, 
historian, arclucologist, and anthropologist compare these objects (1) with each 
other, in localities where they have been associated together; (2) with implements 
Irom other localities; (3) he compares oue locality with another, and (4) all of them 
together with each other — that is, he first establishes, as well as he is able, a nnit of 
civilization or culture within a given tribe, group, or family; then, by extending his 
observations, be establishes other units of culture or civilization in other tribes, 
groups, or families, and these units he respectively compares together, first in a 
general way, aud second, in the details of the implements and objects which go to 
make them up. 

I propose to make from the specimens in my department such a segregation by 
localities; a division, if possible, by time; also an establishment of units of civili- 
zalion, and thus make the comparison mentioned, or, rather, afford material for stu- 
dents either now or hereafter to make this comparison of civilizations. This will 
re(iiiire the s(!rvices of a draftsman. As no person can by mere words describe the 
form of an object, and as the differences of form are, or may be, but slight, aud yet 
mean much, there is greater necessity for graphic delineation than there would oth- 
erwise be. The objects have all been made by hand; there never was any special 
pattern for the workman to follow; each man, to a large extent, made every kind of 
object, so the differences become more important and the necessity for drawing 
greater than it would be under other circumstances. It would not be true to say 
there were no type specimens of the objects made by the aboriginal man, because if 
he made each one by hazai'd, as there are a hundred times more implements than 
styles, some of them must pattern after the others, and thus some implements have 
come to be considered types. But this, I thiuk, is entirely arbitrary, aud is the 
decision of the modern student rather than the action or intention of the aboriginal 
workman. In the endeavor to discover his intention, it is necessary to make draw- 
ings enough of the implements to show these types and the dift'erences in their 
details. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 87 

During the year OGO specimens were distributed, principally in 
exchange. Many persons who come into possession of stone imple- 
ments and are anxious to learn something of their siguificance send 
them to the Museum for examination. In 1805 there were received for 
this purpose ;>8 lots, aggregating 552 specimens. Eeports are invaria- 
bly transmitted to the senders as soon as the specimens have been 
examined, and in most instances the latter are returned. 

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 109510, and in June, 
1895, 172315. 

DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRIES. 

At the time when the department of ethnology was established in 
the National Museum, there were large accumulations of ethnological 
objects from various sources which could not be regarded as purely 
ethnic material, not being specially connected with or illustrative of 
special tribes of men, but which rather formed parts of series of arts 
scattered over the entire earth. Such arts might be regarded as folk 
inventions and as illustrating a part of the great scheme of human 
invention. It was necessary to tind a place for these objects, and sev- 
eral special groups, among which they might be properly distributed, 
were established. These formed what has since been known as the 
" Department of Arts and Industries." Thus the sections of foods, tex- 
tiles, fisheries, naval architecture, travel and transportation, the medi- 
cines of all peo])les, music, and several others, came into existence. In 
them the objects are arranged under different classes of types, accord- 
ing to their structure, and in each class the objects are further arranged 
according to a system of historic development and elaboration. The 
Museum records now show that 14 sections have been organized, 
although some of these are still without custodians. These are: 
(1) Naval architecture; (2) transportation; (3) textiles; (4) foods and 
chemicals; (5) fisheries; (<>) animal products; (7) graphic arts; (8) histor- 
ical collections, coins, and medals; (9) physical apparatus; (10) musical 
instruments; (11) x>orcelains and bronzes; (12) materia medica; (13) 
forestry; (14) oriental antiquities and religious ceremoinal objects. 

Technological collections. — The first four sections in the enumeration 
above have been placed in charge of Mr. J. Elfreth Watkins, who, on 
February 1, 1895, was designated " Curator of the technological collec- 
tions." To these, other sections will be added as occasion and oppor- 
tunity may arise. The development of these collections will be slow, 
inasmuch as objects which were used by man in the foundation of many 
of the arts are very difiScult to obtain. Again, the bulkiuess of 
many objects which would be most desirable, would render them, even if 
obtainable, too cumbersome for installation, nor could space be assigned 
for the installation of such relics, owing to the already crowded condi- 
tion of the Museum halls. In cases where large objects can be repre- 
sented by models, the curator suggests the construction of small models, 
varying from one-fifth to one- tenth natural size where it is desired to 



88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

show tlie details of machinery, and from one-twentieth to one-fiftieth 
where only form and general proportions need to be considered, as in 
the case of buildings, ships, etc. Scale drawings, photographs, or 
other representations of objects illustrating the earlier steps in the 
epoch-making arts, would be desirable. From them small models can 
be made. These, accompanied by labels containing sketches iu outline, 
explaining graphically such details as are precluded by the limitations 
of a small model, may be made the means of illustrating the history of 
the beginnings of the more important American industrial arts. Such 
a scheme might at first be thought to duplicate to a certain extent the 
work of the Patent Office in that direction. It will be remembered, 
however, that the records of that ofiice contain only such documents 
and models as have been presented for examination and adjudication 
by j)ersons mainly interested in drawing up claims. This would not 
interfere with a presentation of the most important epoch-making 
inventions, such as Henry's electromagnetic sound telegraph. 

The curator will endeavor to extend the series illustrating the begin- 
nings of the steamboat. By the addition of a few models to the pres- 
ent collection, the Museum would have a very satisfactory exhibit. He 
also has in view the preparation of a case containing models illustrat- 
ing presses and machinery relating to the early steps in the art of 
printing and paper making. 

During the present fiscal year few objects of special importance were 
received. Among the most interesting were several pieces of appara- 
tus used by Prof. Joseph Henry in his investigations of electromaguet- 
isiu, which led to the invention of the magnetic telegraph. These had 
for many years been preserved in the Smithsonian building, but have 
now been placed on exhibition with other pieces of apparatus used by 
Professor Henry and deposited in the Museum by his daughters. A 
special case is devoted to peri)eruating the history of the imi)ortaut 
discoveries in electricity which he made. A model of his first electro- 
magnetic sound telegraph apparatus, made by John Schultzbach, of 
Washington, under Mr. Watkins's supervision, has been added to the 
collection, and other models, prepared for exhibition at the Atlanta 
Exposition, will be installed in the Museum at its close. The curator 
has not yet had an opportunity to rearrange the collection of models of 
vessels. Oapt. J. W. Collins, who was formerly in charge of this col- 
lection, has, since his resignation, been employed by the ]\Iuseum to 
prepare a full descriptive catalogue which will serve as a history of 
naval architecture as illustrated by the models and other objects in the 
Museum. This work was commenced on April 1. With a view to 
maturing plans for a systematic rearrangement, a model of the exhibi- 
tion hall devoted to naval architecture has been made, and also rough 
models of all the boats suspended from the roof. The work of rear- 
rangement will be advanced as soon as the necessary sup[)orts are iu 
l)lace. Many of the boats were taken down, cleaned, and measured

preparatory to their heiug described by Captain Collius in the cata- 
logue ah^eady alhided to. On account of the limited space available 
for purposes of exhibition, the collections showing- the various stages 
of development in the sewing machine and the typewriting machine, 
have been i)laced in storage. 

Mr. Watkius has devoted considerable study to the evolution of the 
various methods of transportation, and, referring to this subject in his 
annual report, he says: 

During such time as was not consumed bj^ other duties during April, May, and 
June, 1895, 1 coutiuued the investigations (whicli I have been engaged in for several 
years) of the circumstances which led to the final improvement in the wheel and 
the other mechanical devices which have tendered the aTtainmeut of high speeds 
possible in the art of transportation on land and water, which have proven such an 
important factor in modern civilization. The results of these investigations are 
embodied in the models prepared for the Atlanta Exposition, the drawings for which, 
together with the superintendence of their construction and the preparation of 
labels, have consumed much time. Each of the labels for the models illustrating 
laud conveyance contains, in addition to a brief printed description, a small sketch 
whicli gives more information at a glance than could be conveyed to the average 
museum visitor by many printed words. It is my belief that this same idea, extended 
and modified by the duplication of these sketches by some photomechanical jn-o- 
cess, may be made extremely useful, not only in connection with museum specimens 
on exhibition, but for permanent record in catalogues and elsewhere. A series of 
these illustrated labels, properly arranged, can with a few additions be made to 
form an illustrated handbook of the collection. 

It is proper to make special mention of the assistance rendered by 
Dr. Francis B. Stevens, of Hoboken, N", J., whose aid in preparing the 
drawings for the machinery of the models illustrating the early history 
of the steamboat has been invaluable. 

lu this connection Mr. Watkins adds: 

Dr. Stevens, a distinguished engineer, now in the eighty-third year of his age, 
has acquired by observation and practice a fund of information concerning early 
mechanical history in America of the greatest imjiortance. To have been able to 
act as the medium for preserving this history through the collections in the U. S. 
National Museum, I regard as a great privilege. 

The help extended by Mr. George C. Maynard in obtaining for the 
Museum relics and other objects desirable for the collections is also very 
highly appreciated. Mr. Maynard is associated with several societies 
which were organized for the purpose of preserving the history of elec- 
trical and mechanical inventions in general. 

In the general catalogue only six entries have been made during the 
year, the last number being 11H2()0. The objects pertaining to naval 
architecture are entered in a separate catalogue book, which is now, as 
above indicated, being prepared bj- Captain Collins. Other books are 
kept for the entry of accessions to the collections of textiles, foods, and 
chemicals. 

The (jraphic artu collection. — The absence of the curator in Europe 
(luring the last half of the tiscal year (January to June) has curtailed the 
operations of the department, and the following remarks have reference 



90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

therefore to what was accomplished duriug the first six months of the 
year (July 1 to December 31, 1804). 

The principal contributors of specimens were Mr. N. S. Amstutz, 
Cleveland, Ohio; Mr. J. M. Falconer, Brooklyn, N.Y.; Mr. J. W.Osborne, 
Washington, D. C. ; the United States (reological Survey, and Mr. W. 
W. Wallingford, Washington, D. C. The entry of the accessions took 
up 61 catalogue numbers (5501-5561). The most interestiug of these 
are 44 specimens illustrating the transmission of photographs bj"- means 
of electricity. They were contributed by Mr. N. S. A mstutz, the inventor 
of the i^rocess. A photomechanical color-print was purchased from the 
United States Aluminum Printing Plate Company, New York, and a 
book containing chromolith jgraphs was obtained in exchange. The 
duplicates, which are not included in the above total, have been sepa- 
rated. A catalogue of the specimens on exhibition has been prepared, 
and also a card catalogue of the whole collection. This is arranged by 
technical divisions, preliminary to a more systematic arraugement 
later on. 

Materia medica. — This collection is again under the charge of Dr. 
James M. Flint, U. S. N., who resumed his connection with the Museum 
May 24, 1895. For several years the collection has been practically 
complete, and little remains to be done except to replace specimens 
from time to time with fresh material and to substitute new labels for 
old. Only five specimens were received during the year. These were 
recorded under catalogue numbers 142309 to 142313, which is the last 
entry of the year. 

The historical collections. — There is a continually increasing interest 
shown in objects relating to the history of the United States during the 
colonial and Revolutionary periods. If sufficient exhibition space were 
available, the material already on hand would permit a very interesting 
and fairly complete exhibit in these directions, but unfortunately it is 
impossible under tlie circumstances to provide room for more than 
a limited number of objects, consisting chiefly of personal relics of 
illustrious statesmen and soldiers. 

The most interesting addition to the collections during the year con- 
sists of a number of utensils and objects of wearing apparel used in 
New England during colonial times. They illustrate in a very satisfac- 
tory manner the customs and costumes of the seventeenth and eight- 
eenth centuries. The donor is Mr. John B. Cop]), Old Mystic, Conn. 
Among other accessions are: A sword belt presented to Admiral S. D. 
Trenchard by the Government of Great Britain for his services in res- 
cuing the officers and crew of the British bark Adieu off Cape Ann, 
Massachusetts, in August, 1850; an old Si)anish sword of the kind 
used by the Conquistadores in Santo Domingo; a sword from Puerto 
Rico bearing the date 1790; early Spanish .spurs from Argentina and 
San Domingo; a collection of early Spanish Mexican copper and silver 
coins; a cabinet containing 102 plaster casts of historic medals and 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 91 

cameos, presented by llev. Dr. L. T. Chamberlain; a waistcoat supposed 
to have beh)nged to Gen. George Washington, deposited by Mrs. J. A, 
Kodgers, South Bethlehem, Pa.; a canteen carried through the Revolu- 
tionary war by John Paulding, one of the captors of Major Andre, 
deposited by Gen. R. W. Meade; a collection of South Carolina colo- 
nial paper money, and another of silver, nickel, and copper coins of 
Mexico, Danish West Indies, Great Britain, and Switzerland, received 
from Mr. A. W.Carey, Adrian, Mich.; a sword and epaulets worn by 
Capt. Seth Britt Thornton, U. S. A., at Contreras during the last 
attack on the City of Mexico ; decorations and papers of the late Joseph 
Smolinski, commander of the Imperial Ottoman (Jrder of the Medjidish, 
Chevalier of the Polisli Military Cross, etc., deposited by his son Joseph 
Smolinski, of Washington, D. C, and a model of the Behaim globe, 
the original of which was made at ]!^uremburg in 1487. 

In all, -Jl*8 specimens were added to the collection during the year. 

Collection of musical instruments. — For reasons explained in previous 
reports, no attempt has yet been made to permanently install this col- 
lection, which is now one of the largest in the world. A considerable 
number of instruments were obtained from several foreign exhibits at 
the World's Columbian Exposition, and these have been catalogued 
and either installed in the long wall cases on the east and west sides of 
the north hall or have been placed in storage. 

No accessions of special value have been received during the year. 
Mention may be made, however, of "1 instruments from Ceylon and 5 
from Johore, Malay Peninsula, inircbased from the Field Columbian 
Museum; a native lyre from Congo, Africa, received from Mr. J. H. 
Camp ; a Japanese vertical flute, a transverse flute, and a double whistle 
from Mr. Simon A. Stern, of Philadelphia, Pa,; a vertical flute from 
New Hebrides, a horn from Friesland, Holland, a virginal made in 1(>02 
and a Broadwood piano, from Mrs. J. Crosby Brown; a wooden bell, or 
logo, from Mr. H. J. Moors, of Apia, Samoa; a flageolet and an oboe 
from Tibet, presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott; a guirro (a sort of whistle), 
from Puerto Rico, and a tiple (a small guitar), from the same locality, 
presented by Mrs. Charles B. Smith, of Washington, D. C. 

The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects. — 
These collections are the outgrowth of the establisliment of a section of 
the department of arts and industries in 1888, under the honorary 
curatorship of Dr. Paul Haupt, of the Johns Hopkins University, for 
the accumulation and preservation of objects illustrating oriental anti- 
(j^uities and ceremonials connected with religious worship of all kinds. 
Dr. Cyrus Adler, librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, is in charge 
of these collections, and under his immediate care they have been 
arranged. They now occupy four alcoves in the east and west halls, near 
the rotunda. The north alcove in the east hall contains the Egyptian col- 
lections, arranged in eight cases. The Assyro-Babylonian collections 
are in the south alcove in the same hall, also arranged in eight cases. 



92 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1«95. 

In the north alcove of the west hall are the Jewish, Mohammedan, and 
Gra^co-Eomaii religious collections, while in the south alcove, op])osite, 
are arranged the religious objects relating to Brahmanism, Buddhism, 
and Shiiitoisin. 

The principal additions during the year were a Siamese edition of 
the sacred writings of the Southern Buddhists, presented by the King 
of Siam; the liturgy of the Bene Israel of Bombay in the Maratha lan- 
guage, presented by Eev. Henry Cohen, Galveston, Tex., and a Jap- 
anese temple drum, deposited by Dr. G. Brown Goode. The Museum 
is also indebted to Mr. E. Dorsey Mohun, United States consul at Zan- 
zibar, for copies of the Korau, a Koran stand, and prayer mats, and to 
Eev. Henry Cchen for four volumes of Jewish liturgy. 

Casts of the Temple stone, Siloam inscription, and twelve Assyrian 
seals were sent to Eev. C. C. Newton, Tokyo, Japan, in exclmngp for 
Buddhistic and Shinto objects. 

Much progress has been made in the installation of the objects now 
on exhibition. This matter is referred to more in detail in the chapter 
entitled "The development and arrangement of the exhibition series." 
All of the collections not on exhibition have been rearranged and put 
in storage cases. The molds and casts have been placed in the base- 
ment of the Smithsonian building, where they are safe and easily 
accessible. 

Dr. Adler has commenced a study of Jewish ceremonial institutions. 
He has also continued his study of ancient oriental seals, and in this 
work has had the opportunity of examining a large collection of seals 
belonging to Dr. Frederick Stearns, of Detroit, Mich. Casts were made 
of 82 of these specimens. He has also completed a paper on the "Cot- 
ton Grotto near Jerusalem and ancient Methods of Quarrying." This 
is based partly on objects which he has presented to the Museum. 

It is Dr. Adler's desire to gather a collection of Hittite casts and a 
series of amulets. 

During the year 171 specimens were received. The entries in the 
catalogue were contained between numbers 15481G and 1541)90. 



IV.— REVIEV;^ OF \A^ORK IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE 

DEPARTMENTS. 

FINANCE, PROPERTY, SUPPJ.IES, AND ACCOUNTS. 

Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk, presents, in his annual rei)ort, a detailed 
statement showing the amount of the appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending- June 30, 18115, and the disbursements thereunder; also the dis- 
position of the unexpended balances remaining on hand from the 
appropriations of previous years. These statements are printed in 
Ai)i)endix vin. 

The work pertaining to the accounts connected with the disburse- 
ment of the funds allotted to the National Museum, for an exhibit at 
the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, has entailed 
considerable extra work upon the force of this office during the present 
year. This work, however, as well as the preparation of orders for 
materials and labor, has been i^erformed without any additional help. 

In the early part of the fiscal year steps were taken with a view to 
bringing suit against persons who declined to enter into contracts 
which had been awarded them for furnishing supjilies, etc The opinion 
of the Attorney-General was sought, and although the Smithsonian 
Institution has not up to this time been recognized as being entitled to 
this privilege, the action taken resulted in suits being brought against 
the defaulters by the Department of Justice. 

A board was apitointed August 13, 1894, to examine and report upon 
the safety of the alcohol and alcoholic si>ecimens stored in the base- 
n)entof the Smithsonian building. Additional safeguards were recom 
mended, and these have been provided. 

A new telephone service, with metallic circuits and long-distance 
instruments, was installed during the year, and although the service is 
much improved, the annual rental charged is less than that formerly 
paid. 

The chief clerk states that the rules adopted last year for the govern- 
ment of the watch force have been adhered to, and that as a result the 
force has been brought to a higher state of efficiency. 

The committee appointed to consider the subject of an improved sys- 
tem of locks for the Museum cases, submitted its report at the close of 
the preceding fiscal year, and during the presentyear preliminary steps 
have been taken with a view to carrying out the recommendations made- 



94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The quarters occupied tor storage liaviug beeu found too small for the 
purpose, a uew building was leased on the 15th of June of the ]>resent 
year, and the transfer made a short time thereafter. 

In February, 1895, an order was issued defining more particularly the 
duties of the engineer. 

The chief clerk makes a statement in his report regarding the records 
of his office, from w^hich the following is taken : 

The originals of all requisitions for purchases, etc., are bound into 
volumes of convenient size, for ready reference. A record is kept of all 
bills and vouchers for expenditures on account of appropriations, and 
every such bill or voucher has a reference to the number of the requisi- 
tion authorizing the expenditure. Applications for leaves of absence 
are filed in this office, and a record is kept of those granted, also of all 
matters pertaining to the personnel of the Museum, except applications 
for employment, which, after receiving proper action, are filed in the 
office of the Secretary. Ai)plications for the use of the lecture hall and 
the stereopticon are also duly recorded. The files of the office contain 
letters on all subjects pertaining to administrative and financial mat- 
ters. Letters and documents of all kinds are given a distinctive num- 
ber, and the letters are carefully indexed under the name of the writer 
and the subject, the card system being used. When two or more let- 
ters relate to one subject, they are given the same number and are filed 
together. It is intended eventually to enter upon the card catalogue 
all letters contained m the press-copy books, as well as those received 
and filed. One series of press-copy books contains letters relating to 
general Museum business, another contains letters pertaining to the 
})ersonnel of the Museum, and in still another series are copied letters 
addressed to the Secretary, transmitting vouchers for payment. There 
is in this office, also, a record of all legislative matters relating to the 
Museum, and complete sets of books of estimates, digests of laws, etc. 

DIVISION OF CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS. 

This branch of the administrative work remains under the charge of 
Mr. R. I. Geare. The force is practically the same as last year, 
although the occasions upon which it has been necessary to call upon 
this office for assistance in matters outside of its own work have beeu 
much more numerous than in any previous year. There has been an 
increase of over 1,000 in the number of letters and other official i^apers 
prepared for signature, compared with the preceding year. 

A special feature of the correspondence has been in the direction of 
obtaining accessions to the library of the National Museum. Special 
circular letters were prepared and invitations extended to the State 
universities, agricultural colleges, and experiment stations, as well as 
to a number of foreign institutions and S(;ientific societies, to exchange 
publications with the Museum or to complete partial sets already in 
the library. The result of the correspondence has beeu very grati- 
fying. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 95 

Circulars have been prepared for transmission to specialists receiving 
the Museum publications requesting tbem to send their own writings 
ill exchange, and at the same time inquiring whether our sendings are 
regularly received, whether they are properly directed, and whether 
the continuance of their transmission is desired. This information 
will be of value in revising the mailing lists. It lias been thought 
inadvisable to distribute the circular until it shall be determined 
beyond doubt what number of individuals and institutions can with 
certainty be retained upon the lists. This can not be definitely settled 
until it shall be seen whether Congress is willing to remove the restric- 
tion imposed in the printing act of January 12, 1895, limiting the 
edition of the Proceedings and Bulletiu to 1,000 copies, or one-third of 
the customary number. 

Among the numerous records kept in this division, those of greatest 
importance in connection with the work of theofiQce are as follows: 

Two card catalogues showing the course of letters received at the 
Museum — one, of letters coming to the Museum direct or by reference 
from some other department or bureau of the Government; the other, 
of letters referred to the Museum ])y the Smithsonian Institution. For 
the more important letters received from the Institution, a separate 
register is kept by numbers. 

In connection with the press-copying of official papers there are ten 
separate classes of books in constant use, besides several groups of 
books containing the correspondence relating to expositions, congresses, 
and other public functions in which the Museum has participated. In 
addition to the index which each book contains, a general index in the 
form of a card catalogue is kept. On each card or group of cards is 
summarized the entire correspondence with each individual or institu- 
tion. This catalogue, which is estimated to contain at least 35,000 
cards, is one of the most valuable records of the office. On it the names 
of corresi)ondents, as well as of persons whose names occur in the cor- 
respondence, are arranged alphabetically. A supplementary catalogue 
of the names and addresses of foreign correspondents, arranged geo- 
graphically, is also preserved. 

A separate record is kept of the acknowledgments of material 
accjuired by the Museum, of reports upon objects sent to the Museum 
for identification, and of the transmission of material to institutions 
and to individuals for purposes of study; and, in addition, a record of 
the-transmission of material to specialists for determination, as well as 
of exchanges with museums in foreign countries and with individuals. 
The results of cooperation with the Museum in special directions, ou 
the i^art of the Executive Dej^artinents and bureaus of the Government, 
are also recorded. 

The accession catalogue contains the name and address of each 
contributor, together with a detailed statement of the nature of the 
material received, and other useful information, such as the date of 
entry, the number assigned, etc. The record of material sent to the 



96 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Museum for examination and report is similar in scope. These records 
are published each year in the Annual Report. During the present 
ye-'r a separate record has been kept of material received for exhibition 
at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta. 

The correspondence with educational institutions regarding the dis- 
tribution of collections forms the subject of a special catalogue. The 
cards in this catalogue are arranged alphabetically by States and sub- 
alphabetically by cities and towns. A short abstract is given of the 
contents of each communication received from applicants for collec 
tions, and also of each letter sent out from the Museum. All applica- 
tions for specimens are also entered in chronological order upon a 
separate register. 

The records relating to the distribution of Museum publications are 
quite voluminous. The mailing lists are classified as follows: (1) the 
list of domestic and foreign libraries which receive the Museum 
Reports, Proceedings, and Bulletins (embracing about 2,300 names); 
(2) tlie list of foreign correspondents receiving the Museum Report 
(embracing about 2,000 names), and (3) the lists of individuals and insti- 
tutions receiving publications upon one or more special sitbjects 
(embracing in all about 3,000 names). Card catalogues corresponding 
to these lists are preserved. Upon the catalogues corresponding to 
the first two is recorded, in convenient form, information regarding 
the relations of the Museum with the libraries and institutions listed. 
The lists referred to under the third heading consist of the names of 
the recipients of the Reports, Proceedings volumes, and Bulletins, and 
of separate papers from the Proceedings and Re]>orts; also of the 
names of specialists receiving papers upon one or more of a variety of 
subjects. Each list has its corresponding card catalogue. A separate 
record is kept showing to which lists each publication of the Museum 
has been distributed. In the case of publications sent in compliance 
with individual requests, the orders are copied in press-copy books 
kept for that purpose. 

Typewritten lists of the papers published in the Proceedings, 
arranged (1) by serial number, (2) alphabetically under the name of 
the author, and (3) according to subject matter, have been prepared, 
and are of great importance in responding to the requests of appli- 
cants for papers on various subjects. A separate list has also been 
prepared referring under (1) name of author, (2) subject, and (3) 
locality to all zoological, ])a]eontological, botanical, geological, and 
anthropological papers ])ublished by the Smithsonian Institution and 
its various branches. This is found very useful in connection with 
the Museum correspondence. 

All letters relating to Museum matters, with the exception of those 
bearing upon the finances and personnel of the Museum, are filed in 
this office, A series of special files, arranged separately, is also kept 
(i) for letters received from the various departments and bureaus of 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 97 

t\n\ Govevmiient, (2) for letters received from officials of the Museum, 
(o) tor re])orts of the scientitic and administrative oCticers of tiie 
Museum, (4) for cross-references to letters from institutions and estai)- 
lishments, (5) for letters relating to explorations in the results of which 
the Museum expects to participate, 

IJy means of card catalogues are also recorded refereuces to all let- 
ters containing unaccepted offers to present, deposit, exchange, or sell 
si)ecimens to the Museum. This record has beeu found very useful 
in supplying mforuuition to curators who may at any future time 
be desirous of obtaining material which for some reason could not be 
accepted at the time it was offered. 

Jjistyibution of puhUcations. — The transmissions of publications to 
applicants making special request by letter have surpassed in number 
those of any preceding year, and it is safe to say that the regular and 
special sendings have aggregated upward of 35,000 publications, 
including volumes and sei)arate pai)ers. 

Much attention has been given to the revision of the mailing lists, 
llecordof the date of publication of each volume and pamphlet issued 
has beeu maintained, and is of frequent service for reference, as is also 
the catalogue record of lists of specialists to whom publications have 
been mailed. 

By direction of the Secretary of the Institution, a copy of each pub- 
lication, as soon as issued, is mailed to publishing houses representing 
the Institution as agents in London, Paris, Berlin, Leipsic, and Milan. 

The innovations mentioned in the report for the preceding fiscal 
year, especially regarding the distribution of publications «lirect from 
this office, have proved satisfactory. The regular distributions to the 
persons on the permanent lists are still nmde from the document room. 
The special sendings forwarded from this office are recorded on sli^is 
printed for the purpose, with the name of the ijerson or institution 
supplied, the address, the serial number of the publication, and the 
date of mailing. When the sending comprises both Smithsonian and 
Museum publications, the package is transmitted from the Smithsonian 
building, and a slip is filled out similarly to the above, with the addi- 
tion of the name of the person upon wdiose recommendation the send- 
ing is made. These slips are press-copied in books reserved exclusively 
for this purpose, and constitute a permanent record. 

More than 4,000 labels have been written in connection with the 
distribution of the Smithsonian allotment of the Museum Reports for 
1801 and 1892 to institutions in the United States and abroad. 

The Museum Report for 1892, Bulletin 48, and Circulars 43, 44, 45, 
and 46 were issued during the year. Proceedings ]>apers Xos. 981-1031 
were distributed in pamphlet form, and also advance sheets of Nos. 1040 
and 1041.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



REGISTKATION AND DISTRIIUTION. 



The data eouccrniiig these blanches of tlie administrative work are 
taken from the report of the registrar, Mr. S. C. Brown. 

There were received during the year 30,311 packages of all kinds, 
inclnding material for addition to the collections, i)nblications, and snj)- 
plies. These figures, as compared with those for the preceding year, 
show a decrease of about 19,000. This decrease is readily accounted 
for, however, when it is remembered that during the fiscal year 1893-04 
the material returned from the World's Columbian Exposition was 
received and entered. There were 2,791 packages sent out, of which 
094 contained s])ecimens transmitted to educational establishments as 
gifts, or sent to individuals or institutions in exchange, or for study. 
A few specimens returned to owners are also included in this number. 
The entries made on the incoming transportation record numbered 
2,004, and on the outgoing transportation record, 719. 

The number of accessions or lots of material received was 1,22^, an 
increase of 02 over the record for the preceding year. There were 407 
"temporary" accessions, consisting of material received for identifica- 
tion. An increase of over 12,000 is noted in the number of specimens 
distributed, the total for the year having been 39,230. 

The storage record shows that 354 packages were placed in storage, 
while 113 packages were withdrawn by the curators to whose depart- 
ments the material belonged. The storage rooms having become very 
mucli crowded, it was found necessary to make arrangements for addi- 
tional space, and in June, 1895, new quarters were secured, containing 
more than double the floor space and three times the cubic capacity of 
the quarters previously occupied. 

Of the collections transmitted to educational establishments during 
the year, a large proportion consisted of marine invertebrates, altUough 
many specimens of rocks and ores, and casts of prehistoric implements 
have been sent out, as well as a limited number of minerals and fishes. 
Lists of the si)ecimens contained in the collections which have been 
prepared for distribution since 1890 are printed in Ajipendix ix. 

A detailed statement, arranged geographically, showing to what indi- 
viduals and institutions specimens have been sent during the year, 
either in exchange, as gifts, or for study, is given in Appendix x. The 
number of lots of specimens sent out is here recorded:

The thanks of the National Museum are due to Messrs. (leorge 
Christall c^' Co., ageuts of the Trinidad Lineof Steamers, for courtesies 
extended in offering' to transport collecting- outfits and specimens to 
and from Trinidad free of charge. 

BUILDINGS AND LABOR: POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT. 

The superintendent of buildings, Mr. Henry Horan, mentions in his 
annual report the more important features of the work accomplished 
during the year by the force under his charge. An abstract of tliis 
portion of his report is given in Appendix xi. Mr. Horan has also 
submitted a statement showing the number of cases, fixtures, etc., 
made, altered, or repaired, the amount of fuel, gas, and ice consumed, 
a list of articles lost and found in the Museum halls, lists of the tools 
in use in the various shops, and a table showing the number of feet of 
telephone and other electric wire installed. 

WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS. 

TA.VIDEKMISTS. 

Mr. William Palmer, chief taxidermist, reports that the following 
mammals were mounted during* the year, but owing to pressure of other 
work were not en-tirely finished : A Texas hare, a marsh hare, an Angora 



100 



EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



goat, a Japanese goat, two guinea pigs, and a few other small inaminaiS. 
A limited number of mounted si)ecimeus, includiug tlie head of a water 
buffalo, a paugoliu, a Hying squirrel, and a mole rat, were repaired and 
put on new stands. 

All mammals dying from the effects of confinement at the National 
Zoological Park are now received by the taxidermist and by him turned 
over to the osteological preparator or to the department of birds, rep-

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRET AKY. 101 

Mr. William Palmer spent a portiou of the months of February aiul 
March iu making- collections in the Kissimmee Kiver region of Florida. 

A model of the Tower of Babel was prepared by Mr. Joseph Palmer 
for exhibition at the Atlanta Exposition in connection with the exhibit 
of the de[)artment of oriental antiquities undcrthe direction of Dr. Cyrus 
Adler. He was also occupied in assisting in the preparation of lay 
figures and of exhibits of reptiles and birds. 

Casts were made of a collection of 318 Assyrian seals, transmitted 
by Dr. Frederick Stearns, of Detroit, Mich. A large number of casts 
of cetaceans were cleaned and repaired, and the contents of the rooms 
in the basement of the Smithsonian building in whu-h the molds are 
stored, were thoroughly overhauled. All of the tanks and pickled 
skins were removed from the shed near the Fish Conmiission building 
to one of the sheds south of the Smithsonian building. The location 
of the quarters rented for storage j^urposes and for workrooms was 
changed uear the close of the year. 

Mr. J. M. Stowell, of the Leland Stanford Junior University, and 
Mv. McElroy, of Washington, spent several weeks in the shops of the 
taxidermists, studying the methods of work. 

Mr. Henry Marshall taxidermist of the department of birds, cleaned 
and renovated about 4,000 specimens in the exhibition vseries during 
the year. He also skinned 225 alcoholic birds and dismounted about 
150 specimens. Forty-two fresh specimens were skinned and about 
50 specimens were mounted for the exhibition series. 

OSTEOLOGIST. 

The osteological work has consisted mainly in the preparation of 
material for the study series. Although a number of specimens have 
been prejiared for exhibitiou, it has been impossible, owing to pressure 
of other work, to mouut more than a small portion of them. The work of 
preparing a restoration of a skeleton of Zeuglodon for the Cotton States 
and International Exposition at Atlanta interfered greatly with the 
regular work of the osteologist. Three mouths of the time of Mr. J. W. 
Scollick were spent in developing portions of the skeleton on which the 
restoration was based. 

Eight hundred and eighty-one skulls were cleaned for the depart- 
ment of mammals, and a considerable amount of time was spent iu pre- 
paring specimens for the use of Professor Cope in connection with the 
preparation of a work on the reptilia of iSTorth America.

]\Ir. T. W. Smillie, photographer, reports that 759 negatives were 
made during the year, also 2127 platinum prints, 1,231 silver jnints, 25 
cyanotype prints, 10 bromide enlargements, and 6 lantern slides. 
Twenty-nine prints were mounted. A large portion of this work was 
done for the departments of ethnology, prehistoric anthropology, 
botany, mammals, geology, and marine invertebrates. The care of the 
photographic collection and other work of a miscellaneous character, 
including the testing of a number of different kinds of ink, in order to 
determine the most suitable for the use of the IMuseum, occupied con- 
siderable time. 



COLORIST. 



Mr. A. Zeno Sliindler continued the work of cleaning and restoring 
some o( the pictures contained in the Catlin collection of Indian paint- 
ings. About one hundred of these have received attention up to the 
present time. He also continued his work on the series of ])aintings 
representing the races of man. Some miscellaneous work was accom- 
plished, including the painting of lay figures for the department of 
ethnology, and the retouching of a series of i)hotographs of L'embroke

In this paper the genus Gnathodon, which, 
hitherto, has lield a very uncertain place in 
systematic clas.sification, is placed by the au- 
thor in the Mactridse, on account of the char- 
acters of both the shel) and the soft parts, and 
it is shown that the young shell is essentially 
raactroid. The synonymy of the species, 
notes, and descriptions are given.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



DALL, William Healey — Continued. 

I. A revision of the classiiication of the 
MactridsB of the eastern coast of the United 
States, with an enumeration of the species. 

II. This paper contains a complete revision 
of the Mactridai of the west coast of Kortli 
America, south to Panama, with an enumera- 
tion of the species. 

Notes on the Miocene and Pliocene 

of Gay Head, Martha's Vineyard, Massa- 
chusetts, and on the ' ' Land Phosphate " 
of the Ashley River district, South 
Carolina. 

Am. Journ. Sci., XLVill, Oct., 1894, pp. 
297-301. 
This paper enumerates for the first time the 
fossils of the Miocene beds of Marthas Vine- 
yard, and describes two new species. The 
Pliocene is recognized in the beds above the 
Miocene and a list of the species found in it is 
given. It is shown that the Ashley marls of 
South Carolina and the pbosphatic rock which 
overlies them are probably Miocene and not 
Eocene in age, as hitherto supposed. A list of 
species from the phosphate rock is given, 
which includes the characteristic Miocene 
type Ec2>hora quadricostata.

Notes on the shells collected. 

B^ill. Mus. Comp. Zool., xxv. No. 9, Oct., 
1894, pp. 113-124, with plate. 
This paper consists of a set of notes on a 
small lot of material sent to the Smithsonian 
Institution some years ago by Dr. J. J. Brown, 
of Sheboygan, Wis., from "Watling Island, 
Bahamas; another small lot from the same 
place, collected by the U. S. Fish Commission, 
and a third lot collected by Dr. Alexander 
Agassiz. The lagoon species are pecuHarly 
thin, small in size, and, when colored, quite 
brilliant. Notes are given on 12 juarine and 
Ifi land species and varieties, of wliicli 5 are 
new. The genus Oerion (formerly called Stro- 
phia) is divided into subgenera founded on 
characters of the internal laniinaj.

ner "Free Institutoof Science, ni, 1890, p. 58. Mr. 
Dall shows that in those Gastropods which 
have plicate apertures the adductor muscle, 
which is attached to the columella, is placed 
deeper within the shell than in the non-plicate 
forms ; that in such cases the body of the ani- 
Tual covered with its mantle is compressed as 
it is being drawn into the shell and therefore 
longitudinal wrinkles are formed in themantle. 
The secreting surfaces deposit shelly material, 
which, in the folds, takes the form of ridges in 
the aperture of the shell. 

A new Chiton from California.

A new classification of the Pelecypoda. 

Trans. Wagner Free Inst. Sci., lu, pt. ni, 
Mar., 1895, pp. 483-570. 
The author in 1889, in a "Catalogue of the 
.shell-bearing mollusks of the southeastern 
United States, " proposed a new clas.siflcation 
of the Pelecypoda. This paper is an amplifi- 
cation of that work, bringing it down to the 
present date, but conforming to the general 
principles on which the eai'lier classification 
was founded. In this system the shell, the 
anatomy, the embryology, and evidence from 
all sources are considered and made use of. A 
brief dissertation on the shell, anatomy, and 
functions of the Pelecypoda is given. Then 
follows an enumeration of the orders, subor- 
ders, superfamilies, and families of the Pele- 
cypoda, each of which is differentially defined 
in a manner enabling a direct comparison to 
be made between groups of the same rank. 
Under each family is given its range in geo 
logical time and a list of the principal genera 
believed to be referable to it. Some notes on 
the principles of nomenclature applied in the 
work and an index to the genera are appended. 
The importance of this paper lies in the revi- 
sion of the diagnostic characters, which are 
endeavored to bo made strictly comparable in 
the different groups, and when common to a 
larger group are not repeated in the definitions 
of its subordinate divisions ; and in the bring- 
ing up to date of the data employed.

In opposition to Dr. Howard Ayers, it is 
claimed that the genera Lexiidosirfn and Pro- 
toptcrus are perfectly distinct, anJ that species 
confounded under Bdcllostoma are not only 
specifically but generically distinct, constitut- 
ing the genera Heptatrcma and Polistotrema.

Proc. V. S. Nat. JIf its., xvii, No. 991, July 

19, 1894, pp. 115-116. 

The family name Prociliida?. is substituted 

for Cyprinodontes and the reasons therefor 

given; the synonyms of Poeciliidaj and Pce- 

ciliinaj are added.

The salmoniform fishes with simple ovaries 
are divided into the families Salmonida? and 
Thymallida^ ; the former is subdivided into the 
subfamilies Salmoninse, Coregoninic, and Sto- 
nodontinix'. Diagnoses of all are given. The 
genera are also enumerated with their syno-

The history of the nomenclature of the pike- 
perches is given, and the retention of Stizoste- 
dion, instead of iwcio^^erca, justified. A synop- 
sis is also given of all the species. The sup-

and characteristics of the Lampreys. 

Proc. U. S. Nat. AIus., xvn. No. 989, July 
23, 1894, pp. 107-110. 
Ammoca'tes is suppressed as a generic name, 
and shown to bo a stage common to all arcto 
g.x'an lampreys. Petromyzon and Lamjietra 
are named as the longest established genera 
and their synonyms enumerated. The families 
Mordaciidai and Petromyzonidaj are defined 
and justified. 

An Australasian subfamily of fresh 

water Atheriuoid iishes. 

Am. Naturalist, xxvin. No. 332, Aug. 14,

The genus Nem.atocentris should be called b'^ 
the prior name Mclanotcenia, iind the genus 
Aristeus of Castelnau (not Duvernoy) is re- 
named Rhombatractus. Both belong to a fresh- 
water Australasian subfamily newly named 
Melauotreniinfp, and are closelj' related.

liangia the proi)er name of the Mac- 

troid genus Gnathodon. 

Nautilus, vni, No. 9, Jan. 1, 1895, pp. 102- 
103. 
The name Onathodon had been used in ich- 
thyology earlier than conchology, and con- 
sequently its use is precluded in the latter 
department. Therefore the name Rangia, gen- 
erally used by recent conchologists, should be 
retained. 

The genus Leptophidium [renamed 

Lepophidium] . 

Am. NaturallH, xxix, No. 338, Feb., 1895, 

pp. 167-168. 

The name Lepttoplddium was used by Hal- 

lowell in I860, and consequently ippfo^'^'i'rfM'm 

of Gill (1863) should receive another name; 

Lepophidium is proposed. 

Pithecanthropus ercctns. 

Nation, LX, Feb. 7, 1895, p. 105. 
The genus Pithecanthroiius is claimed to be 
undistinguishable, so far as the characters 
have been given, from Homo, and certainly no 
characters have been adduced to justify family 
differentiation. 

The Geoffroy Saint Hilaires and Bory 

de Saint Vincent. 

Nation, LX, Feb. 21, 1895, p. 145. 
The proper names are Geofl'roy and Bory, not 
Saint Hilairo or Saint Vincent, as had been 
recently given.

On the Torpedoes. 

Science (New series), I, No. 18, May 3, 1895, 
pp. 502-503. 
It was shown that the name Torpedo was 
first applied (by Forskal in 1775) as a generic 
term to the electric catfish of the Nile, subse- 
quently called Malapterurus, and that for the 
Torpedo rays Blainville's name, Narcobatus, 
must be revived. 

The genera of Branchiostomidse. 

Am. Naturalist, xxix. No. 341, May, 1895, 
pp. 457-459. 
The family of Branchiostomidae has five 
genera successively named Branchiostoma, 
Epigonichthyi, Asymetron, Paraiiiphioxus, and 
Amphioxides. Amphioxides is a new name 
proposed for Branchiostotna pelagicum. The 
term Actiiiomimes is proposed for the so-called 
rays of tlie Branchiostomids and the so-c.dled 
ventral fins are designated the Sympodium.

Vertebrates," is given. Five genera aud 8 
species of Branchiostomids are recognized, and 
the specific characters generally used are crit-

to a distinct genus, which should be called 
Neoceratodus. The ancient forms referred to 
the former belong to at least two genera, Cera-

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



MASON, Otis Tufton — Contiuued. 

The object of this paper is to study the man- 
ufacture, the ethnographic, and the geographic 
distribution of all the types of bows, arrows, 
and quivers among the North American tribes. 
The plan lias been to treat these objects as 
specimens of natural history, and to consider 
their structure, function, and distribution on 
the line of environment and of evolution or 
elaboration, in a series of explanatory pages. 
Each separate piece is described as minutely 
as possible, so as to render the specimens in 
question types for future investigation.

cold-hammered sheets of copper and then en- 
graved with totems. 

Historic and ethnologic science.

The object of this paper is to show that the 
two lines of study, the historic and the ethno 
logic, are indispensable one to the other for in- 
vestigating the progress of human culture. 

Similar inventions in areas wide 

apart. 

Science (New series), 1, 1895, pp. 235-236. 
This paper calls attention to the wide dis- 
persion of a weaving frame or harness consist- 
ing of a series of slats, each one pierced in the 
middle. The warp threads pass alternately 
between the slats and through the holes, and 
this enables the weaver to shift the warp The 
question is raised whether the Pueblo Indians 
invented this apparatus or received it from the 
Europeans. 

The distribution of sledges. 

This article calls attention to the factthat no 
sledge, snowshoe, or goggle has ever been dis- 
covered in South America.

The author describes in detail the phases of 
the granitic disintegration, and gives analyses 
of fresh and disintegrated material. The dis- 
integration 18 shown to have taken place since 
Cretaceous times, and to be accompanied by a 
comparatively small amount of decomposition. 
The theory is advanced that the disintegration 
is due mainly to hydration.

The figure of "The American Dipper" is 
by Dr. Shufehlt, being a copy of the one given 
by Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway in their "His- 
tory of North American Birds." A brief de- 
scription of the bird, its nest, and its habits 
are given, and the author's former opinion as 
to its aflinities are restated, to the effect that 
in so far as anatomical structure seems to indi- 
cate, the nearest American ally of Oinclus is 
the Oven bird {Siurus).

described the breeding habits of this owl (Strix 
pratincola), but that this has been very fully 
done by more recent writers. Gives instances 
of their breeding in burrows in the ground, and 
also the case cited by Bendire from the account 
of Mr. Emerson, of Hay wards, Cal., where a 
pair of these owls laid twenty-four eggs on the 
tin roof of a house, where, completely unpro- 
tected, they spoiled. An excellent and reduced 
copy of Brehm's figure of this bird is presented.

An adverse view of the work of a now no- 
torious swindler in his traffic with museums 
and collectors of the eggs of birds, especially 
those of North America. The book is full of 
errors, and apparently was written to give 
scientific coloring to the unprincipled dealings

On the osteology of Cranes, Rails, etc. 

pp. 1, 2, Aug., 1894. 

Keprinted from Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., Mar. 
20, 1894, pp. 250-251. 

This is simply a brief abstract from the au- 
thor's original MSS. giving an account of tlie 
osteology and affinities of this group of birds. 
It is based upon a study of the material in his 
priv.ite collection and also that of the U. S. 
National Museum. 

A scheme of classification is presented that 
divides the suborder PaludicoliB primarily into 
two superfamilies, viz : the Gruoidea and tlie 
Kalloidea. The first named contains the fam- 
ily Gruid;c, represented by the genus Gr^is; 
and the family Aramidas by Aramus. Tbe 
Ralloidea, with the single family Eallidse, is 
made to contain the genera Jtallus, Crex, For- 
zana, lonornis, GalUnula, and Fulica. 

Giants among Woodpeckers. 

Great Divide, x. No. 8, Aug., 1894, p. 189. 
One figure in text. 
A brief account of the Ivory-billed "Wood 
pecker, calling attention to tlie fact that by 
the misinformed the Pileated Woodpecker is 
frequently mistaken for the Ivory-billed, in 
those parts of the country where both species 
occur together. A good copy of Brehm's fig- 
ure of the bird illustrates this article. 

The introduction of birds. 

Great Divide, xi. No. 8, Denver, Colo., 
Aug., 1894, p. 189. One figure in text. 
Gives a brief and popular account of many 
of the birds tliat Jiave been introduced into tho 
United States from foreign countries, and in- 
vites especial attention to the introduction of 
the Capercally, of wliich species a figure of 
the cock and hen illustrates tbe article. Mount- 
ed specimens of this bird are to be found iu the 
exhibition series of the Museum, and these 
were made use of in describing the appearance 
of the two sexes. 

Notes on some western animals. 

Great Divide, xi, No. 9, Chicago, Sept., 
1894, pp. 218-219. 
Makes brief reference to quite a number of 
western manim.als and birds, describing their 
habits and geographical range. Figures are 
given of the Round-tailed Muskrat (A'eo/ffeer 
Alleni), after True's drawing in the Proceed- 
ings U. S. N.itional Museum ; of the Wood- 
chuck (A. monax) ; and of the Canada Porcu- 
pine {E d. dursatus).

Presents a sclieme of classification for tlie 
Sul>or(ler Steganopodes, based upon a study of 
the osteological material representing that 
group in the author's collection, and in the 
collections of the II. S. National Museum. 
The article is but an abstract from original 
MSS. 

Reference is also made in this article to such 
specimens of fossil eggs of birds as have come 
to the notice of the author, as those in the 
collection of the U. S. National Museum, and 
also those described by M. Alp. Milne-Edwards 
and others.

This paper is an extensive and illustrated 
abstract from the author's unpublished MSS. 
It is based upon the osteological material in the 
collections of the U. S. National Museum, and 
in his private cabinet, and such otlier material 
as has been lent by the British. Museum and 
British naturalists. A history of the various 
proposed classifications of the grouji (Paludi- 
colce) is presented ; also a synopsis of the osteo- 
logical characters of liallus, Aramus, and Gntg 
is given. Figures of the lateral views of the 
skulls of a Rallus, of Aramus giganteus, and 
of a Grus are also given. 

Deep-sea fishes. 

Great Divide, xi. No. 10, Chicago, Oct., 
1894, pp. 240-241. Five figures in text. 
A popular account of deep-sea fishing in 
various parts of the world, with descriptions 
of many deep-sea forms. Keferences are made 
To the publications upon this subject by the 
V. S. National Museum, and to the work 
accomplished by the U. S. Fish Commission 
and by British Naturalists in the Indi.an 
Ocean. The Torch-fish (iwiop/irj/ne lucifer) is 
figured, as are also five of the deep-sea fishes of 
India (after Alcock) viz: Neohythites steatiti- 
cus, Odontostomus atratus, Bathypercis jila- 
tyrhynchus, and Physiculus argyropastus. 

The seventeen-year Cicada and some 

of its allies. 

Popular Kcicnce News, xxvni. No. 10, New 
York, Oct., 1894, pp. 154-155, with fig 
ures. 
A somewhat extended account of the nat 
ural history of the Cicadid^e based upon per- 
sonal observations of the author, upon the col- 
lections in the Department of Entomology in the 
U. S. National Museum, and the writings of 
Eiley, Packard, Kirby, and others. Numerous 
figures are given of Cicada septendeciiti, C. 
firuinosa, and Thopha saccata of Australia. 



SHUFELDT, Robert W.— Continued, 
Figures of the eggs and metamorphoses of 
these insects are also presented, together with 
a drawing of the twig of a tree showing the 
peculiar puncturing done by Cicadas. 

On the affinities of the Stegano- 
podes : A correction. 

Proc. Zool. Sac. London, Nov. 6, 1894, p. 608. 
Makes a correction in the taxonomic sf'heme 
proposed by the author for the Steganopodes 
in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society 
for 1894, p. 160. As corrected, the author is of 
the opinion that the suborder Steganopodes is 
divisible into three superfamilies, viz, the 
Pelecanoidea, the Phaothontoidea, and the Fre- 
gatoidea. In the first snperfamily arc arrayed 
thofamiliesPelecanida3,Phalacrocoracid», An- 
hingidiT', and Sulida' ; in the second, thePhae- 
thontidic ; and in the last the Fregatida;. 

Pelicans. 

Popular Science News, xxvin. No. 11, New 
York, Nov., 1894, pp. 165-166. One fig- 
ure. 
This is a brief account of the natural history 
of several species of Pelicans and their allies 
in various parts of the world. Reference is 
also made to the mythical legends about the.se 
birds, and to such fossil Pelicans as have been 
described by the author and others. The arti- 
cle is illustrated by a good figure of the Brown 
Pelican drawn by Dr. Shufeldt from the large 
painting of that species by Audubon. 

King snakes. 

Observer, v. No. 11, Portland, Conn., Nov., 
1894, pp. 328-329. One figure. 

Contains brief references to the various spe- 
cies of King Snakes ( Oiihibolus) of the United 
States, as represented in the collections of the 
U. S. National Museum, and described in its 
publications. 

A figure of a young king snake, Ophibolus 
g. getulus is given. (From a photograph by 
the author; natural size.) 

The photography of birds. 

Great Divide, xi. No. 11, Chicago, Nov., 
1894, pp. 263-26^. Three figures. 
Good photographs of living specimens of 
wild and domestic animals of all kinds, as 
well a9 the various structures they build for 
their habitation and the rearing of their 
young, have proved of verj- great servict; to 
naturalists, taxidermists, and many others. In 
the present contribution Dr. Shufeldt deals 
with the subject of the photography of birds, 
tlie methods employed, and some of tlic many 
difficulties to be overcome. Half-tone figures 
of living specimens of the Scree<'h Owl (Mega 
scops), the Great Horned Owl (Bubo), and 
Gambel's Partridge (Calipepla) illustrate the 
article. The last named was taken at the 
U. S. National Museum.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



SHUFELDT, Robert W.— Continued. 

Three talf-tone figures illustrate this article, 
being reproductions of photographs of the 
Common White Stork of Europe ( Ciconia alba). 
The most interesting one of these gives a 
Stork in full flight the moment it quits its 
nest, while the other two show them in differ- 
ent attitudes. Brief i)opular accounts are 
given of various species of storks found in 
different parts of the world, and several 
legends in regard to some of them are also 
referred to. 

(Jrebes. 

Popular Science News, Xix, No. 1, New 
York, Jan., 1895, pp. 3-4. 
This is a popular account of the birds called 
Grebes, and their allies, based upon the au- 
thor's extended scientific work in the group, 
in which latter the collections of the U. S. 
National Museum have been very extensively 
used. It gives the classification and relation- 
ships of the Pygopodes, and makes constant 
reference to those occurring in the United 
States and elsewhere, as well as the probable 
origin of the Loons and Grebes in time. Of 
this it is pointed out that they are the descend- 
ants of a now extinct ancestral stock of birds, 
from which those remarkable fossil forms of 
toothed divers of the Cretaceous beds of Kansas, 
described by Marsh— the Hesperornithidae— 
were an offshoot. The article is illustrated by 
a half-tone of the author, and figures of the 
Horned Grebe, drawn by Dr. Shufeldt after 
Audubon. 

[Letter to Editor. Reply to Pro- 
fessor Coo.] 

Popular Science News, xxix, No. 1, New 
York, Jan., 1895, p. 7. 
Sustains the opinion of Dr. Giinther, of the 
British Museum, in that the Rattlesnake 
(Crotalus) is incapable of sounding its rattle 
when from any reason the interspaces between 
the several individual rattles are filled with 
water. This fact has been noted at the Zoolog- 
ical Gardens of London in the case of these 
reptiles. Professor Coe holds a contrary opin- 
ion, based upon personal observation and ex- 
periments with rattles taken from the snakes. 

The Loons. 

Popular Science News, xxix, No. 2, New 
York, Feb., 1895, pp. 17-18. One figure 
in text. 
A popular description of the Loons of the 
United States, their habits, plumage, .and geo- 
graphical ranges, much of the information 
being derived from the specimens contained 
in the collections of the U. S. National Museum. 
Reference is made to the rarity of the Black- 
throated Diver in the latter, of which species 
there are no skins in the collection, and only a 
few mounted examples. 

A figure of TTrinator arcticus is given, drawn 
from one of these specimens. 



SHUFELDT, Robert W. Beauty from 
an Indian's point of view. 

Cosmopolitan, viii, No. 5, New York, Mar., 
1895, pp. 591-598. Nine figures in text. 

In this contribution the question of the esti- 
mation of female beauty in several of the tribes 
of North American Indians is dealt with. 
Descriptions, comparisons, and the reproduc- 
tions from ihotographs of a number of women 
considered to be belles in the several tribes to 
which chey belong are given. Among the.se 
are to be noted selections from the Lagunas, 
the Navajoes, the Zufiians, the Apaches, the 
Tumas, the Moquis, and the Mojaves. 

To these descriptions (anatomical, anthro- 
pological, and otherwise), are added accounts 
of the various kinds of diess and trinkets worn 
by these women as a matter of personal adorn- 
ment. 

Auks and their allies. 

Popular Science News, xxix. No. 3, New 
York, Mar., 1895, pp. 33-34, with figures. 

A great many of the skins and mounted 
specimens, as well as all the osteological mate- 
rial representing this group of birds in the col- 
lections of the U. S. National Museum, have 
been extensively studied by the author. Much 
of this has already been published, while stiU 
more remains in MSS. It is upon this that 
the present popular article is based. The arti- 
cle is illustrated with drawings by Dr. Shufeldt, 
such as the Whiskered Auklet (after Ridgway), 
and the Great Auk. The latter was loaned by 
the Century Company, the original having 
appeared in The Century Magazine, where it 
illustrated another article by the author (Jan., 
1886). 

On a method of modeling certain 

invertebrata for museum exhibition. 

Journ. Institute Jamaica , xi. No. 2, Kings- 
ton, Jamaica, Apr., 1895, pp. 170-172. 

Presents a fairly complete account of the 
methods employed at the U. S. National Mu- 
seum to preserve and mount various forms of 
invertebrates, both marine and terrestrial. The 
modeling of an Octopus is given as an example, 
and the material used in making gelatin casts 
is likewise described, and its formula pre- 
sented. 

Reference is also made to the mode of pre- 
paring models from zoological figures and pho- 
tographs of the specimens. 

Some Fort Wingate reminiscences. 

New Mexico. 

Nidologist, n. No. 8, New York, Apr., 
1895, pp. 102-105. Two plates. 

In 1888-89 the author was stationed, as post 
surgeon, at Fort Wingate, N. Mex., and during 
the latter part of this period he passed through 
the ordeal of a military court-martial, one of the 
most famous in the history of this country. It 
practically tested the question as to whether 
or not an officer on duty could avail himself of 
his spare time for the purpose of scientific 
investigation.

SHUFELDT, Robert W.— Continued. 

A varied collection was made afWlngate by 
Dr. Shufeldt for the U. S. National Museum, 
but the most of his time was given over to the 
publication of his researches, the whole repre- 
senting several volumes. A portion of tliis was 
jiublished by the Museum, while the major 
])iirt of it appeared in London. A fine plate of 
tlie "Navajo church," as well as one of the 
author's study at Wingate, illustrates the con- 
tribution. 

Some of tlie "Outliers" among 

lnn]s. 

Popular Science Monthly, xi.vi, No. 6, New 
York, Apr., 1895, pp. 760-780. Ten fig- 
ures in text. 
Numerous types of birds still puzzle avian 
taxonomers, and no unanimity of opinion yet 
exists as to their atiinities. Examples of the.se 
may be seen in such forms as the Sun Bittern 
(Eiirypyga) and others. 

In the present article nearly all of these 
puzzling species are described and figured, and 
the various opinions held by ornithologists 
upon their kinships are given in greater or 
less detail. In his studies of these "outlying 
types" Dr. Shui'oldt made very extensive use 
of the collections of the IT. S. National Mu- 
seum.

May 25, pp. 488-490, with six figures in 
text. 
Popular articles based upon the author's well- 
known report upon " Scientific Taxidermy for 
Museums," published by the U. S. National 
Museum. The half-tones illustrating these 
articles were made by the American Field Pub- 
lishing Company direct from the original pho- 
tographs taken at the Museum, and they con- 
stitute a very useful series of zoological figures. 

Gulls and their allies. 

Popular Science News, xxix, No. 5, New 
York, May, 1895, pp. 65-66, with figures. 
Partly scientific in character, this popular 
account is based upon the author's studies of 
all the osteological and other material in the 
collections of the U. S. National Museum, and 
his private cabinet, illustrating the group of 
birds known as the Longipennes and their 
allies. The major portion of these researches 
are in MSS. and ready for publication, with 
numerous original figures. 

The present article is illustrated by a good 
electro cut of Ross's Gull (adult male and young 
female), redrawn by the author from J. H. 
Ridgway's colored plates in the Keport of the 
International Polar Expedition to Point Bar- 
row, Alaska, by Lieut. P. H. Raj, U. S. A.

In general, a very favorable notice of tlie 
work, the principal exceptions being tliat its 
author is taken to task I'or not employing the 
n etric system for the purposes of measure- 
ment; and secondly, that he perpetuates some 
very antiquated notions in regard to the clas- 
sification of some of the groups of birds. For 
example, Mr. Chapman retains the Flamingoes 
in an order by themselves, and yet places the 
American Vultures (CathartidaO as n family 
in the order Raptores, in total disregard of 
what is now known of the structure of these 
several fonns.

1895, pp. 104-105, with figures. 
Contains more or less full descriptions of the 
"dead-leaf butterflies" of Java (Kallima para- 
lekta) and its peculiar habits, and also the re- 
lated .species K. inachis, the first named being 
figured. Brief accounts are given also of sev- 
eral South American forms, as Dynastor napo- 
leon, Euptychia tricolor, Perisarna euriclea, and 
others. The species last mentioned are fig- 
ured, as well as Leptocireus curious. Reference 
is made b^ the author to some of the Amer- 
ican butterflies collected by him in New Or- 
leans and now forming a part of the Museum 
collection. 

[Review of] The pterylography of 

certain American Goatsuckers and 
Owls. By Hubert Lyman Clark. Proc. 
U. S. Nat. Mus., XVII, 1894, pp. 551-572, 
tigs. 1-11. 

Nidoloyist, 11, No. 10, New York, June 1895. 

A favorable notice of a brief but none the 
less important contribution to the jiterylogra- 
phy of North American birds. 

After a careful study of the pteryloses of a 
sufficient number of Owls and Goatsuckers, 
Mr Clark naturally comes to the conclusion 
"that the Caprimulgi are rel.ated to Striges, 
and not very distantly either— probably a 
branch from the early part of the Strigino 
stem," an opinion in which his reviewer moat 
fully concurs. 

Lectures on biology. 

pp. i-in, 1-102. 
Reprinted from the American Field, XLI, No,

These are the biological lectures given in 
full, as they were delivered at the Catholic Uni- 
versity of America by Dr. Shufeldt (together 
with a historical preface), during the moutli 
of January, 1892. The entire field of l)iology 
is reviewed with greater or less thorough- 
ness, and as many biological laws contlict 
with the dogmas entertained by the Church of

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



SHUFELDT, Robert W.— Contimied. 

Rome, these lectures met with very marked 
disfavor from such quarters. Through the 
operation of Catholic influence it was found 
impossihle for the author to print them, either 
in Europe or America, until two years after 
their delivery, and the reasons therefor are set 
forth in the preface. Kot a few references are 
made to the work accomplished by the U. S. 
National Museum and to its collections. 

[Article on the Mocking Bird.] 

Dictionarii of Jiirdn. By Alfred Newton, 
assisted by Hans Gadow. with contri- 
butions i'rom Richard Lydekker, B. A., 
F. R. S., Charles S. Roy, M. A., F. R. S., 
and Robert W. Shufeldt, M. D. (late 
U. S. Army). Pt in. London, 1894, 
pp. 582-585. 
A life history of Mimus polyglottus, oontrib- 
nted to Newton's Dictionary of Birds, and one 
that has been very favorably spoken of by not a 
few British ornithologists, notwithstandingthe 
fact thatits author 8ay 8 : " To compare him with 
his only rival, the European Nightingale, seems 
to me quite out of place, though I will say 
that my faith in the powers of the Mocking- 
bird is so firm, that I believe were he success- 
fully introduced into those countries where 
the Nightingale flourishes, that princely per- 
former might some day wince as he was obliged 
to listen to his own most powerful strains 
poured forth with all their native purity by 
this king of feathered mockers, the subject 
of the present notice." 

SIMPSON, Charles Torrey. Types of 
Anodonta dejecta rediscovered. 

Navtilus, vni. No. 5, Sept., 1894, pp. 52-53. 
The types of Anodunta dejecta, Lewis, which 
were in the National Museum collection, were 
rediscovered by the writer in examining some 
duplicate material, and prove to be the same as 
his A. Mcarnsiana from the Pacific drainage. 
The locality, "head of Arkansas River," given 
for Lewis's types is no doubt erroneous. 

Patella (Helcioniscus) nigrisqua- 

niata, Rve. 

Nautilus, vni, No. 8, Dec, 1894, pp. 91-92. 

The writer shows that the shell named 

Patella honinensis by Pilsbry is only an adult 

form of P. nigris'juamata, named long ago by 

Reeve. 

Distribution of the land and fresh- 
water mollusks of the West Indian 
region and their evidence with regard 
to past changes of land and sea. 

Proc. TJ. S. Kat. AIus., xvii, No. 1011, Jan. 
26, 1895, pp. 425-450, pi. xvi, figs. 1-8. 
In this paper some account is given of the 
means of distribution of land and freshwater 
snails. The theory is advanced that the land- 
snail fauna of the Greater Antilles is ancient 
and has developed on the islands, which for- 
merly were more elevated and united together 



SIMPSON, Charles Torrey— Cont'd, 

as well as to Middle America, and, by way of 
the Bahamas, to South Florida; that a subsid- 
ence separated the islands from each other 
and from Middle America, leaving only the 
summits of the mountains above the sea, and 
that they have since, during a period of uplift- 
ing, reached their present elevation ; that the 
land-snail faunaof theLesser Antillesis closely 
related to that of South America, and that 
there is no evidence that the Lesser Antilles 
have ever been united to the Greater Antilles. 
These deductions are drawn largely from bio- 
logical evidence. 

Note on Unio oregoncnsis, Lea. 

Nautilus, vni. No. 10, Feb., 1895, pji. 116- 
118. 
The four type specimens of U. oretjonensis, 
Lea are the only ones known, and the writer, 
in carefuUj' comparing tliem with other species, 
discovered that they were identical with the 
forms which Lea had named Unio Poirclli and 
Unio McNeili from Central America. The 
locality of U. oregoncnsis (Oregon) is undoubt- 
edly erroneous. 

Unio ochracexs and U. cariosns. 

Nautilus, vin. No. 11, Mar., 1895, pp. 1'21- 

123. Two woodcuts. 

In this jiapor an attempt is made to point out 

the dili'erences between the closely related 

U. eariosus and U. ochraceus, and to show that 

both are valid species.

The introduction (pjj. 1-13) discusses the 
systematic position of the group and its com. 
ponciits. Thoy are divided into three tribes: 
Helliini, Hermiini, and Hyphenini, and a syn- 
opsis of the 19 genera is given (pp. 13-14). 
The genera Pseudorgyia and Rivula are 
excluded from the Deltoids. The ni.ain part of 
the work (pp. 15-118) gives complete descrip- 
tions of the genera and species, with full syn- 
onymy, synoptic tables, and geographical 
distribution. Seventy-three species are recog- 
nized as valid (listed on pp. 119-120), of which 
eight are described as new. Pis. i-ix give 
excellent photo engravings of all species, and

This paper describes early objects of primi- 
tive industry found in Europe, and compares 
them with those found in America. Dr. Ab- 
hott'sflnds of similar implements in t!ie gravels 
of the river terrace at Trenton, N. J., are com- 
pared with the infructuous searches of other 
persons in the same terrace. It is shown that, 
by reason of the scarcity of the implements, 



WILSON, Thomas— Continued. 

the failure of an observer to find them in one 
locality is no evidence that another observer 
may not have found them in another locality. 
Similar experiences of tho best observers iu 
France and England are cited. Many imple- 
ments of similar form and manufacture luive 
been found in nearly every State of the Union, 
though practically all on the surface. This 
does not, however, prove the existence of 
Paleolithic man in America, but, as says ^f. 
Boule, is "an argument iu favor of their an- 
tiquity which will greatly impress prehistoric 
archsologists of experience.'' It will servo a 
good purpose in stimulating further investiga- 
tion, and prevent the formation of conclusions 
before the search has been exhausted and the 
evidence all in. 

Polished stone hatchets. 

Archceologist, ill, No. 1, Jan., 1895, pj). 8-14 ; 
No. 2, Feb., 1895, pp. 43-50. 
The polished stone hatchet is, more than any 
other implement, the representative of man's 
culture during the Neolithic or Polished Stone 
age. !Man in this stage spread himself by 
migration practically over the whole world, 
and in so doing earned with him this imple- 
ment more than any other. While tlie Paleo- 
lithic age of prehistoric man is called the 
chipped stone age, the chipping of stone- 
cutting implements did not cease with it, but 
was to some extent carried into the Neolithic 
or Pohslied Stone age. Some implements thus 
chipped were ground to a sharp edge or point, 
while others were left unground. The tools 
used were hammer stones and grindingstones. 
The processes are shown m six figures forming 
a series, from tho rudely chipped to the finely 
polished hatchets. In the Paleolithic ago the 
material u.sed was such as could be chipped, 
while m tlie Neolithic age many stone imple- 
ments of nonchipable material, like granite, 
diorite, etc., were used These had to be re- 
duced to the required form by hammering or 
pecking, called by the French martelage. The 
hatchet was inserted in a handle of wood, 
with the cutting edge on a line with the han- 
dle. Many specimens, mo.stly from France and 
England, have been found, which indicate this 
as the general method of use. The National 
Museum is tho fortunate possessor of two 
original specimens thus mounted, one tho 
property of Mr. Byron E. Dodge, of Wisconsin, 
and the other of Mr. CM. Grouse, of Sj'racnse, 
N. Y. The universality of the polished stone 
hatchet during the Neolithic period is sliown 
by the universality of the material used. On 
the seacoast and the islands fossil shells 
were not infrequently employed. While no 
two polished stone hatchets may be exactly 
alike, each having been the handiwork of an 
individual who anparently worked for himself 
and without pattern, they are all capable of 
being reduced to a few general types, and a 
series taken from almost any locality in the 
United States would represent a similar series

from almost any other locality in tlie same 
country, and would closely resemble a series 
from any part of the world. 

On the presence of Huorino as a test 

for the fossilizatiou of animal bones. 
Am. Naturalist, xxix. No. 340, Apr. 1895, 

pp. 301-317; No. 341, May, 1895, pp. 

439-456. 
It is greatly to bo desired that some test 
should be discovered bj- which the antiquity 
of animal, and especially human, bones might 
be determined. This test is believed to have 
been found in fluorine. It may not be certain 
nor always equal, but if it furnishes, or prom- 
ises to furnish, an aid in this direction, it is to 
be studied, examined, experimented with, and 
l)roved. Modern animal bones have but a 
small percentage of fluorine, less than two- 
tenths of 1 per cent, while it appears to increase 
in quantity and proportion until in those of 
the earlier geologic ages the proportion reaches 
3 and even 4 per cent. Thi.s increase may bo 
different in different localities, but from analy- 
ses of a large number of specimens it seems a 
steadily increasing ratio, and therefore aft'ords 
a means of approximate determination. 

Grooved stone axes. 

Arcliceologist, hi, No. 5, May, 1895, pp. 

155-157. 

While the polished stone hatchet was almost 

universal among prehistoric peoples, the 

grooved stone ax is confined to the United 

States. 

When the prehistoric man of Europe desired 
a heavier cutting implement than his polished 
stone hatchet, he drilled a hole through the ax 
and inserted a handle, sledgo fashion. When 



WILSON, Thomas— Continued. 

the prehistoric man of America wanted a simi- 
lar implement, he made a groove around the 
implement and bound it with a withe, which 
served as a handle. 

Some of these implements have the edge 
placed transversely to the handle and so they 
become adzes, and where the edge is curved 
instead of straight they become gouges. Tlio 
same difterence of detail in size, .shape, form, 
and material remarked among polished stone 
hatchets have been found among grooved 
stone axes. 

Stone cutting implements. 

Archceolngist, HI, No. 6, June, 1895, pp. 
179-185. 
Rude notched axes resemble tlie grooved ax. 
A notch has been i)repared by chipping for a 
withe or handle, the edges of which notch have 
been hammered or pecked so as to destroy 
their sharpness and permit the use of the 
withe, but they are rudely chipi^ed. and beyond 
this show no traces of pecking and never of 
smoothing or grinding. Thej' are peculiar in 
their shape and can not have been grooved 
stone axes in process of manufacture, though 
they may have been its evolutionary ancestor. 
They are always made of material which can 
be chipped — like flint, quartzite, rhyolite.etc. — 
and seem never to have been made of nou- 
chipable material, as granite, diorite, etc. 
They are found in many localities throughout 
the United States.

APPENDIX IX. 

Lists of Ditplioate Spp^cimens Prepared for Distribution 
TO Educational Establishments since 1890.' 

Within the past five years collections of minerals, fishes, casts of 
prehistoric implements, rocks and ores, and marine invertebrates have 
been distribnted among a limited number of educational establish- 
ments in the United States. Although numerous applications from 
high schools and the smaller colleges have been received, it has been 
found necessary, as a rule, to decline compliance. It is hoped, how- 
ever, that before many years the Museum will be enabled to separate the 
duplicate material m all of its departments and make it up into sets. 
When this has been done, it will doubtless be possible to extend the 
scope of distribution so as to include those grades which have not 
hitherto been supplied.

PALEOLITHIC AGE, EUKOPE. 

Drift period (Sir John Lubbock, Mr. John Evan.sj- 
Cave Bear jieriod (Lartet); Clielleeu epoch (de 
Mortillet) ; Alluvium (Solomon Reinach). 

The.se implements are the earlie.st known to 
have been made by man. They are distributed 
in almost every quarter of the globe. They are 
found on the surface on hills and high tablelands, 
but mostly in the gravels of the river valleys, 
and conse(]uently are believed to be of the same 
age. They are found associated with the i-emains 
of the extinct fauna of the Quaternary period 
and were contemporaneoiLs therewith. The char- 
acteristic of the industry of this age is, that all 
the .stone impU'ments were made by chipping or 
flaking. Man knew not that rubbing one stone 
against another would sharpen or polish it.

PALEOLITHIC AGE, UNITED STATES. 

Implements similar in form, style, and mode of 
manufacturo to those from other countries have 
been found in the United States, and they s(^em to 
indicate a similar stage of culture, though tho 
contemporaneity of neithp.r the implements nor 
the stages of culture to which they belonged 
has yet been established so as to be universally 
accejited ; nor has the relationship of tlie men 



who made or used them on the two hemispheres 
been established. Yet the fact is undoubted that 
the implemenls are i)ractically the same. These 
implements have been found to the number of 
several hundred by Dr. Abbott in the gravels of 
the Delaware River, as they were washed from 
the glacial terminal moraine and deposited at 
Trenton, N. J. ; by Miss Franc E. Babbitt, in the 
gravels of one of the terraces of the Mississippi 
River, at Little Falls, Minn.; by Dr. C. L. Metz, 
in the gravels of tho Little Miami River at Love- 
land, Ohio; by Dr. Hilborne T. Cresson, at White 
River, Indiana, and in the Columbia gravels of 
the railway cuts south of Chester, Pa. The asso- 
ciation and condition of these finds would seem 
to establish the anti(juity of man's occupation in 
this country, and its contemporaneity with tho 
glacial epoch at least on the Atlantic Coast. Sim- 
ilar implemenls have been discovered on the sur- 
face in almost every State. ("A Study of Prehis-

speciiuens show an intentional worked depresaioii 
in the center of one or both sides, and in sonic 
instances this cavity is so well defined that it is 
dillicult to draw the line between hammers and 
cup-stones. Some large and heavy specimens 
show a groove, as do the axes, which served for 
an attachment of a handle. These are called 
mauls. Other classes of hammers are the flint 
pebbles peculiar to Flint Kidge, Muskingum 
County, Ohio, and those from the Pacific Coast-

GlIOOVED STONE AXES. 

These are characteristic implements of aborigi- 
nal Indian industry in tho United States, and 
their distribution i-t general. They are peculiar 
to this country, and do not belong to Europe. 
Almost tho only prehistoric grooved stone imide- 
meuts found there are mauls used in mining or 
quarrying. The material in the United States 
difl'ers with tho locality ; but granite, trap, and 
rocks which would not tiake were used. Grooved 
axes are made of water-worn pebbles as well as of 
quarried rock. They Avere chipped and pecked 
into shape and then smoothed or })olished by 
rubbing or grinding. Some were not polished 
but only peeked. The handle was attached by 
means of a withe or thong passing around in the 
groove. Grooved axes may be divided according 
to form, but there are no sharp divisions between 
the classes. Peculiar ibrms are to be noted, of 
hematite from the Mississippi Valley, or of 
actinolite from the pueblos of tlie Southwest. 
(Handbook, p. 647, fig. 22.) 

These have been classified as follows : 
I. Grooved, either wholly or partially, some 
with projecting wings. 

IT. Flat back for insertion of tightening wedge. 

III. Douldc-bitted. 

IV. Hematite. 

V. Actinolite from the pueblos of the South- 
west.

rOLISHEU STONE HATfJUETS. 

These, frequently called "Celts," and erro- 
neously "Fleshers' and " Skin-dressers," in the 
United States, and "Thunder" or "Lightning" 
stones in the Eastern Hemisphere, were possibly 
intended for use similar to the grooved axes ; and 
the same remarks as to material, locality, and 
mode of manufacture apply to one as to the other. 
Although these vary greatly in form and size, yet 
they were i)ractically for the same use. They 
were inserted in their handles as shown by No. 
11479, which, though of stone, is like many 
others of wood. These are the representative 
implements of the Neolithic or Polished Stone 
Age, and are found throughout the prehistoric 
world. On the coast ar.d islands they are often 
made of shell. (Handbook, p. 645, fig. 20.)

COPPER IMPLEMENTS AND ORNAMENTS. 

The North American Indians, although living 
in the age of Polished Stone, made use of native 
copper. It was chiefly obtained from tlie Lake 
Superior region. Aboriginal mining has been 
described by Mr. Charles Whittlesey in Smith- 
sonian Contributions, Vol. xill. Native copper 
has been found in New England, New Jersey, and 
the mountains of Virginia and the Caroliiias. It 
is generally believed that the Indians did not 
smelt or cast copper, but hammered their imi)le- 
nients out of nuggets ; yet it is possible that some 
races or tribes had the knowledge of casting. The 
implements of copper were principally hatchets, 
knives, and spearheads, hut there are elaborate 
ornaments. (Handbook, pp. 666-667, fig. 40.)

These are similar to the polished stone hatchets 
in matei-ial, mode of manufacture, and in every 
way except their gouge form. They were prob- 
ably handled aiul used in the same manner. They 
are more plentiful in, if not conlined to, the 
Atlantic States. Tho.seof the southern coast and 
the West Indies are of shell. They occur in

These are, apparently, only a variation in form 
and use from the polished stone hatcliet and 
gouge. They are more rare. Tlieir distribution 
in the United States seems to be limited to the 
northeast Atlantic ai:d the northwest Pacific 
coasts, but they have been found in other parts of 
the prehistoric world. Tlieir mode of liafting is

PERFORATORS. 

This name has been given to a class of chipped 
objects which indicate by their form a possibility 
of being used as such. There is hardly enough 
evidence, however, in their appearance to war- 
rant this conclusion. Many of the points are 
slightly broken, and in a few instances the edges 
are smoothed; but nearly all are in their original 
condition and show no signs of use. A member 
of the Sioux Indian delegation at Washington, in 
January, 1890, pronounced many of them to be 
ornaments worn suspended from the neck. A 
Mohawk Indian declared them to he amulets or 
charms. (Handbook, p. 643, flg. 18.)

SCRAPERS. 

Thick flakes of flint, obsidian, etc., worked at 
one extremity to a convex edge. They were in- 
serted in a handle and used fur scraping any needed 



substance, but principally for dressing skins. Oc- 
casional specimens are found with a stem and 
barb, resembling in that regard certain arrow and

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1S95. 



MORTARS AND PESTLES. 

These implwnents were iq common iiae by the 
aborigines tbrougbout the Tiiited States. Nearlj- 
every material -was utilized for mortars, but 
stone was usual. One has been found in Cali- 
fornia niado of a fossil wbale vertebra. Those 
of wood are not infrequent. The metate of 
Mexico is similar in purpose. Tliese objects are 
important in this, that while they have continued 
in ii.se within the knowledge of persons still liv 
iug, they have been found in the auriferous grav- 
els of C'alifornia at such depth and with such 
associations as to be assigned to the Quaternary, 
or even Tertiary, geologic period. If this be 
true, they are the earliest known smoothed stone 
implements made or used by man. Mortars are 
not exhibited in this collection. (Handbook, pji.

DRILLED TABLETS. 

These objects, which form a numerous class, 
are of various shapes and careful finish, pierced 
with one, two, or more lioles. They are u.snally 
made of slate, but other material was used. Dif- 
ferent purposes have been ascribed to them, 
but nothing certain is known. They may have 
been pendants, amulets, or badges of distinction. 
They are never brought to a cutting edge, and, 
except in rare cases, show no signs of use. They 
have been found on the breasts of skeletons of 
antiquity in the United States. (Handbook, 
p. 650, fig. 24.)

INSCRIBED TABLETS. 

These are extremely rare and are j)rincipally 
found in mounds. Their inscriptions have never 
been read, and the pretended translations are not 
approved by students of prehistoric archa'olosy. 
A number of tablets have been reported of which 
some are without doubt genuine, but tliomajority 
are believed, or are contended to be, frauds. The 
presumption would be against any newly found 
tablet, and its genuineness must bo established. 
The best known tablets believed or accepted as 
genuine are the Cincinnati Tablet (S. I. Contri- 
butions to Knowledge, Yol. i, p. 274 et seq.) ; 
Davenport Tablet, Short ("North American,Indi- 
ans of Antiquity," p. 38, et seq.) ; Grave Creek' 
Tablet, McLean ("The Mound Builders," p. 91, 
et seq). 

Inscribed Tablet. — Fine-grained sand- 
stone of a light-brown color.

SINKERS, PENDANTS, OR CHARMS. 

This series shows various, though notall, kinds 
of the objects. These are made of hematite or 
hard stone, and are flnelj- poli.shed . Some sinkers 
not shown are smooth, flat, shore jiebbles, broken 
on the edge so as f o easily take and hold the line. 
One has a hole in the top by which a line can be 
attached ; others have a groove, though very 
slight; while some have neither groove nor hole. 
Objects similar to these have been found with a 
truncated butt. Their distribution throughout 
the interior in greater numbers than on the lake 
or sea shores adds to the difficulty of their clas- 
sification and a knowledge of their ])urpo8e.

SPADE-SHAPED IMPLEMENTS. 

Tliese might be classed with the ceremonial 
objects, as no practical use has been suggested 
lor them. Their rarity and restricted locality 
would seem to indicate a purpose more ceremonial 
than otherwise. Less than a dozen are repre- 
sented in the collection of the U. S. National 
Museum, the majority coming from Tennessee; 
northern Georgia and northeastern Arkansas 
furnishing one specimen each. They are always 
polished, and the spade portion is never brought 
to a shari> cutting edge. The material of which 
they are made is always compact, iine-grained 
stone, greenstone, chlorite, lydite, etc. (Hand- 
book, p. 657, tig. 26.)

CEKEMONIAL OBJECTS. 

The purpose of these objects is purely conjec- 
tural. For want of a name indicating their use they 
liave been called variously, ceremonial objects, 
banner stones, butterflies, etc. Their material is 
usually too soft and fragile to have served as 
cutting implements or weapons. They are not 
sharpened to a cutting edge, and their signs of use 
are rare, except that they are often broken. The 
hole is too small for the insertion of a handle for 
service. While some specimens are of slate and 
other sofi substances, indicating that they might 
have been ornaments, yet others are of quartz, 
jasper, syenite, and similar substances — hard, and 
dirticult to shape, polish, or drill. Some speci- 
mens show only the rude form made by hammer- 
ing and pecking; others, although finished by 
l)ulishing, are destitute of shaft holes, or merely 
show their beginnings, demonstrating the fact 
that in America (as in Europe) articles were first 
brought to the required shape and afterwards 
drilled. A large number of these objects are 
fouiul broken after being completely finished, both 
by polishing and drilling, and in some cases the 
blades or wings show perforations similar to those 
in the tablets. This indicates a secondary use, 
possiblj^ as badges or ornaments, and so they 
were considered of value, even when broken.

BIRD-SHAPED OBJECTS. 

This name is given to a class of objects some- 
what bird-like in shape, but which run impercep- 
tibly into other conventional forms, such as the 
fence lizard, turtle, etc. They generally stand 
on flat bases, pierced with a diagonal hole at each 
end where the breast and tail rise. In some 
cases the eyes are not represented; in others 
they are marked by bead-like projec'tions expand- 
ing into discs. Some specimens belonging to 
this class were evidently not intended to repre- 
sent either birds or animals, both ends being 
alike. Various theories as to their use have been

advaiieeil, knife handles, corn liuskers, etc., but 
Dono of tliese are satisfactory. One sjiocimen 
in tlio National Museum (No. 9075) from the 
Northwest coast (entirely modern) has a cord 
attached, evidently for suspension. Their use 
as charms or amulets seems tlie most probable. 
A Chippewa Indian stated that they served for 
gaming. They were placed in a flat pan or bas- 
ket which, being covered, was shaken up and 
down, then set down carefuUj-, the cover removed, 
and an inspection would show how many birds 
were seated miright. He who had the gre:itest 
number won the game. (Handbook, p. 651, tig. 25,

BOAT-SHAPED OBJECTS. 

The title indicates our want of knowledge con- 
cerning their purpose. Diflerent uses have been 
assigned to them, such as twine twisters, handles 
for carrying parcels, or for tightening cords or 
lines. A Mohawk medicine woman said they 
were "a witch's auiulet.s for her transportation 
over the water, as i.s the broomstick by the mod- 
ern witch for flight through the air. If it was 
lost, her power of flight or passage was gone." 
Some are solid, others are hollowed out, and the 
perforations may be either at the center or near 
the ends. These objects are nearly always well 
made and polished ; their material is syenite, 
though greenstone and occasionally slate were 
used, esjtecially the striped variety. A limited 
number of specimens of this class, made ot galena, 
have been found. (Handbook, p. 650, tig. 24, Noa.

TT'BES. 

In the National Museum is a number of f;tone 
tubes of cylindrical and other forms and diU'ereut 
lengths. The smaller ones, often only a few inches 
in length, have been thouglit to be ornaments. A 
variety of uses is ascribed to the larger objects, 
the most plausible being that by the medicine 
man for the jiretended curing of di.seases. Their 
use for smoking or as whistles or calls has also 
been suggested. The hole through the tube is 
sometimes the same size througliout, having been 
drilled from one end, and sometimes biconical, 
having been drilled from both ends. Another 
class has large, straight, cylindrical holes drilled 
almost the entire length of the tube and then fin 
ished with one of a small diameter. One specimen 
in the Museum collection is 13 inches long and 
terminates at one end in an expanding mouth- 
piece (No. 7243). The materials are usually ste 
atite, banded slate, and chlorite, although sped 
mens of sandstone are not wanting. (Handbook, 
p. 664, fig. 37 )

PIPES. 

No class of aboriginal prehistoric art produc- 
tions exhibits a greater variety of forms than 
pipes. They are chiefly carved from stone, but 
not unfrequently were molded in clay. A clas- 
Hifieation of pipes is impossible on account of 
their diversity of shape. For illustration and 
description of the more marked types see Hand-

or grinding. The material is usually hard, such 
as quartz, white, brown, or yellow quartzite 
(sometimes translucent), dark greenstone, etc. 
Specimens of argillite and sandstone, however, 
are not wanting. They are supposed to have been 
used by the Indians in a g.;me called "chungkee," 
described by Adair, DuPratz, Lawson, and other 
early writers, and referred toby Lewis and Clarke, 
Catlin, and writers of more recent date. They

STONE OBJECTS FROM THE AURIFEROUS 
GRAVELS OF CALIFORNIA . 

These are tho enigmas of prehistoric man in 
North America. If any reliance cau be placed in 
human testimony, we must believe that these, 
with mortars and similar objects, came from 
under the lava beds and belong to the early Quat- 
ernary, if not tho Tertiary geologic period. If 
thus found they would seem to be the earliest 
known implements made by man, and again thej' 
are of the Neolithic or Polished Stone civilization, 
and so belong to the more modern prehistoric man 
in the present geologic period. These contradic- 
tions must await tho investigations of the geolo- 
gist and paleontologist as well as the archfeologist. 
In our present knowledge it would be unwise to 
announce any hard' and fast theory.

patu-patu or MERAI. 

This is the traditional weaijon of the New 
Zealander. They may be made of wood, but usu- 
ally are of hard greenstone, the jade of that coun- 
try. They have been polished with a .species of 
corundum found in the island. They are finely 
and symmetrically made, must have required 
much labor, and are valued highly. They become 
heirlooms and are given proper names. A sword 
knot is attached either l)y a groove or hole. This 
specimen was given by J. B. Aldrich, who de- 
.scribes it bj' letter from Memphis, June 25, 1883, 
thus: "It was dug out of a mound under my 
direction in 1866, while quartermaster. United 
States Army. Themound was situated just south 
of the Arkansas River, nearthe thirty-eighth par- 
allel, in Bent County, southeastern Colorado. It 
was tho theory of Kit Carson, who accompanied 
the command, that it had been secreted there bj' 
some of the Comanche or Ajiache Indians who 
then occupied the Territory." The hole is filled 
with a remnant of the loop, made of vegetable 
fiber.

PERFORATED STONE CLUB HEADS. 

The objects forming this series in the Museum 
collection have been mostly obtained from Indian 
graves and from the surface of the Santa Barbara 
Islands and the opposite Californian coast. Their 
material is sandstone, serpentine, soapstone, etc., 
though specimens of harder material, such as 
greenstone, have been found. They vary in size 
and form, being from li to 5 inches or more in 
diameter. There are some specimens only one- 
half inch in thickness, while others are so thick 
as to equal their diameter and give them a glob- 
ular form. (Handbook, p. 655, fig. 28.)

APPENDIX XI. 

The Work of the Mechanics and Laborers. 

The following condensed statement is made up from the report sub- 
mitted by Mr. Henry lloran, superintendent of buildings, and is 
intended to indicate, in a general way, the character of the work 
performed by the members of the force connected with his department: 

1894. 

July. — A set of bookshelves was constructed at the west end of the lecture hall 
for the use of the Museum library. All of the exhibition cases in the north hall 
were thoroughly cleaned aud the woodwork repolished. The model of the Zuni 
Indian village was removed from the department of i»rehistoric anthropology to the 
Museum building. New steam coils were placed in several of the halls of the 
Museum, and the radiators in the northeast court and in the boat hall were placed 
on the top of the wall cases recently constructed. Several exhibits in the section 
of fisheries, including the deep-sea sounding apparatus, were taken down and sent to 
storage. 

Aur/ast. — Exhil)ition cases were constructed in the room on the first floor of the 
south tower of the Smithsonian building for the use of the section of physical appa- 
ratus. Repairs were made to the floor in the lecture hall. The "Quarry Group" 
was transferred from the department of ethnology to the department of prehistoric 
anthropology. The lecture hall was prepared for a meeting of the Association of 
Agricultural Chemists, held August 23-25. Workmen were engaged for several days 
in enlarging one of the chimneys in the northwest pavilion. In anticipation of the 
meeting of the Knights of Pythias in this city, and the large number of strangers 
expected, all of the cases were removed from the rotunda, in order that the crowds 
might be handled more readily. 

September. — A large radiator was placed in the paint shop, proper connections 
being made with the boiler room in the Smithsonian ))uildiug. Repairs were made 
to the boilers in the Museum building, the work being performed by contract. The 
east balcony and the adjacent offices were fitted up for the use of the National 
Herbarium. The boiler and pump rooms in the Smithsonian Ijuiiding were cleaned 
and whitewashed. Direct connections were made by telephone between the iluseum 
and the Department of Agriculture. 

October. — The door-screen cases between the piers in the northwest range were 
replaced by pier cases. Trenches were dug and steam pipes laid from the Smithso- 
nian building to the Astro-Physical Observatory. All of the steam pipes in the 
basement of the northwest pavilion were removed, and the heating apparatus in 
the upper stories of this section of the building overhauled. Repairs were made to 
the floor in the fisheries hall. The electric wires and batteries in the northwest 
pavilion were overhauled, the wires in the Assistant Secretary's office being placed 
under the floor. The work of putting the east balcony into condition for the National 
Herbarium, constructing and erecting cases, etc., was continued. Stationary book- 
cases of oak were constructed in the office of the Assistant Secretary. The large 
iron safe in the office of tlie chief clerk was set in the wall, in a space cut for the 
purpose. Ventilators were placed in the telephone room and in the offices of the 
superintendent aud property clerk. 

307 



308 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

November. — A new switchboard was placed in the telephone room, and several 
additional instruments were installed in dift'erent parts of the building. New steam 
pipes were placed in the office of the department of fishes. A large exhibition case, 
Avhich had heretofore been in the center of the northwest court, was remodeled and 
made into two wall cases, which will be set up in the section of oriental antiquities. 
Several pier cases were set up in the mineral hall, in place of the door-screen cases, 
which have been removed. 

December.— A\l oi' the cases in the department of prehistoric anthropology were 
thoroughly cleaned. The lecture hall was put in condition for the use of the Ameri- 
can Historical Society, Avhose meetings opened December 27. Considerable work 
was (lone in the southeast court, preparatory to its occupancy as the exhibition hall 
of the paleontological department. 

1895. 

January. — Work in the southeast court was continued. A number of screens were 
altered, and these and the walls Avere painted. The plaster casts and models were 
moved from the basement rooms under the north tower of the Smithsonian building. 
The exhibition cases in the dep.irtmcnt of comparative anatomy were rearranged. 
All of the oils and inflammable materials, which were formerly stored in the alcohol 
room in the basement of the Smithsonian building, were removed to other quarters. 

February. — A section of the mahogany Avail case on the north side of the exhibi- 
tion hall of the department of couiparative anatomy was removed in order to pro- 
vide an entrance to the southeast court from this side. The lire plug in the east- 
south range was removed and placed just inside the entrance to the southeast 
pavilion. The north and west basement rooms of the Smithsonian building were 
fitted up with shelves and will be used for the storage of plaster casts and molds. 
Watch boxes Avere placed in several of the outbuildings. 

March. — A telephone instrument Avas placed in the carpenter shop, and connec- 
tions made Avith the telephone room. Watch boxes Avere erected on the second floor 
of each of the four balconies of the Museum building. Two fire plugs in the east 
hall were removed and placed inside of the east entrance to the buildiug. The loca- 
tion of the fire plug in the fisheries hall Avas also changed. 

AjjrU. — A force of men Avero engaged for several days in hanging the models of 
Indian villages on the walls of the northwest court. A man was detailed from each 
of the night Avatihes for duty outside of the larger buildings, the object being to 
o-ive better protection to the sheds and outbuildings. A hose reel Avas placed just 
outside the south entrance to the Smithsonian building, the hose being kept con- 
stantly attached to the fire plug and ready for immediate use. A ladder and ax 
have also been placed Avithin easy reach, and connections Avith the telephone room 
established, so that help may be readily summoned in case of fire. 

May. — For several days a number of men Avere engaged in rearranging the cases in 
the mineral hall. Improvements Avere made in one of the rooms on the second floor 
of the Avest balcony. It is proposed to place toilet rooms in the basement and on the 
first and second floors of the south tower of the Smithsonian building. This work 
was commenced about the middle of the month. A number of long-distance tele- 
phones Avere put up by the telephone company in place of the old style of instru- 
ment formerly in use. This change necessitated additional wires, as the new 
instruments require a metallic circuit. 

June. — An additional Avatch l)ox Avas placed in the Museum carpenter shop. New 
quarters for storage purposes were rented, and the work of removing material to 
the new building occupied considerable time during the month. Door-screen cases 
Avere placed between the piers above the Avail cases in the department of compara- 
tive anatomy. The steam valves of the radiators throughout the buildings were 
examined and a portion of them repacked. The boiler rooms and coal vaults were 
thoroughly renovated and whitewashed.

THl: SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND THE SECRET SOCIETIES OF 
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 



By Franz Boas. 



PREFACE. 



The following paper describes and illustrates tlie collections of the 
U. S. Njitional Museum referring to the social organization and secret 
societies of the Indians of the coast of British Columbia. It is based 
on studies made by the author during a series of years. The great body 
of facts presented here were observed and recorded by Mr. George 
Hunt, of Fort Rupert, British Columbia, who takes deep interest in 
everything pertaining to the ethnology of the Kwakiutl Indians and to 
whom I am under great obligations. I am indebted to him also for expla- 
nations of ceremonials witnessed by myself, but the purport of which 
was difficult to understand, and for finding the Indians who were able to 
give explanations on certain points. 

My thanks are due to Mr. C. O. Hastings, of Victoria, British 
Columbia, who took a series of photographs, reproductions of which 
will be found in this report, A series of ptionographic records of 
songs belonging to the ceremonials were transcribed by Mr. John C. 
Fillmore and myself. I also had opportunity to verify many of the 
phonographic records by letting the Indians repeat the songs two years 
after the records had been taken. 

I have also to thank Prof, A, Bastian, director of the Royal Ethno- 
graphical Museum at Berlin, Sir Augustus W. Franks, keeper of the 
ethnographical department of the British Museum, Mr. Franz Heger, 
director of the ethnographical department of the Imperial Royal 
Museum of Natural History at Vienna, and Prof, F. W. Putnam, 
curator of the department of anthropology of the American Museum 
of Natural History at New York, for permission to use specimens con- 
tained in the collections of these museums for illustrating the present 
report.

I. The Indian Tribes of the North Pacific Coast. 

The Pacific Coast of America between Juan de Fuca Strait and 
Yakutat P>ay is inliabited by a great many Indian tribes distinct in 
physical characteristics and distinct in languages, but one in culture. 
Their arts and industries, their customs and beliefs, differ so much 
from those of all other Indians that they form one of the best defined 
cultural groups of our continent. 

While a hasty glance at these people and a comparison with other 
tribes emphasize the uniformity of their culture, a closer investigation 
reveals many peculiarities of individual tribes which prove that their 
culture has developed slowly and from a number of distinct centers, 
each people adding something to the culture which we observe at the 
present day. 

The region inhabited by these people is a mountainous coast inter- 
sected by innumerable sounds and fiords and studded with islands, 
large and snuill. Thus intercourse along the coast by means of canoes 
is very easy, while access to the inland is difficult on account of the 
rugged hills and the density of the woods. A few fiords cut deep into 
the mainland, and the valleys which open into them give access to the 
heart of the high ranges which se])arate the coast from the highlands 
of the interior, forming an effectual barrier between the people of the 
interior and those of the coast. These fiords and their rivers and val- 
leys offer comparatively easy access to the coast, and along these lines 
interchange of culture has taken place. Extending our view a little 
beyond the territory defined above, the passes along which the streams 
of culture flowed most easily were Columbia Kiver in the south and 
the pass leading along Salmon and Bella Coola rivers to Dean Inlet 
and Bentinck Arm. Of less importance are Chilcat Pass, Stikine 
River, Nass and Skeena rivers, and Fraser Kiver. Thus it will be seen 
that there are only two important and four less important passes, over 
which the people of the coast came into contact with those of the 
interior. Thus they have occupied a rather isolated position and have 
been able to develop a peculiar culture without suffering important 
invasions from other jiarts of America. 

As the precipitation all along the coast is very great, its lower parts 
are covered with dense forests which furnish wood for building houses, 
canoes, implements, and utensils. Among them the red cedar {Thuya 
(jigautea) is the most prominent, as it furnishes the natives with mate- 
rial for most manufactures. Its wood serves for building and carving; 
its bark is used for making clothing and ropes. The yellow cedar, pine, 
fir, hemlock, spruce, yew tree, maple, alder, are also of importance to 
the Indians. The woods abound with numerous kinds of berries, which 



318 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

are eagerly sought for. The kelp and seaweeds which grow abundantly 
all along the shore are also utilized. 

In the woods the deer, the elk, the black and grizzly bear, the wolf, 
and many other animals are found. The mountain goat lives on the 
higher ranges of the mainland. The beaver, the otter, marten, mink, 
and fur seal furnish valuable skins, which were formerly used for blan- 
kets. The Indians keep in their villages dogs which assist the hunters. 

The staple food of the Indians is, however, furnished by the sea. 
Seals, sea lions, and whales are found in considerable numbers; but the 
people depend almost entirely upon various species of salmon, the hali- 
but, and the oulachon or candleflsh {Thaleichthys pacificus, Girard), 
which are caught in enormous quantities. Various specimens of cod and 
other sea tish also furnish food. Herrings visit the coast early in spring. 
In short, there is such an abundance of animal life in the sea that the 
Indians live almost solely upon it. Besides fish, they gather various 
kinds of shellfish, sea urchins, and cuttlefish. 

The people are, therefore, essentially fishermen, all other pursuits 
being of secondary importance. Whales are pursued only by the tribes 
of the west coast of Vancouver Island. Other tribes are satisfied with 
the dead carcasses of wliales which drift ashore. Sea lions and seals 
are harpooned, the barbed harpoon point being either attached to a 
bladder or tied to the stern of the canoe. The harpoon lines are made 
of cedar bark and sinews. The meat of these sea animals is eaten, 
while their intestines are used for the manufacture of bowstrings and 
bags. Codfish and halibut are caught by means of hooks. These are 
attached to fish lines made of kelp. The hook is provided with a 
sinker, while the upper part is kept afioat by a bladder or a wooden 
buoy. Cuttlefish are used for bait. The fish are either roasted over or 
near the fire or boiled in wooden kettles by means of red-hot stones. 
Those intended for use in winter are split in strips and dried in the sun 
or over the fire. Salmon are caught in weirs and fish traps when ascend- 
ing the rivers, or by means of nets dragged between two canoes. Later 
in the season salmon are harpooned. For fishing in deeper water, a 
very long double-pointed harpoon is used. Herring and oulachon are 
caught by means of a long rake. The oulachon are tried in canoes or 
kettles filled with water, which is heated by means of red-hot stones. 
The oil is kept in bottles made of dried kelp. In winter, dried halibut 
and salmon dipped in oil is one of the principal dishes of the tribes living 
on the outer coast. Clams and mussels are collected by the women ; 
they are eaten fresh, or strung on sticks or strips of cedar bark and 
dried for winter use. Cuttlefish are caught by means of long sticks; 
sea eggs are obtained by means of round bag nets. Fish roe, particu- 
larly that of herring, is collected in great quantities, dried, and eaten 
with oil. 

Sea grass, berries, and roots are gathered by the women. The sea 
grass is cut, formed into square cakes, and dried for winter use. The 
same is done with several kinds of berries, which when used are dis- 
solved in water and eaten mixed with fish oil. Crab-apples are boiled 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 319 

and kept in their juice until late iu the winter. They are also eaten 
with fish oil. The food is kept in large boxes which are bent of cedar 
wood, the bottom being- sewed to the sides. 

In winter, deer are hunted. Formerly bows and arrows were used in 
their pursuit, but these have now been replaced by guns. The bow 
was made of yev: wood or of maple. The arrows had stone, bone, and 
copper points. Bows and arrows were carried in wooden quivers. Deer 
are also captured by being driven into large nets made of cedar bark, 
deer sinews, or nettles. Elks are hunted iu the same way. For smaller 
animals traps are used. Deer and bears are also caught in large traps. 
Birds were shot with arrows j)rovided with a thick blunt point. Deer- 
skins are worked into leather and used for various purposes, principally 
for ropes and formerly for clothing. 

The natives of this region go barelegged. The principal part of 
their clothing is the blanket, and this was made of tanned skins or 
woven of mountain-goat wool, dog's hair, feathers, or a mixture of 
both. The thread is s]nin on the bare leg and by means of a spindle. 
Another kind of blanket is made of soft cedar bark, the warp being 
tied across the weft. These blankets are trimmed with fur. At the 
present time woolen blankets are most extensively used. At festive 
occasions "button blankets" are worn. Most of these are light blue 
blankets with a red border set with mother-of-pearl buttons. Many 
are also adorned with the crest of the owner, which is cut out in red 
cloth and sewed on to the blanket. Men wear a shirt under the blanket, 
while women wear a petticoat in addition. Before the introduction of 
woolen blankets, women used to wear an apron made of cedar bark and 
a belt made of the same material. When canoeing or working on the 
beach, the women wear large water-tight hats made of basketry. In 
rainy weather a water-tight cape or poncho made of cedar bark, is 
used. 

The women dress their hair in two plaits, while the men wear it com- 
paratively short. The latter keep it back from the face by means of a 
strap of fur or cloth tied around the head. Ear and nose ornaments 
are used extensively. They are made of bone and of abalone shell. 
The women of the most northern tribes (from about Skeena Eiver north- 
ward) wear lab rets. 

A great variety of baskets are used — large wicker baskets for carry- 
ing fish and clams, cedar-bark baskets for purposes of storage. Mats 
made of cedar bark, and in the south such made of rushes, are used for 
bedding, packing, seats, dishes, covers of boxes, and similar purposes. 

In olden times work in wood was done by means of stone and bone 
implements. Trees were felled with stone axes and split by means of 
wooden or bone wedges. Boards were split out of cedar trees by means 
of these wedges. After the rough cutting was finished, the surface of 
the wood was planed with adzes, a considerable number of which were 
made of jade and serpentine bowlders, which materials are fouiul in 
several rivers. Carvings were executed with stone and shell knives. 



320 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Stone mortars and pestles were used for mashing- berries. Paint pots 
of stone, brushes, and stencils made of cedar bark formed the outfit of 
the Indian painter. Pipes were made of slate, of bone, or of wood. 

Canoes are made of cedar wood. The types of canoes vary some- 
what among the different tribes of the coast, depending also largely 
upon whether the canoe is to be used for hunting, traveling, or fishing. 
The canoe is propelled and steered by means of i)addles. 

The houses are made of wood and attain considerable dimensions. 
The details of construction vary considerably among the various tribes, 
but the general appearance is much alike from Coniox to Alaska, while 
farther south the square northern house gives way to the long house of 
the Coast Salish. A detailed description of the house will be given 
later on. 

The tribes comprising the North Pacific group speak a great many 
difierent languages. From north to south we find the following lin- 
guistic families, which are subdivided in numerous dialects, as follows: 

I. Tlingit, inhabitating southern Alaska. 

II. Haida, inhabiting (^ueen Charlotte Islands and part of Prince 
of Wales Archipelago. 

III. Tsimshian, inhabiting ISTass and Skeena rivers and the adjacent 

islands. 

1. Nisqa', on Nass River. 

2. Gyitkca'n, on upper Skeena River. 

3. Ts'E'mcian. on lower Skeena River and the adjacent islands. 

IV. Wakashan, inhabiting the coast from Gardiner Channel to Cape 

Mudge, the region around Dean Inlet excepted; Vancouver 
Island, except its southeastern part, from Comox to Sooke 
Inlet; and Cape Flattery. 

A. Kwakiutl group. 

1. Xa-isla, on Gardiner and Douglass channels. 

2. He'iltsuq, from Gardiner Channel to Rivers Inlet. 

3. Kwakiutl, from Rivers Inlet to Cape Mudge. 

B. Nootka group, inhabiting the west coast of Vancouver Island 

and Cape Flattery. 
V. Salishan, inhabiting the coast of the mainland and the eastern 
part of Vancouver Island south of Cape Mudge, the southern 
part of the interior as far east as the Selkirk Range, and the 
northern parts of Washington, Idaho, and Montana; also the 
region of Dean Inlet. 
A. The Coast Salish. 

1. Bi'lxula, on Dean Inlet and Bentinck Arm. 

2. (j)aLo'ltx, at Comox and Toba Inlet, formerly north of 

Cape Mudge. 

3. PE'uLatc, at Comox. 

4. Si'ciaL, on Jervis Inlet. 

5. Sqxo'mic, on Howe Sound and Burrard Inlet. 

6. Qau'etcin, on Cowichan River and lower Fraser River.

7. Lku'SgEn, on the soiitlieasteru part of Vancouver Island. 

This dialect is nearly identical with the S'a'inic, 
SEraia'mo, XLu'mi, and La'lam, the last of which is 
sj)oken south of Fuca Strait, while the others are 
spoken east of the Gulf of Georgia. 

8. Nsqoa'li and affiliated dialects of Pnget Sound. 

9. Twa'nuX, at Union City, Puget Sound. 

10. Sqau'elitsk, on Cowlitz River. 

11. Sa'tsEpc, on Chehalis River. 

12. Tsxe'lis, on Greys Harbor. 

13. Kwi'naiuL, north of Greys Harbor. 

14. T'ile'mukc, south of the mouth of Columbia River. 
B. Salishan languages of the interior. 

1. ISTLak-a'pamuX, on the canyon of Fraser River and the 

lower course of Thompson River. 

2. SLa'LiumX, on Douglas and Lillooet lakes. 

3. SExua'pamuX, from Ashcroft to the northern extremity 

of Okanagan Lake, the Big Bend of the Columbia, 
and Quesnelle. 

4. Okina'qen, with the closely related Kalispelm, Spokane, 

Flathead s. 
VI. Chemakum, south of Cape Flattery and near Port Townseud. 
VII. Chinook, on Columbia River. 

Among these languages, Tlingit and Haida on the one hand, Kwakiutl, 
Salishan, and Chemakum on the other, show certain similarities in form 
vhich induce me to consider these groups as more closely related among 
liemselves than to the other languages. 

The physical characteristics of the Indians of this region show also 
;hat they are by no means a homogeneous people. So far as we know 
low, we may distinguish four types on the coast of British Columbia: 
Che northern type, embracing theXisqa' and Tsimshian; the Kwakiutl 
;ype; that of Harrison Lake; and the Salish of the interior, as rep- 
resented by the Okanagan, Flathead, and Shuswap. The following 
neasurements show the differeuces of types :

322 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The types expressed by these figures may be described as follows: 
The northern Indians are of medium stature. Their arms are relatively 
long, their bodies short. The head is very large, particularly its trans- 
versal diameter. The same may be said of the face, the breadth of 
which is enormous, as it exceeds the average breadth of face of the 
North American Indian by 6 mm. The height of the face is moderate; 
therefore its form appears decidedly low. The nose is very low as 
compared to the height of the face, and at the same time broad. Its 
elevation over the face is also very slight only. The bridge is generally 
concave, and very flat between the eyes. 

The Kwakiutl are somewhat shorter, the trunks of their bodies are 
relatively longer, their arms and legs shorter than those of the first 
group. The dimensions of the head are very nearly the same, but the 
face shows a remarkably different type, which distinguishes it funda- 
mentally from the faces of all the other groups. The breadth of the 
face exceeds <»nly sliglitly the average breadth of face of the Indian, 
but its height is enormous. The same may be said of the nose, which 
is very high and relatively narrow. Its elevation is also very great. 
The nasal bones are strongly developed and form a steep sirch, their 
lower end rising high above the face. This causes a very strongly 
hooked nose to be found frequently among the Kwakiutl, which type 
of nose is almost absent in all other parts of the Pacific Coast This 
feature is so strongly marked that individuals of this group may be 
recognized with a considerable degree of certainty by the form of the 
face and of the nose alone. 

The Harrison Lake type has a very short stature. The head is 
exceedingly short and broad, surpassing in this respect all other forms 
known to exist in North America. The face is not very wide, but very 
low, thus producing a chamteprosopic form, the proportions of which 
resemble those of the Nass River face, while its dimensions are much 
smaller. In this small face we find a nose which is absolutely higher 
than that of the Nass River Indian with his huge face. It is, at the 
same time, rather narrow. Tlie lower portion of the face appears very 
small, as may be seen by subtracting the height of the nose from that 
of the face, which gives an approximate measure of the distance from 
septum to chin. 

The Salish of the interior have a stature of 168 cm. Their heads are 
shorter than those of the tribes of Northern British Columbia or of 
the Indians of the plains. Their faces have the average height of the 
Indian face, being higher than that of the northern type of Indians, 
but lower than that of the Kwakiutl. The nose is high and wide, and 
has the characteristic Indian form, which is rare in most parts of the 
coast. 

The social organization of the tribes of the coast shows considerable 
variation. The tribes of the northern parts of the coast have a mater- 
nal organization, while those in the south are purely paternally organ- 
ized. The central tribes, particularly the Kwakiutl, show a peculiar 
transitional stage. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 323 

The Tlingit, Haida, Tsimsliiaii, and Heiltsuq have animal totems. 
Tlie first of these have two phratries, the raven and wolf among the 
Tlingit, raven (Q'oa'la) and eagle (G-itEna') among the Haida. The 
Tsimshian have fonr totems — raven (Qauha'da), eagle (Laxskiyek), 
wolf (Laxk-ebo'), and bear (G-ispawaduwE'da) ; the Heiltsuq three — 
raven (Qo'ix-tenox), eagle (Wl'k'oaqx-tenox), and killer whale (Ha'lx'- 
aix'tenox); the Xa-isla' six — beaver, eagle, wolf, salmon, raven, killer 
whale. Animal totems in the pioper sense of this term are confined to 
these five groups or tribes. They are not found among the Kwakiutl, 
although they belong to the same linguistic stock to which the Xa-isla 
and Heiltsuq belong. The clans of the northern tribes bear the names 
of their respective totems and are exogamous. 

It must be clearly understood, however, that the natives do not con- 
sider themselves descendants of the totem. All my endeavors to 
obtain information regarding the supposed origin of the relation 
between man and animal have invariably led to the telling of a myth, 
in which it is stated how a certain ancestor of the clan in question 
obtained his totem. The character of these legends is uniform among 
all the peoi)les of this region ; even farther south, among the Kwakiutl 
and the northern tribes of the Coast Salish, who have no animal 
totem in the restricted sense of this term. The ideas of the Kwakiutl 
regarding these matters will be described fully later on. As these 
legends reveal the fundamental views the natives hold in regard to 
their totem, I shall give abstracts of a few of them. 

The following is a legend of the Tsimshian : 

The Bear Clan. — An Indian went mountain-goat hunting, When he 
had reached a remote mountain range, he met a black bear, who took 
him to his home, taught him how to catch salmon, and how to build 
canoes. For two years the man stayed with the bear ; then he returned 
to his own village. The people were afraid of him, because he looked 
just like a bear. One man, however, caught him and took him home. 
He could not speak and could not eat anything but raw food. Then 
they rubbed him with magic herbs, and gradually he was retransformed 
into the shape of a man. After this, whenever he was in want, he 
called his friend the bear, who came to assist him. In winter when 
the rivers were frozen, he alone was able to catch salmon. He built a 
house and painted the bear on the house front. His sister made a 
dancing blanket, the design of which represented a bear. Therefore 
the descendants of his sisters use the bear for their crest. 

It is evident that legends of this character correspond almost exactly 
to the tales of the actpiisition of mauitows among the Eastern Indians, 
and they are evidence that the totem of this group of tribes is, in the 
main, the hereditary manitow of a family. This analogy becomes still 
clearer when we consider that each man among these tribes acquires a 
guardian spirit, but that lie can acquire only such as belong to his clan. 
Thus, a person may have the general crest of his clan and, besides, use 
as his personal crest such guardian spirits as he lias ac(| aired. This 
accounts partly for the great multiplicity of combinations of crests 
which we observe on the carvings of these people. 



324 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The more general the use of the crest in the whole clan, the remoter 
the time to which the clan lei^end is ascribed. In many cases the inci- 
dents are considered C()nii)aratively recent, and are then conhned to the 
descendants of the person whom th6 legend concerns. The extreme case 
is the narrative of acquisition of one of the crests of the clan by a single 
person. 

These ideas necessitate that we find the clans or phratries subdivided 
and that there exists a multiplicity of crests for each phratry. As an 
illustration of this phenomenon, I will give a list of the crests and clans 
of the Stikine tribe of the Tliiigit: 

Crests of the raven phratry: Haven, frog, goose, sea lion, owl, salmon, 
beaver, codfish, skate. 

Crests of the woif phratry: Wolf, bear, eagle, killer whale, shark, 
auk, gull, sparrow hawk, thunder bird. 
Tlie phratries of the Stikine tribes are subdivided as follows: 
Families of the raven phratry : 
Qasx'ague'de. Crest: Raven. 
K-iks'a'de. Crest: Frog. 
Qatc'a'de. Crest: Raven. 

Tir hit tan (=bark house clan). Ciest: Beaver. 
DeLqoe'de (=people of the point). Crest: tlaveu. 
Qagan hit tan (=sun house clan). Crest: Raven. 
xeLqoan. Crest: Beaver. 
Families of the wolf phratry: 

Nanaa/ri or sikuax'a'de (corresponding to the Kagouta'u of other 
Tlingit tribes), subdivided as follows: 
Hara'c hit tan (=porch house clan). 
Tos hit tan (==shark house clan). 
Q'et go hit tan. 

xuts hit tan (=bear house clan). 
XOqe'de. Crest: Killer whale. 
The list is probably not complete, but it shows the character of these 
subdivisions. Similar subdivisions, although less numerous, are found 
among the Tsimshian. 

The crest is used for ornamenting objects belonging to a member of 
the clan; they are carved on columns intended to perpetuate the mem- 
ory of a deceased relative, painted on the house front or carved on a 
column which is placed in front of the house, and are also shown as 
masks in festivals of the clan. It is impossible to draw a sharp line 
between the pure crest and figures or masks illustrating certain inci- 
dents in the legendary history of the clan. In order to illustrate this 
point, which is of great importance in the study of our subject, I will 
describe a few examples observed among the Nisqa' Indians. 

The G'ispawaduwE'da, the bear clan of the Nisqa', use a headdress 
representing the owl (maskutgunu'ks) (Plate 1), surrounded by many 
small human heads called gyad Em Laqs (claw men). This is worn in 
potlaches, and commemorates the following tradition : 

A chief at T'Emlax'a'mt had a son who was crying all the time. His 
father became impatient and sent him out of the house, saying, '' The

white owl shall fetch you." The boy went out, ac(;ompaiiied by his sis- 
ter. Then the owl came and carried the girl to the top of a tree. The 
people heard her crying, and tried to take her down; but they were 
unable to climb the tree. After a while she ceased to cry, and married 
the owl. They liad a son. When he grew up, slie told lier husband 
that slie desired to send her son home. Then the owl made a song for 
him. His motlier told him to carve a headdress in the shape o*f an 
owl for use in his dance, and to sing the song which his father had 
made for him. She bade him farewell, telling him that her husband— the 
owl— was about to carry her to a far-off country. The owl carried both 
of them to the old chief's house. When the wife of the latter saw the 
unknown boy, she was afraid ; but her daughter reassured her, and told 
her that the boy was her grandson. Then the old woman took him into 
her house, while the owl and the boy's mother disappeared. When the 
boy was grown up, his mother's brother gave a festival, and before pres 
ents were distributed among the guests the boy danced, wearing the 
owl headdress and singing the following song which his father had com- 
posed for him :

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



When tlie G*itx'q'ad(Vq branch of the Qanha'da have a festival, three 
masks make their appearance, one of which has a mnstache and rep- 
resents a young man named G-itgo6'yim (l*late 2, upper figure), while 
the other two are called Ca'ca (Plate 2, lower figures). They represent 
the following tradition : 

While the people were staying at the fishing village Gulg*e'uL, the 
boys, under the leadership of a young man named G-itgoo'yim, made a 
small house in the woods behind the town. They took a spring salmon 
along and played with it until it was rotten. They caught small fish 
in the creek and split and dried them. They made small drums and 
began to sing and to dance. For four days they stayed there, dancing 
all the time. Then they became superna>tural beings. Gdtgoo'yim's 
hair had turned into crystal and copper. The people were about to 
move to another camp and went to fetch the boys, whom they heard 
singing:

That is : Where the copper hair, where the ice hair is siDread out, is

As soon as the people approached them they disappeared and were 
seen at once dancing and singing at a distant jjlace. The i)eople were 
unable to reach them. Then they returned, and since that time the 
G'itx*q'ad6'q have used the song and dance of these boys. 

As an example of the use of the crest, viz., of the legend of the clans 
in the erection of memorial columns, I will give the following: A man 
had the squid for his protector. After his death his son gave a festival, 
in the course of which the ground opened and a huge rock which was 
covered with kelp came uyj. This was made of wood and of bark. A 
cave was under the rock and a large squid came out of it. It was made 
of cedar bark and its arms w^ere set with hooks which caught the blan- 
kets of the audience and tore them. The song of the squid was snug- 
by women who were sitting on three platforms in the rear of tlie house: 

Qagaba'xskE laxha' hayai, qagaba'xskE laxha' hayju.

After the squid and the rock had disappeared again, a man wearing 
the sun mask appeared in the door, and when the people began to sing 
his song, a movable suu which was attached to the mask began to turn. 
The sun belongs to the G'ispawaduwE'da; the squid commemorates the 
misfortunes of one of the ancestors of the deceased, who, when hunting 
squids at ebb tide, was captured by a huge animal. His friends tried 
to liberate him, but were unable to do so. When the water began to 
rise, they pulled a bag of sea-lion guts over his head, hoping that the 
air in it might enable him to survive, but when they looked for him at 
the next tide they found him dead. 

After the festival a memorial column was erected. It represented, 
from below upward, first four men called Loayo'qs, or the commander.s. 
These are a crest of the G-ispawaduwE'da. Tradition says that one 
night some men for some purpose dug a hole behind a house near a 
grave tree. They saw an opening in the woods and a fire in the middle 
of it, around which ghosts were dancing. They were sitting there as 
though they were in a house, but the men saw only a pole where the 
door of the house would have been. Four men called LOayo'qs were 
standing at the door, and called to them nagwi't! (to this side). Since 
that time the G-ispawaduwE'da have used these figures. 

On top of the four men was the sea bear (mEdT'ek Em ak's) with three 
fins on its back. Each fiu has a human face at its base. The tradition 
of the sea bear tells how four brothers went down Skeena River and 
were taken to the bottom of the vsea by Hagula'q, a sea monster, over 
whose house they had anchored. His house had a number of platforms- 
Inside were the killer whales, Hagula'q's men. He had four kettles 
called Lukewarm, Warm, Hot, Boiling, and a hat in the shape of a sea 
monster, with a number of rings on top. Tlie name of his house was 
Helaha/idEq (near the Haida country). He gave the brothers the right 
to use all these objects and with them their songs, which are sung at all 
the great ceremonies of the clan. The song of the house is as follows:

II. The Social Organization of the Kwakiutl. 

The -Kwakiutl are divided into a great many tribes, which are in 
their turn subdivided into septs and clans. Each clan of the Kwakiutl 
proper derives its origin from a mythical ancestor who descended from 
heaven, arose from the under world, or emerged from out of the ocean. 
Their crests and privileges, which will be discussed later on, are based 
upon the adventures of their ancestors, from whom they are supposed 
to have descended. 

First of all, I will give a list of the tribes and their subdivisions:

13d. Laa'luis. 

13 e. Q'o'mT'uox. 

This list is not quite complete, but very nearly so. A number of tlie 
clans are subdivided into smaller groups, but it is very difficult to 
ascertain these sul)divisions. Thus the ISTaqcVrng-ilisala embrace a sub- 
division called Me'Emaqaua, who are, ho^vever, not considered a separate 
clan. The La/la-uiLEla of the La'Lasiqoala are divided into two divi- 
sions — the (r-'eg-'o'te, the descendants of G-'o'te, and the Ilii'heqolaL, 
the descendants of Ha'qolaL. The La'alaxsEnt'aid of the Kwakiutl 
proper consist of three divisions: The La'alaxsEnt'aio proper, the 
A'lk'unweE (=lower corner, speakers of the first division), and the 
He/ha'me'tawe, the descendants of Ha'me'tawe. The Ts'E'nts'Enx-qaio 
of the Wa/las Kwakiutl are divided in two divisions — the Ts'E'nq'am 
and Hai'maaxsto. These divisions are given merely as examples, as I 
have not been able to discover all the subdivisions of the different 
clans and tribes. 

The recent history of these tribes and clans explains the develop- 
ment of this exceedingly comi)lex social system. Historical tradition 
has it that the Gue/tEla and the Q'o'moyue, both septs of the Kwakiutl, 
not very long ago formed one tribe. At one time a quarrel arose 
between them, in which Lfi/qoag-ila, the head chief of the Gue'tEla, 
was killed. Then they divided, and since that time form two septs. 
There is a saying indicating the close relationship of the two, to the 
effect that the Gue'tEla and the Q'o'moyue are twins — the former suckled 
at the mother's right breast, the latter at the left. 

Still another tribe, which, however, 1 have not included in the above 
list on account of its recent origin, has branched off from the Kwakiutl. 
These people call themselves Ma'tilpe, i. e., the highest Maa'mtag-ila, 
and include the septs Maa'mtag-ila, G-e'xsEm, and Haai'lak-Emae, all 
of which are found among tlie Gue'tEla and Q'o'moyue. 

While in these two cases new tribes were formed by a process of 
division, in one other case, at least, a tribe has recently become a clan 
of another tribe, namely, the Laa'luis of the Le'kwiltoq, who have 
joined the Kue'xa of the same group and form a fourth clan of the 
latter. The event happened during the great war with the southern 
Salishan tribes, which was waged in the middle of this century, the 
cause of the amalgamation being the great reduction of the tribe. 
The Q'o'm'enox have become entirely extinct. Another tribe which 
lived near the Qn'scir-mox, of which, however, we have only traditional 
reports, the Xoysi'les, have been exterminated by the Qo'sqemox. 

These few authentic facts show that the numbers of tribes and of 
clans have undergone considerable changes during historical times. 
This conclusion is corroboi-ated by the distribution of clans among 
various tribes, and by the meaning of their names. We may distinguish 
three classes of tribal names and of clan names, viz, such as are 
collective forms of the name of the ancestor, names taken from the 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 333 

re^s^ion inhabited by the tribe or clan, and names of honor. There is a 
decided tendency to substitute names of the hist class for others. 
Thus the name Q'o'nioyue (the rich ones) is new. The Xa'xamatsEs 
took the name Wa/litsum (the great ones) only twenty-five or thirty 
years ago. I presume that the names (x'I''g-ihiam (those who receive 
lirst), G-e'xsEm (chiefs), TE'niLtEmLEls (those under whom the ground 
shakes), were adopted in a simihir way. Other changes of names 
occur. Thus the I^imkish call themselves recently Lad'koatx, which 
is the name of one of the tril)es of the west coast of Vancouver Island, 
and the Lau'itsis are adopting the name Ts'a/mac, which is the name 
of the Songish in the Comox dialect. 

The geographical names are more suggestive. We find among the 
Nindiish a clan called Ne'nelk-'enox, the people from the head waters of 
Ninikish Eiver. This would seem to indicate that the head waters of 
the river was their ancient home, and that they have joined the rest 
of the Ximkish. The same may be said of the O'manits'enox clan of 
the L'n/sq'enox, the Qoe'qoaainox of the T'Eua'xtax, and the Ne'nelpae 
of the Qoe'xsot'enox. 

In all cases where the dan name or the tribal name is a collective 
form of the name of the ancestor, we may assume that the grouj) 
formed at one time a single commauity. How this unit may be broken 
appears in the case of the Ma'tilpe. We observe that (]uite a number 
of such clan names are common to several tribes. Thus the Si'sinLae, 
the descendants of Si'uLae, are found among the Groasi'la, Na/q'oaqtoq, 
Gue'tEla, Lau'itsis, and Ximkish. The Yaai'x'aqEmae, the descend- 
ants of Yix*n'qEmae, are found among the Q'o'moyue and T'Ena'xtax. 
I believe that in all these cases part of the original clan has drifted 
away from its original home, keeping its old name. This view is sus- 
tained by the tradition that the clans were divided at the time of the 
great flood, one part drifting here, another there. 

Still another case that gives evidence of the gradual development of 
the present system of clans and tribes is furnished by the Ma'malele- 
qala and Wi'weqae. Both these names are the collective forms of the 
names of the ancestors. Nevertheless the Ma'maleleqara and Wi'wea- 
qam, the Ma'leleqala grouj), and the We'qae group appear as subdi- 
visions of these tribes. It seems to me that this proves that these 
subdivisions must have formed the original stock, which the other clans 
joined in course of time. 

All this evidence proves that the present system of tribes and clans 
is of recent growth and has undergone considerable changes. 

The traditions of the clans show clearly what we must consider the 
original unit of society among the Kwakiutl. Each clan derives its 
origin from a mythical ancestor, who built his house at a certain place 
and whose descendants lived at that place. In a great many cases these 
places prove to be old village sites. In some, large accumulations of 
shells are found, which show that they have been inhabited through 



334 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

loni;' periods. We conclude, therefore, that tlie clan was originally a 
village community, which, owing to changes in number or for pur- 
poses of defense, left their old home and joined some other community, 
retaining, however, to a certain degree its independence. This corre- 
sponds exactly to the social organization of the Salishau tribes of the 
southern portion of Vancouver Island, and of all the coast tribes of 
Washington and Oregon. The simple division into village communi- 
ties which seems to have been the prevalent type of society along a 
considerable portion of the Pacific Coast has, among the Kwakiutl, 
undergone such changes that a number of tribes which are divided 
into clans have originated. 

While it would be natural that in tlie former stage the child should 
be considered a member of the village community to which his father or 
mother belonged, we may expect disturbances in the organization which 
developed among the Kwakiutl. Among the village communities of 
Oregon, Washington, and southern Vancouver Island the child belongs 
to the father's village, where the married couple generally live, and it 
seems that among many of these tribes the villages are exogamic. 
Among the Kwakiutl the clans are also exogamic, and certain privi- 
leges are inherited in the paternal line, while a much larger number 
are obtained by marriage. The existence of the foruier class suggests 
that the organization must have been at one time a ])urely paternal 
one. Three causes seem to have disturbed the original organization — 
the development of the more complex organization mentioned above, 
the influence of the northern tribes which have a purely maternal 
organization, and the development of legends referring to the origin of 
the clans which are analogous to similar traditions of the northern 
groups of tribes. Taking up the last-named point first, we find that 
each clan claims a certain rank and certain privileges which are based 
upon the descent and adventures of its ancestor. These privileges, if 
originally belonging to a tribe which at one time has been on the paternal 
stage, Avould hardly have a tendency to deviate from the law govern- 
ing this stage. If they have, however, originated under the influence 
of a people which is on a maternal stage, an abnormal development seems 
likely. In the north a woman's rank and imvileges always descend 
upon her children. Practically the same result has been brought about 
among the Kwakiutl, but in a manner which suggests that a people 
with paternal institutions has adapted its social laws to these customs. 
Here the woman brings as a dower her father's position and privileges 
to her husband, who, however, is not allowed to use them himself, but 
acquires them for the use of his son. As the woman's fatlier, on his 
part, has acquired his privileges in the same manner through his mother, 
a purely female law of descent is secured, although only through the 
medium of the husband. It seems to my mind that this exceedingly 
intricate law, which will be described in detail in the course of this 
paper, can not be explained in any other way than as an adaptation of 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 335 

maternal laws by a tribe wbich was on a paternal stage. 1 can not 
imagine that it is a transition of a maternal society to a paternal soci- 
ety, because tbere are no relics' of the former stage beyond those which 
we find everywhere, and which do not prove that the transition has 
been recent at all. There is no trace left of an inheritance from the 
wife's brothers; the young couple do not live with the wife's parents. 
But the most important argument is that the customs can not have 
been prevalent in the village communities from which the present 
tribal system originated, as in these the tribe is always designated as 
the direct descendants of the mythical ancestor. If the village com- 
munities had been on the maternal stage, the tribes would have been 
designated as the descendants of the ancestor's sisters, as is always 
the case in the legends of the northern tribes. 

Names and all the privileges connected with them may be obtained, 
also, by killing the owner of the name, either in war or by murder. 
The slayer has then the right to put his own successor in the place 
of his killed enemy. In this manner names and customs have often 
spread from tribe to tribe. 

It remains to substantiate what I have said by telling the legends of 
a few clans. I shall give a fuller account of these legends later on, 
while at this place I will merely refer to such passages as are of impor- 
tance in our present consideration. The clan O'manits'enox of the 
L'a'sq'enox derive their origin from Ts'i'lqoaloLEla, the husband of 
L'e'sElaqa ( = Sun woman). The former came down from heaven while 
his wife stayed there because she had to attend to the moving sun. 
He was accompanied by his children Se'paxaes ( = Shining down), 
Ya'q'Ent'Emae (=First speaker), G-e'xdEu, and Da'doqanaqesEla 
( = Seeing from one corner to the other). From these the clan origi- 
nated (Appendix p. 605). 

The following genealogy of the clan La/la-uiLEla of the La'Lasiqoala 
is a still better example :

A great number of examples of this kind might be given. It is true 
that these traditions are probably not very old, and have been modified 
with the changing social life of the people; but from what we know of 
the development of myths we should expect to find in them traces, at 
least, of the old maternal institutions, if they had ever existed. The 
fact that they invariably and always are explained by genealogies, such 
as the above, seems to my mind conclusive proof that a paternal 
organization of the tribe preceded the present one. 



336 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

I referred several times above to tlie fact that the claus have certain 
rights ill whicli the others do not share. These are mainly the use of 
certain crests and of semi -religious performances. All of these are 
acquired by marriage, as described above. In the village communities 
of the southern tribes we find no trace of a crest, while among the 
Kwakiutl it is not strictly hereditary, but descends through marriage 
in the female line, in a similar way as the crest of the northern tribes 
descends. The legends of the acquisition of the crest are also similar 
to the northern legends on the same subject, and I conclude, therefore, 
that the present stage has developed through contact of these two cul- 
tural areas. I do not mean to say that tlie ideas have been bodily bor- 
rowed by the Kwakiutl, Init that their manifestation in the social 
organization of the tribe is largely due to suggestion on the part of the 
northern tribes. The American idea of the acquisition of the manitou 
was evidently also fundamental among tlie Kwakiutl, as all their tales 
refer to it, and, as we shall see later on, the whole winter ceremonial is 
based on it. But it has assumed a peculiar form in so far as the manitou 
was acquired by a mythical ancestor and is now handed down from gen- 
eration to generation, and the connection has in many cases become so 
slight that the tutelary genius of the clan lias degenerated into a crest. 
This degeneration, together with the descent through marriage, I take 
to be due to the iniluence of the northern totemism. 

I give a few stories illustrating the acquisition of the crest through 
the ancestor, which will bring out the close analogy with the acquisi- 
tion of the manitou, and also show the manner in which the crest is 
used for adorning persons and utensils. 

The legend of the O'manits'enox, which I quoted above (Appendix, 
p. 005), goes on to tell how G-e'xdEn fell in with a number of killer whales, 
which had assumed the shape of men, and were mending their canoes. 
Their chief gave him the quartz-pointed whaling harpoon, his names, 
and the right to use the painting of the killer whale on his house front. 

Another good example is the following tradition of the clan La'xse of 
the Q'd'moyue or Kue/xa. I give here a translation : 

The first Kue'xa lived at Tsa/Xoyo. Their chief, Yc'iqoLalasame, 
we .t bear hunting up the river of LiXsT'wr' until he came to Sa/x-sox*. 
After he had been away four days, he saw the Ho'Xhoq (a fabulous 
bird, supposed to be similar to the crane) and heard its cry. It was 
larger than a man. Then Ye'iiioLalasamc hid. The Ho'Xhoq tried to 
find him, and finally discovered the place where the chief was in hiding 
at one side of a cedar tree. It tried to peck him with its beak, but 
missed him. Ye/iqoLalasamc merely jumped to the other side of the 
tree, and the Hd'Xhoq could not kill him. lie came home at night. 
Then he carved the crane out of yellow cedar, and now it is the 
carving of his clan (Plate 3). He invited all the tribes, and gave away 
cedar-bark blankets, all kinds of skins, canoes, and slaves. Then he 
placed tLc -...age of the Ho'Xhoii on top of a pole outside of his house.

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 337 

Later on, a chief of the (^Joe'xsot'enox wanted to have the carved 
Ho'Xhoq. His name was LEk*amii'xot. He tried to find out liow to 
obtain it, and learned that he had to marry the daugliter of Vc/iiio- 
Lalasamc in order to obtain it. Then he engaged himself to marry 
Ma'xalayuqoa, that chief's daughter. Ye/iqoL;llasame agreed, and they 
were married. Still later i*^Eqa'p'Enk-Em, chief of the K"kwa'kum of 
the Guc'tEla, obtained the Ho'Xhoq from the Qoc'xsot'enox by mar- 
riage. 

The first part of this legend shows again the close analogy to the 
acquisition of the manitou; the end shows how the privilege of using 
the carving was acquired, first by one tribe, then by the other. 

It is not necessary to multiply these examples. There exists, how- 
ever, another class of traditions, according to which the crests or 
emblems of the clan are not accpiired in this manner, but brougiit 
down by the ancestor of the clan from heaven or from the underworld 
or out of the ocean, wherever he may have derived his origin. This is 
the case with the Sl'sinLae, whose emblem is the sun (fig. 1). Here 
also belong the numerous tales of ancestors who came down from 
heaven, took off their masks, and became men, for in all these cases 
the mask has remained the crest of the clan. To this class belong the 
traditions of the G-i'g-ilqam of the Q'o'moyuc, of the Ts'E'nts'Enx*qaio, 
and many others. 

There is still another class of privileges connected with these tradi- 
tions, to which, however, I will only briefly refer at this place, as I have 
to treat them more fully later on. I mean the membership in secret 
societies. Many ancestors, when obtaining their manitous, were giveu 
the right to perform certain dances, or they were given secret songs, or 
the power to eat human flesh. These rights have also become hereditary, 
but they difl'er from the crest in so far as the character of the initiating 
spirit (the manitou) has been more clearly preserved. Each individual, 
who by descent or marriage is entitled to membership in one of the 
secret societies, must nevertheless, be initiated by its presiding spirit 
before joining the society. 

In all festivals references to these traditions are very frequent, and it 
is quite necessary to be acquainted with them in order to understand 
the proceedings and speeches, as will appear in the further progress of 
this description. 

Summing up the preceding considerations, we may say that the 
Kwakiutl consisted in olden times of a series of village communities 
among which descent was counted in the iiateiiial line, and the mem- 
bers of each community were considered descendants of one ancestor. 
These communities combined in groups, but the composing elements of 
the groups kept a certain degree of independence and continued to be 
considered as relatives. Each clan, as we may call the composing ele- 
ments of the tribe, developed a clan tradition, which was founded upon 
the acquisition of a manitou by the mythical ancestor, the manitou

becoming- hereditary in the clan. Owing 
to the influence of the northern tribes, 
this maiiitou became attenuated to a 
crest, which, in consequence of the 
same influence, no longer descends in the 
male line, but may be given in mar- 
riage, so that it descends upon the daugh- 
ter's children. 
So far we have 
considered the 
clan as a unit. 
The individu- 
als composing 
the clan do not 
form, however, 
a homogeneous 
mass, but ditt'er 
in rank. All 
the tribes of the Pacific Coast are divid- 
ed into a nobility, common people, and 
slaves. The last of these may be left 
out of consideration, as they do not 
form part and parcel of the clan, but 
are captives made in war, or purchases, 
and may change ownership as any 
other piece of property. The clan of the 
Kwakiutl is so organized that a certain 
limited number of families are recog- 
nized. The ancestor of each of these 
families has a tradition of his own aside 
from the general clan tradition, and, 
owing to the i)ossession of the tradi- 
tion, which almost always concerns the 
acquisition of a manitou, he has certain 
crests and i^rivileges of his own. This 
tradition and the crests and privileges 
connected with it descended, together 
with the name of the ancestor, upon his 
direct descendants in the male line, or, 
as indicated above, through marriage 
of his daughter, upon his son-in-law, 
and through him upon his grandchil- 
dren. But there is only one man at a 
time who personates the ancestor and 
who, consequently, has his rank and 
privileges. The individuals personat- 
ing the ancestors form the nobility of

the tribe. The number of noblemen is therefore lixed. They are not 
equal in rank, but range in the manner in whieh their ancestors were 
supposed to range. At all festivals they sit in the order of their rank, 
which is therefore called the •' seat " of the person ('la'qoe). The legend 
says that the order of seats was given by the deity at a festival of the 
tribes, at the time when animals were still able to speak. The noblest 
clan, and among them the noblest name, is called the "eagle" (kuc'k") 
of the tribe. In order to show the complexity of this system, I give a 
list of the nobility of one tribe :

These names are acquired by different individuals, but tliey are not 
necessarily retained tlirougli life, as with a neAv marriage a new name 
may be obtained from tlie new wife's father. The series is not beyond 
all doubt, since in many instances the Indians are not now-a-days quite 
certain as to the order of names. This is due to the I'act that tkefre 
are not enough individuals in the tribes to occupy all these places.. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 341 



III. The Potlatch. 



Before proceeding any further it will be necessary to describe the 
method of acquiring rank. This is done by means of the potlatch, or 
the distribution of property. This custom has beeu described often, 
but it has been thoroughly misunderstood by most observers. The 
underlying principle is that of the interest-bearing investment of 
property. 

The child when born is given the name of the place. whore it is born. 
This name (g-i'uLaxLc) it keeps until about a year old. Then his father, 
mother, or some other relative, gives a paddle or a mat to each member 
of the clan and the child receives his second name (nn'iiiap'axLeya). 
When the boy is about 10 or 12 years old, he obtains his third name 
(SomiatsExLa/ye). In order to obtain it, he must distribute a number 
of small presents, such as shirts or single blankets, among his own 
clan or tribe. When the youth thus starts out iu lite, he is liberally 
assisted by his elders, particularly by the nobility of the tribe. 

I must say hero that the unit of value is the single blanket, now-a- 
days a cheap white woolen blanket, which is valued at oO cents. The 
double blanket is valued at three single blankets. These blankets form 
the means of exchange of the Indians, and everything is paid for in 
blankets or in objects the value of which is measured by blankets. 
When a native has to pay debts and has not a sufficient number of 
blankets, he borrows them from his friends and has to pay the following 
rates of interest: 

For a period of a few months, for 5 borrowed blankets (> must be 
returned (Lc'k-o) ; for a period of six months, for 5 borrowed blankets 7 
must be returned (ma/'Laxsa Lc'k-oyo) ; for a period of twelve months or 
longer, for 5 borrowed blankets 10 must be returned (dc'ida or g-G/La). 

When a person has a i)oor credit, he may pawn his name for a year. 
Then the name must not be used during that period, and for 30 blaiikets 
which he has borrowed he must pay 100 in order to redeem his name. 
This is called q'a'q'oaxo (selling a slave). 

The rate of interest of the Lr''k'o varies somewhat around 25 per 
cent, according to the kindness of the loaner and the credit of the 
borrower. For a very sliort time blankets may be loaned without 
interest. This is designated by the same term. 

W^hen the boy is about to take his third name, he will borrow 
blankets from the other members of the tribe, who all assist him. He 
must repay them after a year, or later, with 100 per (;ent interest. Thus 
he may have gathered 100 blankets. In June, the time set for this act, 
the boy will distribute these blankets among his own tribe, giving 
proportionately to every member of the tribe, but a f«^w more to the 
chief. This is called La'X'uit. When after this time any mend)er of 
the tribe distributes blankets, the boy receives treble the amount he 
has given. The people juake it a point to repay him inside of a month. 



342 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEI^M, 1895. 



Thus he owns 300 blankets, of which, however, he iimst repay 200 after 
the hipse of a year. Ho loans the blankets out auioug- his friends, and 
thus at the close of the year he may possess about 400 blankets. 

The next June he pays his debts (qoana') in a festival, at which all 
the clans from whom he borrowed blankets are present. The festival 
is generally held on the street or on an open place near the village. 
Up to this time he is not allowed to take part in feasts. But now he 

may distribute proi)erty in order to obtain 
a potlatch name (p'a'tsaxLiiye). This is 
also called La/X'uit. 

At this time the father gives i\\) his seat 
(Lfi'Xoc) in favor of his son. After the boy 
has paid his debts, the chief calls all the 
older members of the tribe to a council, in 
which it is resolved that the boy is to re- 
ceive his father's seat. The chief sends 
his speaker to call the boy, and his clan go 
out in company with the speaker. The 
young man — for henceforth he will be 
counted among the men — dresses with a 
black headband and paints long vertical 
stripes, one on each side of his face, run- 
ning down from the outer corners of the 
eyes. The stripes represent tears. He 
gives a number of blankets to his friends, 
who carry them into the house where the 
council is being held. The speaker enters 
first and announces his arrival. The 
young man follows, and alter him enter 
his friends, carrying blankets. He re- 
mains standing in front of the fire, and 
the chief announces to him that he is to 
take his father's seat. Then the boy dis- 
tributes his blankets among the other clans 
and sells some for food, with which a feast 
is prepared. His father gives up his seat 
and takes his place among tlie old men 
(Xo'matsciL). The blankets given away 
at this feast are repaid with 100 x)er cent interest. In this manner the 
young man continues to loan and to distribute blankets, and thus is able, 
with due circumspection and foresight, to amass a fortune. Sometimes 
it happens that the successor to a man's name (Lawu'lqame) already has 
a name of his own. In all such cases (also when the name is acquired 
by inheritance) the successor gives up his mime and his property to his 
own successor. 

Possession of wealth is considered honorable, and it is the endeavor 
of each Indian to acquire a fortune. But it is not as much the posses-

sion of wealth as the ability to give great festivals which makes wealth 
a desirable object to the Indian. As the boy ac<iuires his second 
name and man's estate by means of a distribution of property, which 
in course of time will revert to him with interest, the man's name 
acquires greater weight in the councils of the tribe and greater renown 
among the whole people, as he is able to distribute more and more 
property at each subsequent festival. Therefore boys and men are 
vying with each other in the arrangement of great distributions of 
property. Boys of different clans are pitted against each other by 
their elders, and each is exhorted to do his utmost to outdo his rival. 
And as the boys strive against each other, 
so do the chiefs and the whole clans, and 
the one object of the Indian is to outdo 
his rival. Formerly feats of bravery 
counted as well as distributions of prop- 
erty, but nowadays, as the Indians say, 
"rivals fight with property only." The 
clans are thus perpetually pitted against 
each other according to their rank. The 
Kwakiutl tribes are counted as the high 
est in the order given in the above list. 
In intertribal rivalry they do not strive 
against each other, but the 

Gue'tEla against the Ma'iiialeleqala. 
Q'o'moyur against the Qotl'xsot'enox. 
Q'o'mk'utis against the NE'niqic or LaO'koatx. 
Wa'las Kwakintl against the taii'itslsor Ts'a'mas. 

I referred several times to the distribu- 
tion of blankets. The recipient in such a 
distribution is not at liberty to refuse the 
gift, although according to what I have 
said it is nothing but an interest-bearing 
loan that must be refunded at some future 
time with 1 00 per cent interest. This fes- 
tival is called p'a'sa, literally, flattening 
something (for instance, a basket). This 
means that by the ajiiount of property given the name of the rival is 
flattened. 

There is still another method of rising in the social scale, namely, by 
showing one's self superior to the rival. This may be done by inviting 
the rival and his clan or tribe to a festival and giving him a consider- 
able number of blankets. He is compelled to accept these, but is not 
allowed to do so unfil after he has placed an equal number of blankets 
on top of the pile offered to him. This is called dripEutg-ala and the 
blankets placed on top of the first pile are called da'pEno. Then he 
receives the whole pile and becomes debtor to that amount, i. e., he 
must repay the gift with 100 per cent interest.

A similar proceeding takes place when a canoe is given to a rival. 
The latter, Avlien the gift is ofiered to him, must put blankets to the 
amount of half the value of the canoe on to it. This is called da'g-dt, 
taking hold of the bow of the canoe. These blankets are kept by the 
first owner of the canoe. Later on, the recipient of the canoe must 
return another canoe, together with an adequate number of blankets, as 
an "anchor line'' for the canoe. This giving of a canoe is called sa'k-a. 

Still more complicated is the purchase or the gift, however one 
chooses to term it, of a "copper." All along the North Pacific Coast, 
from Yakutat to Comox, curiously shaped cop])er plates are in use, 
which in olden times were made of native copper, which is found in 
Alaska and probably also on Nass River, but which nowadays are 
worked out of imported copper. The typical shape of these copper 
plates may be seen in figs, li and 3 and I'late 4. The T-shaped i^art 
(qa'la's), which forms two ridges, is hammered. The top is called "the 
face" (o'nuxLEme), the lower part the hind end (o'nutsExstc). The 
front of the copper is covered with black lead, in which a face, repre- 
senting the crest animal of tlie owner, is graven. These coppers have 
the same function wliich bank notes of high denominations have with 
us. The actual value of the piece of copj)er is small, but it is made to 
represent a large number of blankets and can always be sold for 
blankets. The value is not arbitrarily set, but depends upon the 
amount of property given away in the festival at which the copper is 
sold. On the whole, the oftener a copper is sold the higher its value, 
as every new buyer tries to invest more blankets in it. Therefore the 
purchase of a copper also brings distinction, because it proves that the 
buyer is able to bring together a vast amount of property. 

Each copper has a name of its own, and from the following list of 
coppers, which were in Fort Rupert in 1893, the values attached to some 
of them may be seen : 

Ma'xts'olEm (^; all other coppers are ashamed to look at it), 7,500 hlankets." 

L'a'xolamas (= steel-liead salmon, i. e., it glides ont of one's hands like a salmon), 
6,000 blankets. 

Lo'peiila (= making the house empty of blankets), 5,000 blankets. 

DE'ut'alayo ( = abont whose possession all are quarreling). 

Man'ak-'a (=8ea lion). 

Qau'ld ma (^beaver face). 

Le'ita (=:looking below; namely, in order to find blankets with which to buy it). 

Nfi'se (=moou; its engraviug represents the half moon, in which a man is sitting).

The purchase of a high-priced copper is an elaborate ceremony, which 
must be described in detail. The trade is discussed and arranged long 
beforehand. When the buyer is ready, he gives to the owner of the 
copper blankets about one-sixth of the total value of the copper. This 
is called ''•making a i)illow" for the cop])er (qc'nullLa); or "making 
a feather bed" (ta'lqoa) or "the harpoon line at which game is hang- 
ing " (do'xsEmt), meaning that in the same manner the copper is 
attached to the long line of blankets; or "taken in the hand, in order 
to lift the copper'' (da/g-ilclEui). The owner of the copper loans these 
blankets out, and when he has called them in again, he repays the total 
amount received, with 100 i)er cent interest, to the purchaser. On the 
following (lay the tribes assemble for the sale of the copper. The pre- 
scribed proceeding is as follows: The buyer offers first the lowest 
prices at which the copper was sokl. The owner declares that he is 
satisfied, but his friends demand by degrees higher and higher prices, 
according to all the previous sales of the copper. This is called g-i'na. 
Finally, the amount offered is deemed satisfactory. Then the owner 
asks for boxes to carry away the bhmkets. These are counted five 
pairs a box, and are also paid in blankets or other objects. After 
these have been paid, the owner of the copper calls his friends — mem- 
bers of his own tribe- — to rise, and asks for a belt, which he values at 
several hundred blankets. While these are being brought, he and his 
tribe generally repair to their house, where they paint their faces and 
dress in new blankets. When they have finished, drums are beaten in 
the house, they all shout " hi ! " and go out again, the speaker of the seller 
first. As soon as the latter has left the house, he turns and calls his 
chief to come down, who goes back to where the sale is going on, fol- 
lowed by his tribe. They all stand in a row and the buyer puts down 
the blankets which w^ere demanded as a belt, " to adorn the owner of the 
copper.'' This whole i)urchase is called "putting the copi)er under the 
name of the buyer" (La/sa). 

In this i)roceeding the blankets are placed in piles of moderate 
height, one pile close to the other, so that they occupy a considerable 
amount of space. In Fort Rupert there are two high i)osts on the 
beach bearing carved figures on top, betweeu which the blankets are 
thus i)i]e(l (Plate o). They stand about 40 steps apart. 

On the following day all the blankets which have been paid for the 
copper must be distril)uted by the owner among his own tribe, paying 
to them his old debts first, and, if the amount is sufficient, giving new 
presents. This is called "doing a great thing" (wa'lasila). 

Coppers are always sold to rivals, and often a man will offer his cop- 
jjer for sale to the rival tribe. If it is iiot accepted, it is an acknowl- 
edgment that nobody in the tribe has money enough to buy it, and 
the name of the tribe or clan would consequently lose in weight. 
Therefore, if a man is willing to accept the offer, all the members of 
the tribe must assist him in this undertaking with loans of blankets. 



346 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Debts wbicli are repaid in the wa'lasila were mostly contracted in this 
manner. 

In order to better illustrate this curious proceeding, I will describe 
the sale of a copper which took place in the winter of 1894-95. 

First, a feast was celebrated, in which the Ma'maleleqala offered the 
copper Ma/xts'olEra for sale to the Kwakiutl. Ma'Xua, chief of the 
clan Maa'mtag-ila, invited all tlie tribes to his house. Then he spoke : 

"Come, tribe, to my house. This is the house of the first Ma'Xua 
at G-agaxsdals. 

"This is the feast house of Ma'Xua here. 

"This is the house to which Msi'Xua invited at Bg'ivsbalis. 

"This is the house to which Ma'Xua invited at Qald'gwis. 

"This is the feast house of Ma'Xua at G-a/qis. 

"This is the house to which my father invited at Tsa'xis. 

"I take the place of my father now. 

"I invited you, tribes, that j^ou should come and see my house here. 

"I am proud to speak of my ancestor, the chief who in the beginning 
of the world had the name Ma'Xua." 

Then Ma'Xua turned to his own tribe and said: " Yes, K''esoyag*ilis. 
Yes, Ma'Xuag-ila. Let me speak of my ways, Wa, wa! thus I speak, 
my tribe." Then he turned again to the other tribes and told them 
to sing, saying, "Go on, tell the whole world, tribes! go on and sing; 
this was given to our ancestors in the beginning of the world by 
Kuekuaxa'oe.*" 

Now Ma'Xua stopped speaking, and Qoayo'Llas, chief of the Ma'mal- 
eleqala of the clan Wa'las, spoke: "Yes, Chief! it is true what you said. 
I thank you for your words, Chief! Our ways are not new ways. They 
were made by our chief (the deity) and marked out for us when he made 
our ancestors men. We try to imitate what our ancestors were told to 
do by the creator. Keep in your old ways, Kwakiutl; keep in the ways 
of your grandfathers, who laid down the custom for you." Then 
he turned to his own tribe and said: "That is what I say, Wa'k-as. 
That is what I say, XEg-e'. The word of the chief shall not hurt 
me." Now he took the copper (Plate 6) and said: "Now sing my 
song!" His tribe sang, and after they had finished Qoayo'Llas spoke 
again: "Yes, my tribe! I can not help how I feel; I have nothing 
against the way, Kwakiutl, in which you treat me and my tribe. Now 
I will promise blankets to you, Kwakiutl, blankets to you, Gue'tEla, 
blankets to you, Q'd'mdyue, blankets to you, Q'd'mk-utis, blankets to 
you, Walas Kwakiutl: this copper belongs to Ts'a'xts'agits'Emqa, the 
son of Walas XEmd'gwis. Now take care, great tribe! This great 
copper has a high price; its name is Ma'xts'olEm (the one of whom all 
are ashamed). Now I am going to lay it down before you, Kwakiutl. 
Do not let me carry it myself, La'bid ! Take it to the chiefs."

Then La'bid arose and spoke: "Say this jigain, my chief! Now look 
out, chiefs of the Kwakiutl, this is Se/xitg-ila Ma'xts'olEm.' This I will 
bring to yon." 

Then he stepped toward the Kwakintl, and put the copper on the lioor 
where they were sitting. Now Owaxil/lag-ilis arose, took the copper, and 
spoke: "Thank you, Walas NEinO'gwis. Come now, sahuon, for which 
our forefathers have been watching. This is Ma/xts'OlEm. I will buy 
this Mfi/xts'olEm. Now pay me, Kwakiutl, what I loaned to you, that 
I may buy it qui(;kly, in order to keep our name as high as it is now. 
Don't let us be afraid of the price of Ma'xts'olEm, my tribe, wa, wa! 
Now put down the dishes, that our tribe may eat." 

Owaxfi'lag-ilis sat down, the young man distributed the dishes, and 
all the tribes ate. Now Ma'Xua stepped up again and spoke kindly to 
the eating people. "Go on," he said, "eat, Walas NEmo'gwis; eat, 
He'Lamas; eat, NEg-e'; eat you, Ma'maleleqala; eat, La'qoLas; eat, 
G*'ote, you NB'mqic; eat, Se/wit'e; eat, E'wanuX; eat you, Lau'itsis; 
eat, Wa'k-as; eat, Pd'tLide, you, Ma/t'ilpe; eat, Wats'e; eat, He'was,you 
T'Ena'xtax. Eat, all you tribes. Now it is done. I have already told 
you of my grandfather. This food here is the good will of our fore- 
father. It is all given away. Now, look out, Kwakiutl! our chief 
here is going to buy this copper, and let us help him, wa, wa!" Then 
spoke Ha'raEsk'inis and said: "Your words are true. Chief ! how true are 
your words. I know how to buy coppers ; I always pay high prices for 
coppers. Now take care, Kwakiutl, my tribe, else you will be laughed 
at. Thus I say, O'ts'estalis; thus I say, Wa'nuk"; thus 1 say, young 
chiefsof the Kwakiutl; thus I say, Tso'palis; thusi say, O'gwila; thus 
I say, O'mx-'it, young chiefs of the Q'o'moyue ; thus I say, Qoe/malasts'e ; 
thus Isay,Yeqawit, chiefs of the Q'o'mk-utis; thus I say, Qoayo'Llas; 
thus I say, Wa/kldis, young chiefs of the Wtllas Kwakiutl. This is 
my speech for our children, Ma/Xuag-ila, that they may take care, 
wa, wa!" Then QoayO'Llas stood up again and said: "Thank you; 
did you hear, Lfibid? Ho, ho, ho, ho, no, no, no. [The "ho'' means the 
lifting of the heavy copper from the ground; the "no" is the cry of the 
Ts'd'noqoa.p Now let me invite them, Ma'maleleqala; I believe they 
want to buy my copj^er. Now I will invite them." Then his tribe said : 
"Do it, do it," and he continued : " Now, Gue'tEla, behold the dance of 
La'qoag-Ilayukoa, the daughter of Wiilas NEmd'gwis, Now, Q'o'moyue, 
see the dance of AomdLa, the daughter of Walas NEmo'gwis. Now, 
Q'd'mk-utis, see the dance of Ma'mx-oyukoa, the daughter of Wrdas 
NEmo'gwis. Now, Wrdas Kwa'kiutl, see the dance of Ma'Xualag-ilis, 
the son ot Walas NEmo'gwis. These are my words, wa, wa!'' 

Then all the guests went out. Later on Owaxn'lag-ilis invited all 
the Kwakiutl, Ma'malOleqala, NE'mqic, Lau'itsis, T'Ena'xtax, and 
Ma'tilpe, because he intended to buy the copper Ma'xts'olEm that

inoruiHg on the beacb. Then all the tribes assembled. Owaxa'lag'ilis 
stood on tbe beach aud spoke. He said : 

"Now, come, chiefs of all the tribes. Yes, you come, because we 
want to do a great work. Now, I am going to buy the copper 
Ma/xts'dlEm, of Walas Nsmo'gwis. Only don't ask too high a price 
for it. And yon, young chiefs of the Kwakiutl, take care and help me. 
Go now aud bring the blankets from my house." 

Then the young men went and piled up the blankets on the beach. 
Ma'Xua and ( )'ts'estalis counted them. One man of the Ma'malf'leqala, 
one of the Nimkish, one of the Lau'itsis, kept the tally.' 

Ma'Xua spoke: "It is my office to take care of the property of our 
chief. It was the office of my forefathers. Now I will begin." Then 
he counted one pair, two pairs, three pairs, four pairs, tive pairs, six pairs, 
seven pairs, eight pairs, nine pairs, ten pairs. As soon as ten pairs 
were counted, he said aloud, "ten pairs," and the counters repeated, 
"twenty blankets," and put two stones aside. When Ma'Xua had 
counted another ten pairs, the counters said, "forty blankets," and put 
two more stones aside. They continued to inxt aside two stones for 
each ten pairs of blankets (Plates 7 and 8). Two men kept on piling up 
the blankets, and when they had piled up 1,000 blankets, Ma/Xua said 
aloud, "One thousand blankets." The blankets were piled up along- 
side of a carved beam standing on the beach (Plate 5). When the i)ile 
was high enough, a new one was begun right next to the tirst pile. 

1'lien Owaxil'lag-ilis arose aud spoke: "Tribes, I bay the copper 
Ma'xts'olEm with these 1,000 blankets. I shall not give any more 
unless the chiefs of all the tribes should ask for more, wa! That is 
my speech, chiefs of the Ivwakiutl." Now he sat down and Walas 
NEmo'gwis arose. He said : " Ya, Owaxa/lag'ilis ! are your words true ? 
Did you say it was enough?" Then he turned to his tribe and said, 
" Ya, Olsi'wit! Now rise, chief, aud sjieak for me. That is what I say, 
Lri'bide." 

Then Olsl'wit arose (see Plates and 10) and said: "Are those your 
words, Kwakiutl ? Did you say this was all that you were going to give 
for the copper ? Are there 1,000 blankets ? " The counters replied, " Yes, 
there are 1,000 blankets." Olsl'wit contimied: "Thank you, OwaxsV- 
lagilis. Chief. Do you think you have finished? Now take care, 
Ivwakiutl ! You, Chief, give twenty times ten pairs more, so that there 
will be 200 more." Then he turned to his tribe and said, "Chiefs of the 
Ma'maleleqala ! Now, I have said my words, Chief Walas NEmo'gwis." 

Tlien Owaxa'lag'ilis arose and said: "Your S])eech, OlsT'wit, is good. 
It ])leases my heart." And he said to the young men: "Go and bring 
200 blankets from my house." They went at once and brought those 
blankets. 

Then Ma'Xua arose and counted the blankets. He called out how

many there were. He said: '^ There are 1,200 blankets in a pile here, 
chiefs of all the tribes, wa, wa!" 

Kow Olsl'wit arose and said: "Thank you, Kwakiutl. Ycrily, I got 
all I asked for in my speech and we Ma^malelecpila are pleased, 
wa, wa!" 

Again Walas N^Emo'gwis arose and spoke: "Thank yon, Owaxa'- 
lag-ilis, thank you, Chief. It will not be my desire if all the chiefs of 
my tribe ask for more blankets. I am satisfied." ]S^ow he turned to 
his tribe and said : " >^ow we must speak, my tribe. Arise, G-e'g-EsLEn. 
Speak, Chief! Speak more strongly." 

Then G-e'g-ESLEn arose and said: " How nice it is, tribes! I thank 
you for your words, Owaxa'lag-ilis. Yes, Chiefs, that is our way, to 
which you must conform. You were not provident when you resolved 
to buy this great copper. My heart is well inclined toward you. Chief I 
You have not finished; you will give more. The price of tlie copper 
must correspond to my greatness, and I ask forty times ten blankets, 
that is 400 blankets more, Chief. That is what I mean, forty. Wa, 
Chief. I shall not speak again if I get what I ask from you." Then he 
turned to his own tribe. "Chief Walas NEmo'gwis, I have done what 
you asked of me. You asked me to speak strongly to that chief, wa, wa !" 

Then Owaxa'lag-ilis arose and spoke, lie said: "Yes, Chief, your 
speech was good. You have no pity. Have you finished now asking 
for more, if I am willing to give your chief 400 blankets 7uore ? Answer 
me now!" Now G-e'g-EsLEu spoke: "I shall not try to speak again." 
Owaxa'lag'ilis sent two young men. They l)rought the blankets and 
put them down. Again Ma'Xua took the blankets and spoke: 

" Ya, tribes ! Do you see now our way of buying ? The Kwakiutl, my 
tribe, are strong when they buy coppers. They are not like you. You 
always bring the canoes and the button blankets right away. Now 
there are 1,000 blankets in this pile that I carry here." He turned to 
the Kwakiutl and said: "That is what I say, Chiefs of the Kwakiutl, 
to those who do not know how to buy coi)pers. Now 1 begin again." He 
counted tlie blankets and went on in the same way as before. As soon 
as ten pairs of blankets were counted, tliey said aloud, "ten pairs," and 
the counters said aloud how many tens of blankets had been counted. 
When he had counted all, Ma'Xua spoke: "Wa, wa! Now I say to 
you, chiefs of all the tribes, it is really enough ! I have pity upon my 
chief. That is what I say, chiefs." 

Then ( )waxa/]ag-ilis arose and spoke: " Wa, wa! I say it is enough, 
Ma'maleleqala. Now you have seen my name. This is my name; this 
is the weight of my name. This mountain of blankets rises through 
our heaven. My name is the name of the Kwakiutl, and you can not do 
as we do, tribes. When you do it, you finish Just as soon as you reach 
the 1,000 blankets. Now, look out! later on I shall ask you to buy 
from me. Tribes! I do not look ahead to the time when j'ou will buy 
from me. My chiefs! that is what I say, O'tsT'Stalis: that is what I

say, Wa'kldis; that is what I say, Mil/Xualag-ilis; that is what 1 say, 
Ma'Xnayalisame. That is what I say for all of you from whom cop 
pers may be bought, by the chiefs of these our rivals, the Ma'maleleqala, 
Wa, wa!'' 

Then Walas NEmo'gwis arose aud spoke: "Yes, Chief, your speech 
is true, your word is true. Who is like you, Kwakiutl, who buy cop])ers 
aud who give away blankets. Long life to all of you, chiefs of the 
Kwakiutl. I can not attain to your high name, great tribes." Then he 
turned to his tribe and said: "That is what I said, chiefs of the 
Ma'malele([ala, that we may beat these Kwakiutl. They are like a 
large mountain with a steep precipice. JSTow arise, Ya/qaLEnlis, and 
speak. Chief! Let me see you that I may look up to you. Chief ! Now 
call your name, Ts'o'noqoa, you, Chief, who knows how to buy that great 
copper. You can not be equaled by anybody. You great mountain 
from which wealth is rolling down, wa, wa! That is what I say, ray 
tribe!" 

Then Ya'qaLEnlis arose aud uttered the cry of Ts'o'noqoa: "ho, ho, 
ho, ho!" and he acted as though he was lifting the heavy weight of the 
copper from the ground. "You all know, Kwakiutl, who I am. My 
name is Ya'qaLEulis. The name began at the time when our world was 
made. I am a descendant of the chiefs about whom we hear in the ear- 
liest legends. TheHo'Xhoq camedown toXo'xop'a,andtookoff his bird 
mask and became a man. Then he took the name Ya'qaLEulis. That 
was my ancestor, the lirst of the Qoe'xsdt'enox. He married La'qoag'i- 
layuqoa, the daughter of Walas NEmo'gwis, the first chief of the great 
clan WewamasqEm of the Ma'maleleqala. That is the reason why [ 
speak. I know how to buy great coppers. I bought this copper 
Ma/xts'olEm for 4,000 blankets. What is it. Chief? What is it, Owa- 
xfi'lag-ilis'? Come! did you not give any thought to my copper here? 
You always say that you are rich. Chief. Now give more, that it may 
be as great as I am. Give only ten times 100 blankets more, Chief Owa- 
xa'lag'ilis. It will not be much, give 1,000 more for my sake, wa, wa. 
This is what I say, Ha'wasalaL; that is what I say, He'Xuayus; that 
is what I say, WawilapalasO; that is what I say for all of you, chiefs 
of the Ma'maleleqala, Wa, wa!" 

Then Owaxa'lag-ilis arose and spoke: "Yes, yes, you are feared by 
all, Great Chief! Do not show mercy in your speech. Now I am going 
to ask all of you, chiefs of the Ma'maleleqala, will you stop talking if I 
give you these 1,000 blankets in addition to the 1,600 blankets on this 
pile"? If you say it is not enough after I have added the 1,000 blankets, 
then I will not force the purchase of the copper. 

"Now answer me, Walas NEmo'gwis. I have seen no one giving 
1,000 blankets more. 1 should tell a lie if I should say I had ever seen 
it done, as you demand, wa! That is what I say, chiefs of all the 
KM^akiutl." 

Now Wrdas NEmo'gwis arose and spoke: " Chiefs, it is not my desire; 
it is the desire of all those chiefs who asked for more; 1 have enough. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 351 

Bring now the 1,000 blankets for wliicli Chief Ya/qaLEulis asked, \va, 
wa! That is what I say, Ma'maleleqala, wa!" 

Now Owaxa'hig-ilis sent the young men to bring these 1,000 blankets. 
They brought them and Ma/Xua arose. He counted the blankets and 
called out every ten pairs. Then he made a speech: ''Yal tribes, 
have all the blankets here been counted?" The people'replied, "Yes, 
yes. Do not maintain. Chief, tliat we lost run of the number of blan- 
kets." Then Ma'Xua coutinued: "There are 2,600 blankets. lama 
Maa'mtag-ila, whose strength appears when they buy coppers. Take 
care, Chief Owaxa/lag-ilis, else we shall be laughed at. Do not give in ! 
Do not weaken, else you will not get that copper." 

Then O waxa'lag-ilis arose and spoke : " Your words are good, Ma'Xua- 
It is good that you strengthen my heart. Now speak, Walas XEmo'- 
gwis! Speak, Chief, and tell me your wishes, else I shall he too much 
troubled. Xow say your price and I will take it. That is what I say, 
Wa/kidis; that is what I say, Tsopa'lis, wa, wa!" 

Owaxa'lag-ilis sat down, and the tribes were silent. Xobody spoke, 
and Walas XEmo'gwis lay down on his back, covering his face with 
his blanket. For a long time nobody among all the men spoke. Then 
Ycqdk'ua/lag'ilis, the younger brother of Walas XEmO'gwis, arose and 
said: "Chiefs of the Kwakiutl, 1 know what makes my brother here 
sad. Try, chiefs, that your speech may please the heart of my chief 
here. That is what I say, chiefs of the Ma'maleleqala, Wa, wa!" 

Then Ha'mts'it arose and spoke: "Kwakiutl, I am afraid of the way 
in which my chief here is acting. He is making us asleep and all the 
tribes are asleep. That is always the way of the great chief. Xow, 
Owaxa/lag'ills, try to please him ! " 

Then Owaxa/lag-ilis arose and said: "Ha'mts'it! you said enough. 
Too many are your words. Let only him speak who knows how to buy 
that copper, Walas XEmo'gwts ! Do not let these children speak. That 
is what I say, Kwakiutl, Wa, wa! Xow look about in my house, if you 
find something to please the heart of this chief. Go ! young men.'^ 
They went, and soon they came back carrying blankets, which they 
put down. Owaxa/lag'ilis arose at once and asked the young men 
how many blankets they had brought. They replied: "Six hundred 
blankets." He continued: "Is it true what you said? Xow, chiefs of 
the Kwakiutl, I thank you for your words. Ma'Xua! Chief! count 
them ! " Ma'Xua arose and counted the blankets. Then he said : " Ya ! 
tribes, have you counted these blankets, also ? There are now 3,200. 
Look out ! chiefs of the tribes ! for I shall ask you to buy our coppers 
also! That is what I say, XEg-e'; that is what I say, E'wanuXts'e, 
wa, wa! that is what I say, chiefs of the Kwakiutl, wa, wa!" 

Xow Walas XEmd'gwis arose and said: "Xow take care, Ma' male - 
leqala ! Xow, I take that price for our copper. Xow give the boxes 
into which we may put the blankets. We need 50 boxes, and each 
will be worth 5 pairs of blankets." 

Then Owaxa'lag-ilis arose and spoke : " Thank you, Walas XEmo'gwis, 



352 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

for your speech. You say you take the price. Now go, chiefs of the 
Kwakiutl, aud bring the boxes! They will be 500 blankets' wortli, to 
be paid in canoes." Then the young men went and l)rought short split 
sticks. They brought 5 sticks. Ma'Xua took them and spoke: "Ya! 
tribes! truly, you do not think that your words are hard against ()wa- 
xa'lag'ilis ? Truly, you get easily Avhat you ask for, chiefs of the Ma'ma- 
ICdeqala. This canoe counts for a box worth 150 blankets. This canoe 
counts for a box worth 150 blankets. This canoe counts for a box worth 
100 blankets. This canoe counts for a box worth 60 blankets. This 
canoe counts for a box worth 40 blankets, wa, wa! Enough, chiefs of 
the Ma'malf'leqala. Now take pity on our chief here. That is what I 
say, Kwakiutl." Then Owaxa'lag-ilis arose and spoke : " Ya, son Wrdas 
NEnio'gwis, I think your heart is pleased. Now there are 3,700 blan- 
kets. There are 700 of the fourth thousand. Come, Walas NEmo'gwis, 
and you, chiefs, arise, that I may adorn you." Then Willas NEmo'gwis 
arose and spoke: "Come, Ma'Xmawisaqamaye! Come, Lfi'bid ! Come, 
Kwri'x-ilanokume ! Come, NEmo'kwag-ilis! Come, Hfi'wasalaL! Come, 
Xua/x'sistala! Come,()]sIwit! Come, G'c'g-ESLEu! Come, Ya/qaLEnlis! 
Come, Wa'k'asts'e ! Come, HA/misalaL ! Come, Ts'o'xts'ais ! Let him 
who brought our coi)per look at us ! Come, chiefs of the Ma'maleleqala." 
Then all the thirteen chiefs stood in a row, and Walas NEmO'gwis spoke : 
"This, Kwakiutl,is the strength of the Ma'maleleqala. These whom you 
see here are your rivals. These are the ones who have the great coppers 
which have names, and therefore it is hard work for you to rival them. 
Look out ! chiefs of the Ma'maleleqala ! in case they should bring us the 
copper Ma/xts'olEm, which we now sold, that one of you may take it up 
at once, or else we must be ashamed. That is what I say, chiefs of the 
Ma'maleleqala, Wa, wa! Now go on! Chief Owaxa/lag-ilis!" Then 
Owaxa'lag-ilis arose and spoke: "Yes, Walas NEmo'gwis, and you 
other good chiefs Avho are standing over there. Now, chiefs of the 
Kwakiutl, scurry about in my house for something witli which I may 
adorn the chiefs." Then the young men went. Soon they came back, 
carrying 200 blankets and two split sticks, on which five straight lines 
were marked with charcoal. 

Then Ma'Xua arose, took the split sticks, and said: "Thank you, 
chiefs of the Ma'maleleqala, for the way in which you act. It must be 
true that you are pleased with the way of our chief here. Now listen, 
chiefs! Adorn yourselves with this canoe, which is worth 50 blankets, 
and with this canoe, which is also worth 50 blankets, and with these 
200 blankets here. Now there are 4,000 blankets in all, Wa, wa! Let 
me say, it is done ! " 

Immediately Walas NEmo'gwis made a speech, and said: "I take 
this price, tribes ! Thank you, Chief Owaxa'lag-ilis; thank you. Chief; 
thank you, Kwakiutl." 

Now Owaxa'lag-ilis arose and spoke : " Ya, Walas NEmo'gwis. Have 
you taken the price, Chief? " AValas NEmo'gwis replied : " I have taken 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 353 

the price." "Why, Walas NEuio'gwis," said Owaxa'lag'ilis, " you take 
the price too soon; you must think poorly of rae, Chief! I am a 
KAvakiutl; I am one of those from whom all your tribes all over the 
world took their names. !Now you give up before I finished trading 
with you, Ma'maleleqala. You must always stand beneath us, wa, wa ! 
Now go, young men; call our chief here, that he may come and see the 
tribes. Bring Lu/qoag-ilak"'." Then the young men went, and soon 
they returned. The sister of Owaxa/lag-ilis followed them, carrying 
200 blankets. Owaxa'lag-ilis spoke: "Ya, tribes, come here! This is 
Lfi/qoag-ilak". That name comes from the oldest legends. Now, take 
her clothes and you, INIa'Xua, give them away ! " Now Ma'Xua counted 
the blankets. There were 200 blankets of the tlfth thousand. There 
were 4,200. '^Wa, wa! Chiefs of the Ma'maleleqala," said he. Then 
Wrdas NEmo'gwis spoke: "Thank you, chiefs! Now, Ma'maleleqala, 
we will divide the iiropert^'to-morrow, wa, wa!" 

It was described above how a boy is introduced into the distributions 
of property going ou among the tribe. It remains to state how he 
acquires his first copper. When the young man has acquired a certain 
number of blankets, one of his older friends invites him to take a share 
in the purchase of one of the cheaper coppers, which may have a value 
of, say, noo blankets. The boy contributes 200 blankets as his share 
and the other man purchases it, announcing the young man as his part- 
ner in tlie transaction. The copper is delivered to the young man, who 
becomes a debtor to his partner for the amount of blankets contributed 
by the latter. He announces at once that he will sell the copper the 
following year, but that he is willing to deliver the copper on the spot. 
With these words he lays it down before the tribe. One of the chiefs 
of a rival tribe takes the copjjer and pays as a first installment 100 
blankets. Then the boy promises a distribution of blankets (tso'Xua) 
for the following year and loans out the 100 blankets which he has 
received. The next year he calls in his outstanding debts and invites all 
the neighboring tribes to a feast, to which his own tribe contributes food 
and fuel. In the course of the festival he pays the chief who took his 
copper 200 blankets, being the value of the 100 blankets received the 
previous year, together with 100 per cent interest (see p. 311). Then 
the i:)urchaser pays the sum of 750 blankets for the copper, including 
boxes and belt, as described above. Of this amount 700 are distributed 
on the following day in the prescribed fashion among the neighboring 
tribes. Now the young man proceeds to loan out his blankets until 
within a few years he is able to repay the share of his partner who first 
helped him to buy the copper. When the time has come for this trans- 
action, his partner pays him double the amount of what he (the partner) 
has contributed, and the young man returns to him double of this 
amount. 

The rivalry between chiefs and clans finds its strongest exi)ression 
in the destruction of property. A chief will burn blankets, a canoe, or 
NAT MTJS 95 23

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



break ii copper, thus indicating his disregard of the amount of property 
destroyed and showing tliat Lis mind is stronger, liis power greater, 
than that of h-is rival. If the latter is not able to destroy an equal 
amount of property without much delay, his name is "broken." He is 
vanquished by his rival and his inliuence with his tribe is lost, while 
the name of the other chief gains correspondingly in renown. 

Feasts may also be counted as destruction of proi^erty, because the 
food given can not be returned except by giving another feast. The 

most expensive sort of feast is the one at 
which enormous quantities of fish oil (made 
of the oulaclion) are consumed and burnt, 
the so-called "grease feast." Therefore it 
also raises the name of the person who can 
afford to give it, and the neglect to speedily 
return it entails a severe loss of prestige. 
Still more feared is the breaking of a valu- 
able copper. A chief may break his copper 
and give the broken parts to his rival. If 
the latter wants to keep his i)restige, he 
must break a copper of equal or higher 
A^alue^, and then return both his own broken 
copper and the fragments which he has 
received to his rival. The latter may then 
pay for the copper which he has thus re- 
ceived. The chief to whom the fragments 
of the first copper are given may, however, 
also break his copper and throw both into 
the sea. The Indians consider that by this 
act the attacked rival has shown himself 
superior to his aggressor, because the latter 
may have expected to receive the l)roken 
copper of his rival in return so that au 
actual loss would have been prevented. 

In by far the greater number of cases 
where coppers are broken the copper is 
preserved. The owner breaks or cuts off 
one part after the other until finally only 
the T-shaped ridge remains. This is valued at two-thirds of tlie total 
value of the copper and is the last part to be given away. The order in 
which the parts of the copper are usually broken off is shoMni in the 
accomi)anying illustration (fig. 4). The rival to whom the piece that 
has been broken off is given, breaks off a similar piece, and returns both 
to the owner. Thus a copper may be broken up in contests with 
different rivals. Finally, somebody succeeds in buying up all the 
broken fragments, which are riveted together, and the copper has 
attained an increased value. Since the broken copper indicates the 
fact that the owner has destroyed property, the Indians pride them- 
selves upon their possession (see Plares 11 and 12).

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 355 

The rivalry between chiefs, when carried so far that coppers are 
destroyed and that grease feasts are given in order to destroy the 
prestige of the rival, often develop into open enniitj". When a person 
gives a grease feast, a great fire is lighted in the center of the house. 
The flames leap up to the roof and the gue>sts are almost scorched by 
the heat. Still the etiquette demands that they do not stir, else the 
host's fire has conquered them. Even when the roof begins to burn 
and the fire attacks the rafters, they must appear unconcerned. The 
host alone has the right to send a man up to the roof to put out the fire. 
While the feast is in progress the host sings a scathing song ridiculing 
his rival and praising his own clan, the feats of his forefathers and his 
own. Then the grease is filled in large spoons and passed to the rival 
chief first. If a person thinks he has given a greater grease feast than 
that offered by the host, he refuses the spoon. Then he runs out of 
the house (g-e'qEmx'it=chief rises against his face) to fetch his copper 
"to squelch with it the fire." The host proceeds at once to tie a cop- 
per to each of his house posts. If he-should not do so, the person who 
^refused the spoon would on returning strike the i)osts with the copper, 
which is considered equal to striking the chief's face (k'i'lxa). Then 
the man who went to fetch his copper breaks it and gives it to the host. 
This is called "squelching the host's fire." The host retaliates as 
described above. 

The following songs show the manner in which rivals scathe each 
other. 

First NEqa'pEnk'Em (=ten ftithom face) let his clan sing the follow- 
ing song at a feast which he gave: ^ 

1. Our great famous chief is known even ontside of our world, oh! he is the 
highest chief of all. [Then he sang:] The chiefs of all the tribes are my servants, 
the chiefs of all the tribes are my speakers. They are pieces of copper which I have 
broken. 

[The people:] Do not let our chief rise too high. Do not let him destroy too 
much property, else we shall be made like broken pieces of copper by the great 
breaker of coppers, the great splitter of coppers, the great chief who throws cop- 
pers into the water, the great one who can not be surpassed by anybody, the one 
surmounting all the chiefs. Long ago you went and burnt all the tribes to ashes. 
You went and defeated the chief of all the tribes; you made Lxs people run away 
and look for their relatives whom you had slain. You went and the fame of your 
power was heard among the northern tribes. You went and gave blankets to every- 
bodj-, chief of all tribes. 

2. Do not let us stand in frout of biia, of whom we are always hearing, even at 
the outermost limits of this world. Do not let us steal from our chief, tribes! else 
he will become enraged and will tie our hands. He will hang us, the chief of the 
tribes. 

[Ne(p"i'pKnk*Eni sings:] Do not mind my greatness. My tribe alone is as great 
as four tribes. I am standing on our fortress ; I am standing on top of the chiefs of 
the tribes. I am Copper Face, Great Mountain, Supporter, Obstacle; my tribes are 
my servants. 

At another feast he let his people sing:^ 

1. Do not look around, tribes! do not look arouiid, else we might see something 
that will hurt us in the great house of this really great chief. 



See Appendix, page 667. i See Appendix, page 668. 



356 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

2. ''Do not look arouud, tribes! do not look around, else we might see something 
formidable in the great house of this really great chief. His house has the 
Ts'o'noqoa.' Therefore we are benumbed and can not move. The house of our 
double chief,' of the really great chief, is taking our lives and our breath." 

3. "Do not make any noise, tribes! do not make any noise, else we shall precipi- 
tate a landslide of wealth from our chief, the overhanging mountain." 

4. [Neqa'pEuk-Em sings :] "I am the one from whom comes down and from whom is 
untied the red cedar bark^ for the chiefs of the tribes. Do not grumble, tribes! do 
not grumble in the house of the great double chief, who makes that all are afraid to 
die at his hands, over whose body is sprinkled the blood of all those who tried to 
eat in the house of the double chief,^ of the really great chief. Only one thing 
enrages me,' when people eat slowly and a little only of the food given by the great 
double chief." 

While these songs are merely a praise of the deeds of the singer, the 
following reply by He'nak-alaso, the rival of NEqa'pEnk-Em is bitter to 
the extreme. In it the singer ridicules him for not yet having returned 
a grease feast/' 

1. 1 thought another one was causing the smoky weather? I am the only one on 
earth — the only one in the world who makes thick smoke rise from the beginning • 
of the year to the end, for the invited tribes. •• 

2. What will my rival say again — that 'spider woman;' what will he pretend to 
do next? The words of that 'spider woman' do not go a straight way. Will ho not 
brag that he is going to give away canoes, that he is going to break coppers, that 
he is going to give a grease feast? Such will be the words of the 'spider woman,' 
and therefore your face is dry and moldy, you who are standing in front of the 
stomachs of the chiefs. 

3. Nothing will satisfy you; but sometimes I treated you so roughly that you 
begged for mercy. Do you know what you will be like? You will be like an old 
dog, and you will spread your legs before me when I get excited. You did so when I 
broke the great cop])ers ' Cloud ' and 'Making Ashamed,' my great property and the 
great coppers, 'Chief and 'Killer Whale,' and the one named 'Point of Island' and 
'The Feared One' and 'Beaver.' This I throw into your face, you Avhom I always 
tried to vanquish; Avhom I have maltreated; who does not dare to stand erect when 
I am eating; the chief whom even every weak man tries to vancxulsh. 

4. Now my feast! Go to him, the poor one who wants to be fed from the son of 
the chief whose own name is ' Full of Smoke' and 'Greatest Smoke.' Never mind; 
give him plenty to eat, make him drink until he will be qualmish and vomits. My 
feast steps over the fire right up to the chief. '^ 

In order to make the effect of the song still stronger, an effigy of the 
rival chief is sometimes placed near the fire. He is lean, and is repre- 
sented in an attitude as tliough begging tliat the fire be not made any 
hotter, as it is already scorching him (Plate 13). 

Property may not only be destroyed for the purpose of damaging the

6 Namely, by the fire of the grease feast. 

'' The first grease feast went as far as the center of the house. As NEqa'pEnk'Em 
did not return it, the second one stenned forward across the fire right up to him.

prestige of the rival, but also for the sole purpose of gaiuiug- distiuc- 
tion. This is done mainly at the time when houses are built, when 
totem poles are erected, or when a son has been initiated by the spirit 
presiding over the secret society of his clan, to which ceremony refer- 
ence has i)reviously been made. It 
seems that in olden times slaves were 
sometimes killed and buried under 
the house posts or under totem posts. 
Later on, instead of being killed, they 
were given away as presents. When- 
ever this was done, the inverted llgure 
of a man, or an inverted head, was 
placed on the pole. In other cases 
coppers were buried under the posts, 
or giva^n away. This custom still con- 
tinues, and in all such cases coj^pers 
are shown on the post, often in such 
a way that they are being held or 
bitten b}^ the totem 
animals (Plate 14). At 
the time of the initia- 
tion of a member of 
the clan slaves were 
also killed or coppers 
were destroyed, as 
will be described in 
greater detail later on. 
The property thus 
destroyed is called the 
o'mayu, the price paid 
for the house, the 
post, or for the initi- 
ation. 

The distribution or 
destruction of ju'op 
erty is not always 
made solely for the 
purpose of gaining 
prestige for one's self, 
but it is just as often 
made for the benefit of 
the successor to the 
name. In all such cases the latter stands during the festival next to the 
host, or, as the Indian terms it, in front of him, and the chief states that 
the property is distributed or destroyed for the one '• standing in front of 
him" (Lawu'hpime), which is therefore the term used for the chief's 
eldest son, or, in a more general sense, for the heir presumi^tive.

358 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

At all these festivals masks are occasionally worn which lepreseut 
the ancestor of the clan and refer to its legend. I will give one exam- 
ple: In the potlatch of the clan K"'kwri'kuni of the Q'o'nioyur', a mask 
representing one of the forefathers of the present clan (not their first 
ancestor), whose name was No'lis or Wa'tse appears, — a double mask, 
surmounted by a bear (fig. 5), The bear broke the dam which pre- 
vented the i)roperty of ISTo'lis going up the river. The outer mask 
shows No'lis in a state of rage vanquishing his rivals; the inner side 
shows him kindly disposed, distributing property in a friendly way. 
His song is as follows : ' 

1. A bear is standing at the river of tlie Wanderer who traveled all over the 

worul. 

2. Wild is the l)ear at the river of the Wanderer who traveled all over the world. 

3. A dangerous fish is going up the river. It will put a limit to the lives of the 

people. 

4. Ya! The sI'siuL- is going up the river. It will jiut a limit to the lives of the 

people. 

5. Great things are going up the river. It i« going up the river the copper of the 

eldest brother of our tribes. 

Another song used in these festivals is as follows:-' 

1. The heat of the chief of the tribes will not have mercy upon the people. 

2. The great lire of our chief in which stones < are glowing will not have mercy 

upou the people. 

3. You, my rival, will eat what is left over when I dance in my grease feast, when 

I, the chief of the tribes, perform the fire dance. 

4. Too great is, what you are doing, our chief. Who equals our chief! He is giv- 

ing feasts to the whole world. 

5. Certainly he has inherited from his father that he never gives a small feast to 

the lower chiefs, the chief of the tribes. 

The clan Haa/naLino have the tradition that their ancestor used the 
fabulous double-headed snake for his belt and boM^ In their potlatches 
the chief of the gens appears, therefore, dancing with a belt of this 
description and with a bow carved in the shape of the double-headed 
snake. The bow is simply a long carved and painted stick to which a 
string running through a number of rings and connecting with the 
horns and tongues of the snake is attached. When the string is pulled, 
the horns are erected and the tongues pulled out. When the string is 
slackened, the horns drop down and the tongues slide back again 
(Plate 15). 

IV". Marriage. 

Marriage among the Kwakiutl must be considered a purchase, which 
is conducted on the same principles as the purchase of a copper. But 
the object bought is not only the woman, but also the right of member- 
ship in her clan for the future children of the couple. I explained 

' See Appendix, page 670.

before that many privileges of the clau descend only througli marriage 
upon tbe son-in-law of the possessor, who, however, does not use them 
himself, but acquires them for the use of his successor. These privi- 
leges are, of course, not given as a present to the son-in-law, but he 
becomes entitled to them by paying a certain amount of property for 
his wife. The wife is given to him as a first installment of the return 
payment. The crest of the clan, its privileges, and a considerable 
amount of other property besides, are given later on, when the couple 
have children, and the rate of iuterest is the higher the greater the num- 
ber of children. For one child, 200 per cent of interest is paid; for 
two or more cliildren, 300 i^er cent. After this payment the marriage 
is annulled, because the wife's father has redeemed his daughter. If 
she continues to stay with her husband, she does so of her own free 
will (wulc'L, staying in the house for nothing). In order to avoid this 
state of affairs, the husband often makes a new payment to his father- 
in-law in order to have a claim to his wife. 

The law of descent through marriage is so rigid that methods have 
developed to prevent the extinction of a name when its bearer has no 
daughter. In such a case a man who desires to acquire the use of the 
crest and the other privileges connected with the name performs a 
sham marriage with the son of the bearer of the name (Xue/sa; Xew- 
ettee dialect : d;VxsitsEnt=taking hold of the foot). The ceremony is 
performed in the same manner as a real marriage. In case the bearer 
of the name has no children at all, a sham marriage with a part of his 
body is performed, with his right or left side, a leg or an arm, and the 
privileges are conveyed in the same manner as in the case of a real 
marriage. 

It is not necessary that the crest and privileges should be accjuired 
for the sou of the i)erson who married the girl, but they may be trans- 
ferred to his successor, whoever that may happen to be. 

As the acquisition of the crest and privileges connected with it 
play so important a part in the management of marriages, references 
to the clan traditions and dramatic performances of portions of the 
myth are of frequent occurrence, as may be seen from the following 
descriptions: 

I will describe first the marriage of a Ma'maleleqala Chief. 

jSTEmd'kulag-ilists'c called all the young men of all the tribes to 
come to his house. After a second call all the young men came. Then 
he arose and spoke: "Thank you, my brothers, for coming to my 
house. You know what is in my mind — that I want to marry to day. 
You know that I wanted you to come that I might ask my brothers to 
invite all the people. Xow dress yourselves; there is the paint and 
the eagl(5 down." 

The La'g-us arose and spoke: -'Yes, NEmo'kulag-ilists'c, these are 
your words. 1 and my friends will go now to make war upon the daugh- 
ters of all the chiefs all over the world. Now take care, my friends! 



360 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

young chiefs of all the tribes; paint yourselves and put doAvn on your 
heads." Then the young- men painted themselves and put down on 
their heads, and went out to the north end of the village. First they 
went into the house of Hii'masaqa. As soon as they had entered 
they all said, "Listen!" and La/g-us spoke: "Hear me, tribes! go and 
help to bring my bride into my house." Here he stopped, and one of 
the men living in the house said: "We will do so." Now they went 
from house to house and spoke in the same way. Then they all went 
back into the house of XEmo'kalag-ilists'*"'. Then they Avent at once 
to call the tribes, and they all came. Now Walas NEmo'gwis spoke: 
"Come, chiefs of all the tribes, to hear the words of our chief. We 
will make war upon the tribes. Something great is in the door of the 
house of our future wife. That is all." Then Walas NEmo'gwis 
counted the blankets and the counters kept tally. When 200 were 
counted, he said: "We pay for our wife these 200 blankets here." 
Then he counted 100 blankets more, and said : "With these 100 blan- 
kets we will lift her. We must lift a heavy weight for the son of 
La'lawig-ila." All the men replied: "True, true are your words, chief." 
Walas NEmo'gwis counted 100 blankets more, and said: "These are 
intended for calling our wife. Wa, chiefs ! there are 400 blankets here, 
by means of which we are trying to get the daughter of La'lawig-ila." 

Then Hr*' Lamas arose and spoke: "Yes, son, your speech is good. 
All our tribes heard what you said. Now take care, else a mistake 
might be made. Thus I say, chiefs of all the tribes. Now arise, 
T:ri/(jr)Las, and you, Ma/Xmawisaqamae, and yon, Ya/qaLEulis, and you, 
Ma/Xuayalits'e; we want to go to war now. Now ask if it is all 
right." They gave them each a single blanket to wear. Then these 
four men arose and went to the house of La'lawig-ila. They sat down 
in the doorway, and la/qoLas spoke: "We come, chief, to ask you 
about this marriage. Here are 400 blankets ready for you. Now we 
are ready to take our wife. That is all." 

Then spoke Lfi'lawig-ila: "Call my future son-in-law, that he may 
come for his wife; but let him stay on the beach. You all shall stay 
there; only the blankets shall come into my house." Then Y'a/qaLEnlis 
spoke: " Thank yon. Chief, for your words. Now let us tell our chief." 
Then they went to tlie house of NEmo'kulag-ilists'r'. They Mcnt in, and 
T:a/qoLas told the answer of La/lawig-ila to the chiefs of all the tribes, 
saying: "He told us to come soon to take our wife." Then all the 
young men took the blankets. They put them on the shouldt-r of other 
young men and all walked out. They put the blankets down on the 
beach. Then Hc'Lamas arose and spoke: "All the tribes came; I 
came, La'lawig-ila, to take from your arms your daughter to be my 
wife. Now count the blankets which we brought." 

Then Walas NEmo'gwis arose. He took the blankets and spoke: 
"Y'es, chiefs of all the tribes, I am not ashamed to tell about these 
blankets. My grandfather was a rich man. Therefore I am not 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 361 

ashamed to speak." "True, true!" said all the men, "who would gaiu- 
say it. Chief!" Walas NEuio'gwis counted the blankets. When five 
pairs of blankets were counted, he put them on the shoulder of one of 
the four men, who carried them into the house of La'lawig'ila. Thus 
they did until 200 blankets were counted and carried into the house. 
He said: "With these blankets they are married. Now we will try to 
lift our wife from the lioor." He took the blankets and said: "With 
these we lift her from the tloor." He counted again five pairs, put 
them on the shoulder of one of the young men, who carried them into 
the house, until 100 were counted. Then Walas NEuio'gwis said: 
" There are 100, as we told you, chiefs ! Now we will call our wife." 
He took a blanket and said: " We call her with these," and counted in 
the same manner as before. When 100 blankets had been counted, he 
said : " There are 100 blankets here." When the four men had carried 
all into the house of La'lawig-ila, he came out and said: " That is what 
1 wished for. All the tribes came to marry my daughter. Let my son- 
in law hear it. He shall come into my house if his heart is strong 
enough, wa wa!" As soon as his speech was finished, eight men 
brought burning torches of cedarwood. Four stood on the right hand 
side of the door and four on the left-hand side. They i^ut the burning 
ends of the torches close together, just wide enough apart for a man to 
pass through. 

Now Ma'Xua arose. He was to x>ass through the fire. He ran up 
to it, but as soon as he came near it, he became afraid and turned back. 
Now he called NEuio'kulag-ilists'e : " Hear it ! his heart must be strong 
if he wants to accomplish what I attempted in vain." NEmokula- 
g-ilists'e arose and said : " Yes, Ma'Xua, your word is true. Now look 
out, chiefs ! else we shall not get my wife and I shall be ashamed of it. 
That is the legend which my father told me, how the daughter of 
Nu'nemasEqu was married at x^a'Saxsdalis. A fire was at the door of 
her house. Now arise, La/LiliLa, take two pairs of blankets and give 
them to him wliose heart is strong, else our friends will try in vain to 
get my wife." Then La'LiliLa arose, took the blankets and carried 
them to Wrdas NEmo'gwis, who spoke: "Tribes ! Let him whose heart 
is strong go up to that honse. These two x>airs of blankets are for him 
who will go there." Then Ma'Xuag-ila the Koskimo arose and spoke: 
"I am not frightened. I am LE'lpela. This name comes from the oldest 
legend. He knew how to jump into the fire. Now I will go, you beat 
the boards!" As soon as the men began to beat the boards he ran up 
to the fire, and although the torches were close together, he ran through 
them into the house. He was not hurt. When he got into the house, 
NEmo'kulag-ilists'e said : "Ho, ho, ho, ho. He has succeeded ! Thank 
you, my tribe." As soon as MaXuag-ila had entered the house the fire 
disappeared. LiVLawig-ila came out and spoke: "Come now and take 
your wife, son in-law!" They brought out blankets and Lfi'Lawig-ila 
said : "Now I give you a small gift, son-in-law. Sell it for food. There 



362 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

are 200 blankets." Tlien Walas N"Emo'gwis arose: "Dou't sit down, 
tribes. Let us sing a song of joy! Take care, duel's of tbe Ma'inale- 
leijala, we will make fun of the Kwakiutl. My chief has again given 
blankets. The name of my tribe is Ma'malcleqala, who vanquish all. 
I am feared by all the tribes. T can not be lifted. I know bow to buy 
great coppers. I make chiefs out of poor men. Whenever I give 
away blankets, I do so in Tsa'xis on account of the legend of Ma/lele- 
qala, who was tirst transformed into a man at this place." 
Thus spoke Walas NEmo'gwis and all arose and sang: 

1. The deer went on tlie water, and tried to make war on his younger brother. 

2. KuOkuaxa'oc gave up the chase, trying to make war on his younger brother. 

3. Only I do this way. Only I am the great one avIio takes away the daughter of 

chiefs, the younger brother of Kurknaxa'of-. 

When they stopped singing, NEmo'kulag'ilists'e said, ''Ho, ho, ho, 
ho," and he i)romised to give away blankets. He said: "These are 
blankets for you, Gue'tEla; blankets for you, Q'd'moyue; blankets for 
you, Walas Kwakiutl; blankets for you, Q'o'mk-iitis. They belong 
to TLil/qoaqa, the daughter of ^Emo'kulag-ilists'e," and he said, "]!Tow 
go to take my wife and the blankets." 

Then the men went to the house of La/lawig-ila, and after a short 
time they came back. Ts'a'ts'alkoalis, his daughter, was among them. 
Then all the men went home. He did not give away the blankets at 
once. She went to live with her husband. 

Here is the description of another marriage: The successor of Ma'Xua, 
chief of the Gua'ts'enox, was engaged to marry He'nEdemis, daughter 
of Ya'qaLasame, chief of the Qo'sqemuX. Then Ma'Xua sent four 
men — Kasa'lis, A'wite, NEme'mrdas, and Ya/.8ide — to ask if Ya'qaLa- 
same agreed to the marriage. As soon as the four men entered his 
house, Kasa'lis spoke: "I come, chief! sent to you by the son of Ma'Xua. 
He has 400 blankets ready to be given to you to buy in marriage your 
daughter, and also to take home your daughter, Ya'qaLasame. We 
beg of you, O, Chief! to bend your heart to our wishes, for you have 
nothing to complain of. We all are of one descent. We are sent by 
your uncle, chief, and by your great-grandson, the successor to Ma'Xua. 
Thus I say, NEme'mfilas. Now we have said our speech, A'wite, Ya'Side. 
Xow, xl'wite, you speak to our uncle here." Then A'wite spoke: '-Let 
me speak next, Kasa'lis. I came, sent as a messenger by your uncle. 
Let us try to get our relative. Xow, Ya'Side, you speak next." He 
said: "I am the double-headed snake.^ There is nothing in the world 
that I am unable to obtain. Now move your tongue, and give us an 
answer." 

Then Ya'ciaLasame s[)oke: "You have finished your speeches that 
you were to deliver to me, chiefs of the Gua'ts'enox. Only let your 
tribe take care, A'wito. Now you may have my danghter. Come here 
to-morrow, but strengthen your hearts. Now go and tell Chief Ma'Xua 

' See page 371. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 363 

that I will show my legend — the lire in the house. If you do not run 
away from the heat of my lire, you may have my daughter. Now go, 
masters !'- 

Then the lour men left the house. They went and reported the 
words of Ya'qaLasame to Ma'Xua, who ijrayed his tribe not to fear 
the fire. 

As soon as they had left, Ya'qaLasame carved a large mask repre- 
senting the ''Sea Bear," the mouth of which opened, and attached it 
to a bearskin which his dancer was to wear. Then lie took a basket 
and went to the graveyard, where he took seven skulls and other bones, 
which he carried home in his basket. Then he opened the mouth of the 
bear mask and put the skulls and the other bones into it. Next he 
prepared the seats for Ma/Xua and his friends close to the fireplace. 
He poured several bottles of grease into a wooden box and built uj) a 
high pyre, on top of which he placed the box containing the grease. 

On the following day Ma/Xua called his tribe, and all prepared to go 
to Ya'qaLasame's house. When they entered, Ma'Xua said: '-Now be 
very careful, my tribe! Do not forget how kindly I feel toward all of 
you. If ever you ask me to help you, I do not spurn you, but I feel 
l)roud of your kind feeling toward me. Now chiefs! A'wite, and you, 
NEme'mrdas, and you, Ya'Side, do for me as I have done toward you. 
I fear he will show his great fire, then let us take care, my tribe ! The 
first Gua'ts'enox were never afraid; they never fied from anything. 
Therefore we, our present generation, must not fear anything, wa!" 

Then Y'^iVgide spoke: "Let us stand by our chief, Gua'ts'enox! Let 
us stand by our chief! The name Ma/Xua comes from the time long 
before our grandfathers. Now our generation is living. Take care, 
Ma/Xua, and you, my grandson, jrja/gaxidalaLe, for the people of our 
tribe have seen your kind heart, wa!" 

Then they loaded four canoes with the blankets, for it is a long way 
from the village of the Gua'ts'enox to that of the Qd'sqemuX. They 
paddled, and when they arrived at the village of the Qo'sqemuX, 
A'wite arose in the canoe and said: "Now, show yourselves, Qo'sqi- 
muX ! 1 am of the Gua'ts'enoX tribe and come to get He'uEdemis, the 
daughter of your chief, Ya'qaLasame, as wife for my grandson, x)a'.§axi- 
dalaLe. Now, XEg-e'tse ami A'wite, count the blankets!" Now they 
counted the blankets. As soon as there Avere five pairs of blankets, 
A'wite said: "Ten J am paying for my wife," and when another five 
pairs were counted, he said so again, and so on until all the blankets 
were counted. Then Ya'qaLasame went out of the house and said: 
"Come, Gua'ts'enox, come up from the beach into my house." Then 
they all went ashore and entered Ya'qaLasame's house. When all were 
in, Goax-i'lats'e spoke: "Welcome, Gua'ts'enox ! Come, Ma/Xua; come, 
Ya'gide; come,XEme'malas; come, A'wite; come, Ka'salis. Thank you 
for coming. Chief L'E'nk-alas. Now take care, Gua'ts'enox, for here is 
the Q'o'moqoa, a sea monster, who swallows everything, and there in 



364 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

the rear of the house is he who devoured everyoue who tried to marry 
the daughter of Ya'qaLasame, and this fire has hurt everyoue who 
tried to marry He/uEdemis. Now, Chief Ya'qaLasame, light your fire 
and let the chief get our daughter here." 

Then Ya'qaLasame lit the fire and all the Gua'ts'enox sat down 
close to it. When the fire was burning, Ya'qaLasame spoke: "Now 
take care, Gua'ts'enox, for I intend to try you. You said you were not 
afraid of Ts'd'noqoa ? Now I will try all of you, chiefs of the Gua'ts'enox. 
On account of this fire nobody can get my daughter." 

When the grease began to burn, all the Gua'ts'enox lay down on their 
backs and their blankets were scorched. Now the fire died out, and 
then Kasfi'lis spoke: "Ya, Qo'sqenuiX ! This is my way. I am afraid 
of nothing-. Even if you should begin to murder us, I should not run 
away. Now, Gua'ts'enox, we have our wife. Here, Chief Ya'qaLa- 
same ! Look at our blankets which we are giving you." Then Ya'qaLa- 
same spoke: '-Chiefs of the Gua'ts'enox, I have seen you are really a 
savage people, and everyone fears you. I am afraid of you, for you 
are the first ones who have not run away from my fire. If you had 
run away, you would not have obtained my daughter for your wife." 
Then he shouted: "Take her, Gua'ts'enox! Now you, devourer of all 
tribes, step forward, that Ma'Xua and Jc)a'.T^axidalaLe may see who has 
eaten the suitors of my daughter. Now look, NEme'mrdas; look, 
A'wite; look, Ya'gide; and you, Kasa'lis, and see the devourer of the 
tribes." Then Ya'qaLasame took a pole and poked the stomach of the 
devourer of the tribes who had come forward. Then the mask vom- 
ited the seven skulls and the other bones and Ya'qaLasame continued: 
"Now look at it, Gua'ts'enox. These are the bones of the suitors 
who came to marry my daughter and who ran away from my fire. The 
devourer of tribes ate them. That is what he vomited. Now come, 
He'uEdemis, and go to your husband!" 

Then she came and went into the canoe of the Gua'ts'enox. They 
all went into the canoe and returned home. 

I will give still another example, namely, the marriage ceremony of 
the L'a'sq'enox, which is founded on the following tradition : A chief of 
the L'a'sq'enox speared a sea otter which pulled his canoe out to sea. 
He tried to cut the line, but it stuck to the canoe. Finally the moun- 
tains of his country went out of sight. After a long time he saw a 
black beach, and when he came near, he saw that it was the place where 
all the coal of fires goes when it drifts down the northward current of 
the sea. He passed this place and came to the place where all the dry 
sand is drifting- to and fro. The sea otter continued to pull him on, and 
he arrived at the place where the down (of birds) is drifting- on the 
water. He passed those and came to the place where the toilet sticks' 
are going. Finally he discovered a village on a beach. The sea otter 
jumped ashore and was transformed into a man, who entered the chiefs

house. The chief's speaker invited the mau to euter, and asked him 
what he wanted. The person who sees peoples' thoughts sat to the 
right of the door and said : " He comes to get a magical treasure." Then 
the chief of the sea otter, for it was ho whose house he had entered, 
gave him a harpoon and said : "You will be the chief of the world. Do 
you want anything elsef "Yes," replied the man, " I want to marry 
your dauiihter." She was sitting on a platform in the rear of the house. 
He married her, and the chief gave him four men to show him the way 
home. The girl's names were Tse'saqa (sea otter pup woman) and 
G*a'laxa-is (first to receive gifts). When they approached the village of 
the L'a'sq'enox, Tse'saqa commanded her husband to tlirow the mau who 
was sitting in the bow of the canoe into the water. He made him lay off 
his mask and threw him into the water. His name was Xa'ya'la (sound 
of stones rolling on the beach). Then the sea began to roll in heavy 
waves. The woman ordered him to throw the three other men into the 
water. He did so, and they 
were tranformed into three 
islands, which protect the 
beach of the L'a'sq'euox 
village. Since that time the 
L'a'sq'enox use four masks 
representing these men iu 
their marriages. 

Tlie bridegroom's tribe go 
in canoes to the girl's liouse. 
When they arrive iu front of 
her house, four old men who 
wear the masks representing 
the four men referred to stej) 
ashore. They walk four steps 
and then perform a dance. 
They look at the girl's tribe 
and point toward the house as though directing their friends. Then 
they go back into the canoe and take their masks oft'. Figure 6 rep- 
resents the mask of Xa'ya'la. I have not seen the three other masks 
belonging to the ceremony. The broad band on top of the mask repre- 
sents the head ornament of cedar bark which Xa'ya'la is said to have 
worn. The four men receive in payment of their dance a blanket each 
from the bridegroom. 

At this place I can describe only a portion of the ceremonial pre- 
scribed for the return of the purchase money and the delivery of the 
crest to the son-in-law, as it is in most cases performed as a part of the 
winter ceremonial and must be treated in connection with the latter 
subject. (See p. 421.) The return of the purchase money is called 
qaute'x-a, and the particular manner of return, which will be described 
here, LEUE'mXs'a. 

The people are all invited to assemble in the house of the wife's father.

366 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

When all the guests liave assembled, tbe father-in law of the youug man 
enters, accompanied by his clan. Four of them are carrying the mast 
of a canoe, one holding it at the top, another one at the butt, and two 
at intermediate x)oints. They walk to the right and stand on the right- 
hand side of the door on the front side of the house, facing the middle.' 
Then the wife's father calls his son-in law, who steps forward and stands 
in the right-hand rear corner of the house. The other speaker tells 
him that the mast represents lids of boxes (g-i'sExstala, see p. 421) tied 
together (LEuk"), and that they contain everything that he owes his 
son-in law. The latter replies, asking if the coppers, house, its posts, 
and his father-in-law's names are in it also. Even if the old man should 
not have intended to give all of this, he must comply with this demand 
and promise to give it all to his soniu-law. ISText, the young man's wife 
is sent by her father to fetch the copper. She returns, carrying it on 
her back, and the young men of her clan bring in blankets, AH of this 
is given to the young man, who proceeds at once to sell the copper oft- 
hand. This is called "holding the copper at its forehead" (da/g-iue). 
In such a case less than one-half of the actual ])rice is i)aid for the 
copper. If it is worth 0,000 blankets, it will bring only 2,500 blankets. 
The buyer must pay the price on the spot, and the blankets which the 
young man obtains in this manner are distributed by him right away. 
By this distribution he obtains the right to live in the house which his 
father-in-law has given to him. 

Although in most marriages the house and name of the bride's father 
are promised to be transferred to the young man, this is not necessarily 
the case. The dower agreed upon may consist only of coppers, canoes, 
blankets, and the like. 

I learned about a curious instance how a man punished his father-in- 
law who had long delayed the return of the purchase-money and was 
evidently evading the duty of giving up his name and home to his son- 
in-law. The latter carved an image representing his wife and invited 
all the people to a feast. Then he put a stone around the neck of the 
image and threw it into the sea. Thus he had destroyed the high rank 
of his wife and indirectly tliat of his father-in-law. 

V. The Clan LectEnds. 

It appears from what has been said before that, in order to fully 
understand the various ceremonies, it is necessary to be familiar with 
the clan legends. Tn the following chapter I will give a selection of 
legends which will make clear their counection with the carvings used 
by each clan and the ceremonials performed on various occasions. 

It seems desirable to introduce at this place a fuller description of 

'The positions in the liouse are always given according to the Indian method: 
The lire is tlie outer side (Lil'sak), the walls the back side (a'La). Thus right and left 
are always to be considered the corresponding sides of a person who is looking toward 
the fire from the front or rear of the house.

tlie plan of the house than has heretofore been given. The houses of 
the Kwakiutl form a square, the sides of wliich are from 40 to 60 feet 
long. (Figs. 7 and 8.) The door (D) is generally in the center of the 
side nearest the sea, which forms the front of the house. The latter 
has a gable roof, the ridge of which runs from the front to the rear. 
The walls consist of boards, which are fastened to a framework of poles. 
The sides of the door are formed by two posts (A) from G to 8 inches in 
diameter and standing about 4 feet apart. Over the door they are cou-

nected by a crossbar (B). (Fig. 8.) Sometimes the framework of the 
door is made of heavy planks. The framework of the house front con- 
sists of two or three vertical poles (C), about 3 inches in diameter, on 
each side of the door. They are from 8 to 10 feet apart. Their length 
diminishes toward the sides of the house according to the inclination of 
the roof. These poles are connected by long crossbars (E), which are 
tied to their outer side with ropes of cedar bark at half the distance 
between the roof and the grouiul. The framework of the rear part is 
similar to that of the front, but that of the sides is far stronger, as it 



368 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



lias to support the roof. Two heavy posts (F), about 9 inches in diam- 
eter, are erected. Their heads are cut out and a beam of the same 
diameter is hiid over them. At the joints it is cut out so as to lit into 
the heads of the posts. On both sides of the door and in the corre- 
sponding part of the rear side, about 3 feet distant from the central 
line of the house, the supports (U) of the roof are erected. These form 
the princij^al i^art of the framework, and are the first to be made when 
the house is built. They stand about 3 feet from the wall, inside the 
house. These uprights are about 2 feet in diameter and are generally 
connected by a crosspiece (G) of the same diameter. On each side of 
the crosspiece rests a heavy beam (H), which runs from the front to the 
rear of the liouse. 




Fi;;. S. 

ELEVATION AND SECTION OF KWAKIUTL HOUSE. 

Sometimes these beams are supported by additional uprights (U'), 
which stand near the center of the house. The rafters (R) are laid 
over these heavy timbers and the beams forming the tops of the sides. 
They are about 8 inches in diameter. Light poles about 3 inches thick 
are laid across the rafters. They rest against the vertical poles (C) in the 
front aiul rear of the house. After the heavy framework which supports 
the central part of the roof is erected, a bank about 3 feet in height is 
raised all around the outlines of the house, its outer side coinciding 
with the lines where the walls are to be erected. Long, heavy boards 
4 or 5 inches thick are implanted lengthwise along the front of the 
house, their upper edges standing 2i or 3 feet above the ground. Then 
the earth forming the bank is stamped against them, and thus a 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 369 

platform is made running along the front of the house. Later on this 
is continued all around the house. The framework of the front is the 
next to be erected. The poles (C) stand in the dirt forming the plat- 
form. The upper edges of the front boards which were implanted into 
the ground are grooved, and in this groove the boards forming the 
front wall stand. They are tied or nailed to the crossbar (E) and to the 
foremost rafter, which is connected with the framework of the front. 
The next thing to be done is to make the rear wall and the sides. The 
former exactly corresponds to the front, the door only being wanting. 
The boards forming the side walls are implanted in the ground, stand- 
ing vertically, their ui^per ends being tied to the beam forming the top 
of the framework. The platform running along the inner sides of the 
walls is iinished by stamping the earth against the side walls. The 
roof consists of a peculiar kind of boards, which run from the gable to 
the sides of the house. They lap on their edges like Chinese tiles. 
This arrangement has the effect that the rain runs from the roof with- 
out penetrating into the house. The house front is generally finished 
by cutting the boards off along the roof and by finishing them off with 
a molding. A few logs are placed in front of the door, forming steps 
(T) that lead to the platform. Steps of the same kind lead from the 
platform to the floor of the house. The board forming the inner side 
of the platform slopes slightly inward. The house has no smoke 
escape, but several of the boards forming the roof can be pushed aside. 
During the night these openings are closed, but in the morning one 
board over every fireplace is pushed aside by means of a long pole. 
As it is necessary to look after the roof from time to time, a stationary 
ladder is leaned against the side of the house. It consists of one-half 
of the trunk of a tree or of a heavy board, into the upper side of which 
steps are cut. 

The house is inhabited by several families, each of whom has a fire- 
place of its own. The corners belonging to each family are divided off 
from the main room by a rough framework of poles, the top of which 
is used for drying fish or other sorts of food. On each side of the fire 
stands the immense settee (fig. 11), which is large enough for the whole 
fiimily. It has no feet, is about 7 feet long and 4 feet deep, and its sides 
slope slightly backward, so as to form a convenient support for the 
back. Boards are laid along the base of the rear and front platform and 
on the side of the fire opposite the settee. The arrangement is some- 
times made a little different, the settee being wanting, or in some 
instances standing on the rear side. Often long boards are placed 
edgewise near the fire, serving as a back support. They are supported 
by plugs which are rammed into the floor and lean slightly backward, 
thus forming a convenient back support. The bedrooms have the form 
of small houses which are built on the platform running around the 
house. Most of these bedrooms have gable roofs, and their fronts 
are finished off with moldings. The section c-d (fig. 8) explains the

arraugement better tlian any description can do. Sometimes these 
rooms are enlarged by adding a low extension to tlie house, the floor 
of which is elevated as high as the platform. In the center of such 

rooms there is a small fire- 



place. The plans of the 
houses of the separate 
gentes show slight differ- 
ences. In some instances 
the heavy beams (H) rest on 
the uprights (U), the cross- 
piece (G) being wanting 
(fig. 9). In other instances 
there is only a single timber 
resting on the crossi)iece 
(Gr). When festivals are 
celebrated, all the parti- 
tions, seats, and tires are 
removed, and one large tire 
is built in the center of the 
house. For such occasions 
the floor is carefully leveled 
and swept. Each liouse has 
its name, as will be seen 
from the view of the village of Xumta'sp«l (fig. -JO, p. 391), in which the 
names of four of the houses are given. In front of the village the 
bight Okuiua'Le is seen, bounded by the narrow point La'sota, on 
which the natives grow some potatoes in a small inclosure. Behind

The houses generally face the beach and are built in a row. (See fig. Ii6, 
p. 391.) In front of the town there is a street, which is carefully leveled, 
the lower side being- su})ported by an embankment of heavy logs. From 
here steps lead down to the beach, where the canoes are lying. Oppo-

site to the houses, on the side of the street toward the sea, there are 
platforms; summer seats, on which the Indians pass most of their time, 
gambling and conversing. The platform rests on a framework of poles 
and on the embankment of the street, as shown in fig. 2C. 

I iH'oceed now to a discussion of the clan legends. 

First of all, it is necessary to describe and enumerate a number of 
supernatural beings who may become the supernatural helpers of man, 
as they appear over and 
over again in the clan 
legends. Besides a num- 
ber of animals, such as 
wolves, bears, sea lions, 
and killer whales, which, 
however, do not play a 
very important part as 
protectors of man, we 
find principally a num- 
ber of fabulous monsters 
whose help was obtained 
by the ancestors, and 
who therefore have 
become the crest of the 
clan. 

Perhaps the most 
important among these is the si'siuL, the ftibulous double-headed 
snake, which has one head at each end, a human head in the middle, 
one horn on each terminal head, and two on the central human 
head. (Fig. 10.) It has the power to assume the shape of a fish. 
To eat it and even to touch or to see it is sure death, as all the 
joints of the unforlunate one become dislocated, the head being 
turned backward. But to those who enjoy supernatural help it may

bring power; its blood, wherever it touches the skin, makes it as 
hard as stone; its skin used as a belt enables the owner to per- 
form wonderful feats; it may become a canoe which moves by the 
motions of the si'siuL tins; its eyes, when used as sling stones, kill 

even whales. It is essentially the helper of 
warriors. 

I give here a few forms in which the sI'siuL 
is represented (figs. 11, 12. See also, figs. 
16G-109, pp. 514, 515, Plate 15>. In fig. 
12 only one-half of the 
sI'siuL is shown. The ter- 
minal head, with its horn 
laid backward, is plainly 
seen. The upi)er line be- 
hind the head designates 
the body, from which down- 
ward and forward extends 
one leg, the foot of which 
is quite clear. One of the 
central horns is shown 
over the ])oint of attachment of the leg. 

Another being which figures largely in the clan 
legends of the Kwakiutl is the Ts'o'noqoa, a wild 
woman who resides in the woods. She is re^ire- 
sented as having enormous breasts and as carry- 
ing a basket, into which she puts children whom 
she steals in order to eat them. Her eyes are 
hollow and shine with a wild luster. She is asleep 
most of the time. Her mouth is pushed forward, 
as she is, when awake, constantly uttering her cry, 
"i\, hu, fi, u." This figure belongs to a great many 
clan legends, and is often represented on house posts 
or on masks (figs. 13, 14). 

The following tradition describes this spirit quite 
fully: 

The first of the L'a'sq'enox lived at XauX. On 
the one side of the river lived the clan Wi'sEuts'a. 
One day the children went across the river to play 
there. They maiie a house of fir bran(;hes and played 
in it. One of the boys went out of the house and 
he discovered a giantess who was approaching the 
house. He told his friends, who came running 
out of the house. The giantess was chewing gum 
which was as red as blood. The children wanted to have some 
of the 'gum. Then she called them and gave them some. They 
asked her: "Where do you get your gumf" "Come," she replied,

"I will poiut it out to you." Then the children crept into the basket 
which she can ied on her back and she went into the woods. She was 
Ao'xLaax (or Ts'o'noqoa). She carried them far into the woods. Then 
she put the gum on their eyes and carried them to her house. She was 
a cannibal. Among the children were two sons of the chief of the 
Wi'sEnts'a; Lo'pEk-'axstEliL ' was the name of the chief. His wife was 
LE'wag-ilaynqoa. Then she cried, and sometimes she would blow her 
nose and throw the mucus on the ground. Suddenly she discovered a 
little boy lying on his back on the floor. He had originated from the 
mucus of her nose. She took the boy up and carried him into the house. 
He grew very quickly ; after four days he was quite strong. Then he 
asked for a bow and two arrows. Now he was called LE'ndEqoayats'E- 
waL. When he had received his bow and arrows, LE'wag-ilayuqoa 
asked him not to go across the river, but he did so against her re- 
quest. He followed the trail which he found ou the other side. He 
came to a house and entered. There he saw children sitting on the floor, 
and a woman named E'o'pEk-'axstEliL, who was rooted to the floor. The 
latter spoke: "Don't stay long, Chief ! She is gone after water; if she 
should come back, she will kill you." Then he went out and followed the 
trail. All of a sudden he saw the Ts'o'noqoa coming. She carried a 
bucket in each hand. The little boy climbed a tree, in order to hide in 
its branches. The Ts'o'noqoa saw his image in the water and made love 
to liim. She looked up and discovered him. Then she called him to 
come down. Now he came down to her and that woman asked him : 
"How does it happen that you look so pretty?" The boy said: " I put 
my head between two stones." She replied: "Then I will take two 
stones too." He sent her to fetch two stones and soon she came back 
carrying them. She put them down. The boy said: "Now lie down 
on your back." Then the boy put the one stone under her head and 
told her to shut her eyes. Then he took the other stone and dropped 
it as hard as he could ou her head. Her head was smashed and her 
brains were scattered. She was dead. The boy broke her bones with 
the stones and threw them into the water. Then he went into her 
house. As soon as he had entered, the woman who was rooted to the 
floor said: "Now do not stay long. I know that you have tried to 
kill the Ts'o'noqoa. It is the fourth time that somebody tried to kill 
her. She never dies; she has nearly come to life. There in that cov- 
ered hemlock branch (knothole?) is her life. Go there, and as soon as 
you see her enter shoot her life. Then she will be dead." She had 
hardly finished speaking when the Ts'o'noqoa came in, singing as she 
walked: 

I have the magical treasure, 

I have the superuatural power, 

I can return to life. 

That was her song. Then the boy shot at her life. She fell dead to the 
floor. Then the boy took her and threw her into the hole in which she

appears farther ou as that of a woman living in the Ts'O'noqoa's house.

was going to roast tlie children. He washed their eyes with urine and 
took them home to XanX. They Avere all alive again. Then LE'ndE- 
qoayats'EwaL went back to heaven. 

Of less frequent occurrence is the s^iirit of th esea, Q'o'mrxioa, the 
protector of the seals, who kills hunters. There are a number of tales 
relating how he took the ancestor of a tribe to the bottom of the sea 
and gave him his crest. I will give here a legend of the clan (r*exsEin, 
of the La'Lasiqoala, which shows how they came into the possession of 
the Q'o'moqoa carving : 0"meaL, the Raven, the ancestor of the clan 
G-e'xsEm, had a daughter named Ha/taqa. One day the crow, who was 
0"meaL's sister, and Ha'taija went down to the beach to gather sea 
urchins. Soon they had filled their baskets. The crow carried them 
into the woods, broke the shells, and prepared them. Then she offered 
some to Ha/taqa, who refused them, for fear of her fiither. The crow, 
however, promised that he would not tell on her, and prompted Ha'tacja 
to eat of the sea urchins. She had hardly begun to eat when the crow 
jumped upon a log of driftwood, shouting, "Qax, qax. qax, qax! 
HiVtaqa is stealing sea urchins." Ha/taqa asked her, "Please stop, and 
I will give you my blanket." The crow, however, did not cease shout- 
ing, although Ha/taqa offered her her bracelets of abalone shells. But 
already 0"meaL had heard what the crow said. He was enraged, and 
ordered his tribe to load their canoes and to extinguish the fires. Then 
he and his whole tribe left Hri/ta({a all alone in the deserted village. 
Ha/taqa's grandmother, however, had pity upon the girl, and before 
she left she had hidden some fire in a shell. A dog and a bitch were 
the only living beings that were left in the village besides Ha'tac^a. 
As soon as the canoes were out of sight, the dog, by dint of scratching 
and howling, attracted her attention to the shell. She found the glow- 
ing embers and started a fire. She built a hut of cedar twigs, in which 
she lived with her dogs. The following morning she sent them into the 
woods and ordered them to fetch withes. They obeyed, and Ha'taqa 
made four fish baskets. At low water she jdaced them on the beach, 
and at the next tide she found them full of fish. But on looking more 
closely she discovered a man in pne of them, Aik'a'a'yolisana, the son 
of Q'o'nioqoa. He came from out of tlie basket, carrying a small 
box. He said to her, "Carry this small box to your house. I came 
to marry you." Although the box was small, Ha'taqa was unable 
to lift it, and he had to carry it himself When he arriv^ed in front of 
the house, he opened it, and, behold! a whale was in it. Aik-a'a/yoli- 
sana built a large house and married Ha'tacpx. Then he invited all 
the tribes and distributed the whale meat. His descendants use his 
mask (fig. 15), and when it is shown, sing as follows: 

It is a tale ■wliicli came down to us from Ibe beginning of the world. 
Yon came up, bringing the house ofQ'o'moqoa, you "Growing rich," 
"Wealth coming ashore," "Covered with wealth," "Mountain of property." 
"Really great Mountain." It i.s a tale which came down to us I'rom the beginning 
of the world.'

"Whatever the tradition oi" the clau may be, the figures with which 
house and iiuplenients are ornamented refer to this legend. I am not 
familiar with all the legends, which often are quite trivial, merely stating 
that the ancestor met such and such a being. I give here a number of 
figures, which will illustrate the connection between the clan legend and 
the ornamentation of various objects. Fig. IG shows the house front of 
the clan G°e'xsEm of the La'i.asiqoala. It represents the thunder bird 
S(iuatting over the door, and 
the sun at each side. While 
the former belongs to the 
G-e'xsEm, tlie sun Avas ob- 
tained from the clan (}'d'm- 
k-utis of the (loasi'la. Fig.

the clan G-i'g'ilqam of the 
same tribe. The bears on 
each side of the door are the 
crest of this clan, which was 
obtained by their ancestor

crest of the mother of the house owner, who belonged to the Goasi'la tribe. 
It represents the moon, G-a/loyaqamc (=the very first one), and inside 
the ancestor of the clan, LE'lnakulag-ilak-as'd, who was takeji up to the 
moon by G-a/loyaqame. The feet of this figure are drawn like frog'sfeet,

tliuuder bird lifting a whale, which is its food, from out of the water. 
According to the clau tradition, the G'i'g-ilqam are the descendants of 
the thunder bird. This house front was excellently painted, but has been 
whitewashed, owing to the misplaced zeal of a missionary. The beak 
was carved and fastened to the house front. The owner had one of his 
coppers tied to the pole on ton of the house. In fig. 20 is shown a house 
post which represents a sea lion. I was not able to learn to what clan it 
belongs. It is found in a house at Xumta'spe with the post shown in fig. 
36, p. 414. The owner belongs to the clan G-e'xsEm, of theNaqo'mg-ilisala. 
The carving is said to have come from Yil'qaL'uala (Hope Island), which 
is the territory of the La'Lasiqoala. When the Naqo'mg-ilisala moved 
to the present village of Newettee they brought it with them. Fig. 
19, which represents a statue in a house at Xumta'spe, has a curious

explanation. It belongs to the subdivision Me/EmaqAae (Me/Emaqaua 
in the Naqo'mg-ilisala dialect) of the Xaqo'mg-ilisala. These are the 
descendants of Le'laxa (=coming often from above) the son of Q'c'q'a- 
qaaalis, whose legend will be found below (p. 41(5). Their original 
Lome is the island G-ig-e'LEm, one of the small islands southeast of 
Hope Island. LEla'k-En was a later chief of the clan. His daughter 
was Lad'noqumeqa. They moved to the island Q/oa'sqEmlis and built 
a village. The chief made a statue like the one represented liere. It 
is hollow behind and its mouth is open. In the potlatch the chief stands 
behind the mouth of the statue and sjieaks through it, thus indicating 
that it is his ancestor who is speaking. LEla/k-En had one dish repre- 
senting a wolf, another one representing a man, and a third one in tko

shape of a bear. As the mau who made the 
present statue was too poor to have all these 
carvings made, he had them carved on the statue 
instead. 

Figure 21 represents a totem i)ole, which was 
standing until a few years ago in front of a house 
in Xumta'spe (ISTewettee). The crest belongs to 
the subdivision"^-'ek-'r)'te of the clan G-i'g-ilqam. 
According to the legend, these people are the 
descendants of'6--'ote, the son of K-cpusaladqoa, 
the youngest daughter of Kue/xag-ila, the son of 
Hataqa, the daughter of 0"meaL. (Seep. 374.) 
Thej^ have the Ts'o'noqoa, a man split in two, 
another man, wolf, beaver, and the sea monster 
ts'c/qic for dishes. A man named NE'mqEmalis 
married a daughter of the-^-'eg-'o'te chief, and he 

had all these dishes made. Lateron, a man named 
Qoayo'LElas married NE'mqEmalis's cousin. 

Then he was told to unite 

the dishes and to carve a 

totem i^ole. He did so. 

The second figure from 
below is placed upside 

down because the dish 

was in the back of the 

man, while all the others 

were in the bellies of the 

carvings. This history 

may also explain the fact 

that all the figures are 

separated on this column, 

while in most other totem 

poles they overlap, one 

holding the other or one 

standing on the other.

upon them and they grew large. He called the first Qoa/qoak-imlilas

sold for the post (O'ma'yu), its price. The figure underneath is a 

bear (nan), which belongs to the clan 
La'lauiLEla of the same tribe. Figure

the same house. On top the figure of 
of BebekumlisI'la is seen. The bear 
underneath was obtained from the

the price paid for the post.

A very characteristic tradition is that 
of the clan NfmEraas- 
Eqalis of the Lau'itsis : 
In the beginning

at A'g-iwa'laa, in front of Tsa'xis. He had a house 
there. His son was L'a'qoag-IlaqEmae. ISTomasE'n- 
xelis came up with his copper. It is said that in the 
beginning he lay on it with his knees drawn up, and 
therefore his child was called L'a/qoag'ilaqEmae. Then 
Yix-a/qEmae, NomasE'nxelis's uncle, asked him to get 
a wife for him. Yix*a'qEmae lived at LiXsi'wae. He 
induced NomasE'nxelis to come there and live with 
him. His son was to marry the daughter of Sa/g*iye. 
Yix'a/qEmae desired to have Sa'g'iye's house and 
carvings, therefore he wanted to .marry his daughtei-. 
A killer whale was the painting of the house front. 
Gulls were sitting on its roof. Various kinds of carv- 
ings were in the house. Then aSTdmasE'nxelis went 
out of the canoe to speak. He took his staff' (fig. 24); 
therefore his staff has a hand on top of it, because he 
carried there on his hands the chief's daughters of 
all the tribes. Then he got the daughter of Sa'g-iye. 
Only NumasE'nxelis and Yix-a'qEmae lived in that 
house. Now, when it was time to go to Ts'a'wate,i 
they made themselves ready. NOmasE'nxelis wanted 
to give a feast from the sale of his copper. They paddled and stopped 
at L'a/qoaxstElis. There he wanted to take a stone and put it into his 
house. They tried to take the stone into the canoe when they were

goiug to TsTi'wate. They were not strong enough to take it. Then lie 
put his copper under the stone. Therefore tlie stone 
received the name "copper under it." Then he said 
/'il»l he had received the stone as price for his copper. 

Xow they arrived at Ts'a' wate. Then he used his staff 
with a copper on top. A hand was on top also. Then 
he gave a feast to many tribes, and changed his name 
and took the name Kuax-ilano'kumc. L'a'qoag-ila- 
qEmae was now the nameof his successor; Ts'ama was 
the name of another child of his. That is the end. 
(Appendix, p. 073.) 

There is one legend which is of importance in this 
connection, because the rank of the various names and 
the laws governing potlatch and feast are derived 
from it. I give here a version of the tale, which, 
however, is not quite complete and requires some ad- 
ditional remarks. It is the legend of O'maxt'a'laLe, 
the clan legend of the G-I'g-ilqam of the Q'o'moyue: 

A bird was sitting on the beach at TE'ng-is. He 
took off his mask, and then his name was NEmO'gwis. 
He became a man. Then he moved to K-'a'qa. He 
had a son whom he named O'maxt'a'laLe. The child 
grew up fast; he became a real man. He was very 
strong. He walked with his uncle LO'La'watsa on the 
beach of Tsa'xis and clubbed seals. They were walk- 
ing back and fro clubbing seals. Then NEmo'gwis 
spoke to his younger brother Lo'La'watsa: "Friend, 
don't let us go on in this manner. Let us try to ar- 
range that our son may go out to sea." He desired 
to have more game than the sea otters and seals 
which they were able to club on the beach of Tsa'xis. 
Therefore they wanted to go to the islands. Then 
NEmo'gwis and his younger brother burnt the inside 
of a cedar and burnt its ends, thus making a canoe. 
They linished it. Then they launched the canoe that 
they had made for the child. They tried the canoe 
tliat the child was to use Avhen going to Deer Island. 
O'maxt'a'laLe was annoyed, and when he came back, 
his canoe was full of sea otters and seals. He kept 
on going out every day and caught many sea otters 
and seals. Then he said: "Let us try to discover 
how many tribes there are. Let someone go and call 
them." Then ISTEmo'gwis's younger brother Lo'La'- 
watsa paddled. He \\as going to La'la'te to call

Then he paddled to O's'eq and called He'ilik-inakula; then to Xa'lax-

Meanwhile the child of Xemo'gwis was clubbing- and harpooning 
seals for his father's feast. His house was already full of sea otter 
furs, which were used for blankets by the people of old. They were 
sewed together. Now the tribes gathered. He met his guests and 
distributed seals among them. He gave them their seats and gave his 
gifts to the chiefs. Xemo'gwis kept for them the belly part. He gave 
the hind legs to the chiefs of another tribe. He gave the flippers to 
the second-class chiefs, and the bodies to the common peo])le. He gave 
each clan its place. He gave the bellies to the highest chief. He bit 
off these parts and had messengers to pass them on to his guests. It 
is said he bit off whatever he gave to his guests. Then he was 
called Walas Xemo'gwis and he called his successor O'maxt'a'laLe. 
Then he gave out the blankets to all the clans, giving the law for later 
generations. Some of the guests stayed with him and became his 
tribe. 

Xow O'maxt'a'laLc said to his father: "I shall go a little farther this 
time. Do not expect me; but first I will go bathing." Then 
O'maxt'a'laLe went in the morning. After he had bathed he heard the 
sound of adzes. He made up his mind to look where the sound came 
from, because the sound was near when he first heard it. But it moved 
away as he followed it and O'maxt'a'laLe came to a pond. He bathed 
again and the sound came still nearer. Ue followed the sound, which 
was going before him. He came to another pond and bathed again. 
Then the sound of adzes came still nearer. He followed it as it went 
before him. Now he found still another pond. He bathed, and the 
sound came still nearer. He went toward it and now he saw a canoe. 
A man was sitting in the canoe working on it with his adze. In the 
bow of the canoe lay a harpoon shaft and two paddles. O'maxt'a'laLe 
stood behind the man. He was the grouse. Then O'maxt'a'laLe spoke : 
"Thank you, that I have found what you are working on." The 
grouse looked at him and disappeared. Thus O'maxt'a'laLe found the 
canoe, the harpoon shaft, and the paddle. 

Then he put his nettle line into his canoe. He and his uncle 
L'o'L'awatsa went out. He went across the Sound trying to reach 
Noomas Island. Then he saw a canoe coming from YaaiXugiwano. 
They met at Noomas Island, and held the sides of each other's canoe.

"Good day, brother," said O'lnaxt'a/laLe to Qa'watiliqala, "I do not 
come without purpose. My father sent me, because you are the only 
one whose daughter I will marry." Qa'watiliqala replied: "Paddle 
behind me and follow me to my house." O'maxt'a'laLe said: "I will 
give you my harpoon line, friend, my nettle line, my harpoon shaft, and 
my mat." Qa'watiliqala then gave his leather line to his brother and 
they exchanged their canoes and everything in the canoes that they 
used. Then O'maxt'a'laLe said: "Let us go back. That smoke 
belongs to our house." "No," replied Qa'watiliqala, "Let us go on to 
my house. You said you wanted to be engaged to my daughter." 
Then the two paddled side by side together. They reached the lower 
part of the river at Gua'e. "Take care, brother, when we enter my 
house. When we enter my house, follow close on my heels," said 
Qa'watiliqala. He told his brother that the door of his house was dan- 
gerous. They walked up to the door together. The door had the 
shape of a raven. It opened and they jumped iu and the raven 
snapped at him. All the images in Q;l/watiliqala's house were alive, 
the posts were alive, and the si'siuL beams. Then O'maxt'a'laLe mar- 
ried Wilx-stasilayuqoa, the daughter of Qri'watiliqala. The house and 
the images and all kinds of food were given him in marriage, and blan- 
kets of lynx, marmot, wolverine, mink, and dressed elk skins. Then 
his father-in law and his tribe brought him home. They brought 
everything, also the house. He built a house at K-'a'qa. That is why 
the place is called K'Ti'qa, because logs were placed all around for the 
foundation of the house which he had obtained in marriage. Then 
Omaxt'a'laLe invited all the tribes with w^hat he had obtained in mar- 
riage from his wife. (See Appendix p. G75.) 

In the feast referred to in the preceding legend NEmo'gwis is said to 
have given each of his guests his seat, which their descendants have 
retained. He also arranged how the parts of the seal with w^hich he 
fed his guests were to be distributed. The chest was given to the head 
chief, the next in rank received the hind flippers, and the young men 
of the nobility the fore flippers. He also instituted at the feast the 
laws according to which blankets are given away and returned later on. 

This legend is so important that I will give another version which I 
obtained at Fort Rupert : 

NEmo'gwis lived in a village at Wekawayaas. He was the ancestor 
of the G-i'g-ilqam of the Q'd'mdyuf^. He wore the sun mask on his 
face. He had a slave named lo'qatsa and had a boy. This son was 
growing up quickly and he came to be a man. Now NEmo'gwis took 
a walk and saw a village at Ta'yaguL. There he saw a man who wore 
a bird mask sitting on the ground. The mask had a small hooked nose. 
Then NEmo'gwis spoke to him: "O brother! thank you for meeting 
me here. Who are you?" The other one replied, " I am Ts'E'nXqaio, 
brother.'^ Then NEmo'gwis asked Ts'E'nXqaio: "Who is living in the 
house beyond?" Ts'E'nXqaio replied: "I do not know him." Xeuio'- 
gwjs w^^lked pjj to the east end of Ta'yaguL, where the other house was

staudiug. He discovered au old man sittiug outside the Louse. He 
wore a bird mask. JSTEmo'gwis spoke : " O, brother ! thank you for meet- 
iiig- me here. Who are you?" The old man replied: "I am La'laX- 
sEut'aio." Then NEmo'gwis asked him : '^ Who is living in the house at 
the river?" LcVlaXsEnt'aio replied: "I do not know him." Then 
NEmo'gwis walked on and arrived at Tsa'xis. There he beheld a man 
sitting on the summer seat outside the house, and jSTEmo'gwis spoke to 
him and said: "O, brother! thank you for meeting me here. Who 
are youf The man replied at once: "I am Kuax-ilano'kume and my 
tribe are the G-i'g*ilqam." And he asked NEuiO'gwis : " W^ho are you, 
brother? Where is your village?" ISTEmd'gwis replied: "I am ISTEmo'- 
gwis. My younger brother is Bo'nakwala. We and my son, we three, 
live in my village, Wekawayaas." Then spoke Kuax'ilano'kume: 
"Thank you, brother, for meeting me here." And XEmo'gwis went 
home to Wekawayaas. When he arrived there, he told his younger 
brother and his son what he had seen. 

He spoke to his son : " O, child, see the sea otters, the seals, and the 
sea lions on Shell Island." Then his son wanted to go there. Bo'na- 
kwala and lo'qatsa rolled a drift log into the water. The son of NEmo'- 
^wis was to use it in place of a canoe. They brought it to the beach in 
front of NEmo'gwis's bouse and showed it to the young man. He sat 
on top of it and went to the island in order to club sea otters and seals. 
When he arrived at the island he began clubbing the sea otters and 
seals. He finished, and put them on his drift log. Then he went home. 
Bo'nakwala and T:o'T;atsa met him on the beach and they unloaded the 
log. NEmo'gwis spoke: "(), child, now your name is O'maxt'a'laLe on 
account of j^our game." He invited Ts'E'nXqaio and Lii'laXsEut'aio 
and Kuax-ilano'kume and Ma'tag-ila. The four men came to the house 
and sat down. Then Bo'nakwala put stones into the fire and singed the 
seal. When he had done so, he cut it up. He filled the kettle with 
water and then threw the red-hot stones into the water until it began to 
boil. Then he put the pieces of seal meat into the boiling water and 
added more red-hot stones. After a short while the seal was done. 
Bo'nakwala took the meat out of the water, and XEnio'gwis took the 
breast piece first. He bit it and gave it to Ts'E'nXqaio, saying: "You 
shall always be the first one to receive his share, and you shall always 
have the breast piece." Xext he took the hind leg and gave it to 
Kuax-ilano'kuine, saying: " You shall always have this piece, and it 
shall be given to you next to Ts'E'nXqaio." Then he took up the 
foreleg of the seal, bit it, and gave it to Ma'tag-ila, saying: "You shall 
always have this piece." Then he gave a whole seal to Ts'EuXqaio, 
Kuax-iland'kume, and Ma'tag-ila, and told them thename of his sou. He 
said: "I invited you to show you my son. This is O'maxt'a'laLe." 
Bo'nakwala now addressed the guests. Therefore the people nowa- 
days make speeches in their feasts, because NEmd'gwis l)egnn making 
speeches and distributing blankets and canoes among all the tribes.

After the feast they all left the house. Bo'nakwala looked for a good 
log of cedar wood. He found one and brought it to the beach in front 
of JSTEinO'guis's house. When the tide had fallen, he burnt its ends and 
the middle, thus hollowing it out. It was to be the canoe of O'maxt'a/- 
laLe. As soon as it was completed, he gave it to O'maxt'a'laLe. The 
latter went at once to Shell Island and clubbed sea otters. He did not 
club any hair seals. When he came home, Bo'nakwala and ^o'^atsa 
skinned the sea otters. Then Bo'nakwala spoke : "O, child! O'maxt'- 
fi'laLe! I will go now. Do not feel aneasy if I should stay away long." 
O'maxt'a'laLe replied : "Go on, but take good care of yourself." His 
uncle Bo'nakwala went and came to Ga'yux. At night he bathed in 
water and rubbed his body with hemlock branches. On the following 
morning ho went on and heard the sound of an adze close to where he 
was. He went up to the sound. Then it stopped, and reappeared a 
long ways oft". Then Bo'nakwala went again, and bathed in the water 
and rubbed his body with hemlock branches. He went on and again 
he heard the sound of an adze near by. He went to see what it was, 
and again the sound stopped and reappeared a long ways off. He 
went at once to the water and bathed again and rubbed his body with 
hemlock branches. He went on and heard again the sound of an adze 
near by. When he went up to the sound it stopped, and reappeared a 
long ways off. Again he bathed and rubbed his body ^ith hemlock 
branches. When he had finished, he went on and suddenly he beheld 
a pretty hunting canoe lying on the ground. He went up to it and 
pushed it into the water, into the river of Ga'yux. He went in it down 
the river. In the canoe were two paddles and a harpoon. He rested 
at the mouth of the river and then paddled home to Wekawayaas. 
When he arrived at the beach of NEmo'gwis's house, O'maxt'a'laLe came 
down to meet him. Then Bo'nakwala spoke: "O, child, I obtained a 
canoe for you." O'maxt'a'laLe made ready at once to go to Shell 
Island and asked the slave T:o'T:atsa to steer the canoe. They started, 
and when they arrived at Sliell Island, O'maxt'a'laLe clubbed the sea 
otters. Then he loaded his canoe, which was full of sea otters. When 
they were going home, the slave said: "O, master, let me see how you 
spear a sea otter with your harpoon." Then O'maxt'a'laLe said : '-Steer 
toward that sea otter and I will spear it." The slave turned the bow 
of the canoe toward the sea otter and O'niaxt'a'laLe threw and hit it. 
Then they returned home. When they arrived at the beach, Bo'na- 
kwala came to meet them. They unloaded the canoe, and Bo'nakwala 
and T:o'T:atsa skinned the sea otters and stretched the skins. After 
that they ate. Then O'maxtVi'laLe spoke: "O, father! I will go and 
see who lives east of us." NEmo'gwis replied: "Child, beware of 
storms when yon cross the sea. Go, and take qo'iatsa along." Early 
the next day O'maxt'a'laLe and T:o'^[atsa started. They spread the 
sea-otter skins over the bottom of their canoe and j^addled straight 
across to the north end of the island at the mouth of Knight Inlet. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 387 

When he approached YaaiXugiwano, he saw a canoe with two jneu 
coming np. O'maxt'a'laLe paddled toward this canoe. When the 
canoes were side by side, the men took hold of each other's gunwale 
and O'maxt'a/laLc said: "Where are you going, brother?" The one 
in the bow of the other canoe replied: "Brother, I au" hunting among 
these islands here. I thank you for meeting me here. I am Qa'wati- 
liqala. Who are you, brother?" O'maxt'a'laLe replied: "Thank you, 
brother, for meeting me here. I am O'maxt'a'laLe. Let us go to my 
house, the smoke of which we see there on the other side. It is not far. 
Come, take my canoe; it is yours now." Then Qa'watiliqala spoke: 
"Brother, now this my canoe is yours and everything that is in it." 
He meant the mountain goat skins with which it was covered and his 
harpoon. But O'maxt'a'laLe's canoe was all covered with sea-otter 
skius. His blanket was made of sea otter and his harpoon line of the 
guts of the sea lion, while Qa'watiliqala's line was of cedar bark and 
his blanket made of mountain goat skin. O'maxt'a'laLe spoke : "Thank 
you, brother. Now come across to your canoe and let me go into the 
canoe you gave me." Qa'watiliqala arose and went into O'maxt'a'- 
laLe's canoe, and O'maxt'a'laLe arose and went into Qa'watiliqala's 
canoe. This was as though they had exchanged their hearts so that 
they liad only one heart now. 

Then Qa'watiliqala spoke: "That is done. ISTow, brother, come to 
my house. It is beyond this point." They paddled on, and when they 
had nearly reached Qa'watiliqala's house, he said : " Brother, take care. 
When I jump into my house, you and your slave must jump in at the 
same time.'' Now they arrived at the beach in front of the house of 
Qa'watiliqala. They went ashore and walked up to the house. When 
they arrived in front of the house, the mouth of the door of Qa'watili- 
qala's house opened. They jumped in all at the same time and it bit 
only a corner of Lo'Latsa's blanket. Then the posts at the sides of the 
door spoke, and the one to the right hand side said: "You made them 
come to your house, Qa'watiliqala;" and the post on the left-hand side 
said : " Now spread a mat and give your guests to eat, Chief." It is said 
that the cross-beams over the rear posts were double-headed snakes 
(sI'siuL), which were constantly playing with their tongues. The posts 
in the rear of the house were wolves, and a grizzly bear was under each 
of the wolves. Carved images were all round the house. O'maxt'a'laL 
and Lo'Latsa were sitting in the house and were given mountain goat 
meat to eat. When they had finished eating, the speaker of the house 
said: "What do you want here?" Xow O'maxt'a'laLe beheld the 
daughter of Qa'watiliqala, who was sitting in the rear of the house. 
He thought: " I will say that I came to marry her." Then the thought 
hearer of the house spoke : "Chief ( )'maxt'a'laLe came to marry Qa'wa- 
tiliqala's princess." Qa'watiliqala said at once : " O, brother ! thank you 
that you want to marry my daughter. It has been my desire that 
you should marry her, brother ( )'inaxt'a'laLe. Now you marry my prin- 
cess and you shall have this house for your house as a gift from your

wife and the great wolf dance Walas'axa'.^ Its names are G-alg*ayalis 
and G*alqEmalis and QEmo'ta'yalis and QEinotilelag-ilis, and your sum- 
mer names will be NEg-e' and Neg'e'ts'C' and Qoaxo'L and G-'ig'ESLEu. 
The great dance Walas'axa' has forty songs. You will use this house for 
the celebration of the wiuter ceremonial, my son-in-law. That is all." 
Thus spoke Qa'watiliqala to O'maxt'a'laLe. The latter replied : "Thank 
you, Chief Qa'watiliqala. I am glad on account of your speech, father- 
in-law. Now teach me the songs of the dance Walas'axa', for I will at 
once invite all the tribes when I reach home." Thus spoke O'maxt'a'- 
laLc. 

The speaker of the house said: "O, Chief Qa'watiliqala! Let us 
have the winter ceremonial to-night, that our sonin law may see our 
ways." Qa'watiliqala answered : " My speaker, your advice is good," 
and, turning to the wolf posts of the house, he continued: "Now take 
care, friends, you, QEmo'ta'yalis, and you, QEmotilElag-ilis. Howl, that 
our friends G'alalaLila and his children may come." When he had 
finished, O'maxt'a'laLc said: "O, father-in-law ! I now invite you and 
your tribe to bring my house, myself, and my wife to my place. 1 can 
not withstand your words, father-in-law! I say, thank you! Now let 
rae watch your supernatural dances to-night, else I shall not know 
what 3^ou are doing in this great dance." 

At night the speaker of the house said: "Now, magicians, howl ! 
that G-alalaLila and liis chihlren may come." Then QEmo'ta'yalis and 
QEmotilElag-ilis, the posts of the house, howled four times each. At 
once a howl like theirs was heard back of the house. Then Qa'watili- 
qala called his tribe, the ancestors of the Ts'a'watEenox. They entered 
their chief's house, and as soon as they had assembled the wolves came 
in. All the men cried: "Yihli, hu, hfi, hu, hu, hu!" Four times they 

did so, and then they sang: 

I. 

1. He was made to sit between the wolves, hai. 

2. He was taken around the world by LriHstalaqa, the wolf, hfii.

For four years I was coming home. Then Ma't'Km took me away.

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 389 

These are all the songs I know. If you will go to the Ts'a/watEenox 
you can learn all the forty songs of the Walas'axa'. 

When the dance of the wolves was at an end, Qa'watiliqala said : 
'■'• O, friends, I invited you, my tribe, that you may know that I give my 
daughter in marriage to O'maxt'a'laLe, chief of the G-i'g-ilqam on the 
other side. Now let us go and take our son-in-law, his wife, and his 
house liome. And he shall take this great dance. Let us go to- 
morrow !" Then the people left the house and the next day they made 
ready to start. They went across, taking the house and Qa'watiliqala's 
daughter. They stopped at Ga/yuX. They built a foundation of drift 
logs. In four days they finished the house. 

Then O'niaxtTi'laLe Avent to tell his father NEmo'gwis. He entered 
the house and said: "Come, father! let us go to my house at Ga'yux. 
I have married the daughter of Qa'watiliqala. I brought my father- 
in-law and his tribe, and also the house and the great dance Wrdas'- 
axa', and a great box and three baskets. I do not know what is in 
them." NEmo'gwis replied : "Let us invite Ts'E'nXqaio and La'laX- 
sEnt'aio and Kuax-iland'knmae, that they may see your house." And 
he sent Bd'nakwala to invite the tribes. Then O'maxt'a'laLd and his 
father went, and O'maxt'a'laLe said: "Take care, father! As soon as I 
jump through the door of my house you jump with me." When they 
arrived at the house, the mouth of the door opened and the father and 
son jumped iu. Then the posts said: "Goon! greet them who come 
into your house. Chief!" XEmd'gwis spoke : " W^elcome, Brother Qa'wa- 
tiliqala. I have heard about you. I thank you for having given your 
daughter and your house to my sou." Qa'watiliqala replied: "O, 
brother, I am glad that I have seen you. From now on your name 
will be Great NEmo'gwis (Wa'las NEmo'gwis). This box filled with 
curried skin blankets is for you, and the basket filled with marten 
skins, the one filled with mink skins, and this one filled with lynx 
blankets." Then O'maxt'a'laLe left his house, because he heard men 
speaking outside. He saw his uncle Bo'nakwala and the guests whom 
he had invited. Then O'maxt'a'laLe said: "Now let us jump into my 
house all at the same time." When they were all ready, the door 
opened and they all jumped in. Then the posts spoke: "Go on ! greet 
them who come into your house. Chief!" The guests sat down, and 
were given to eat. When they had finished, they performed the winter 
ceremonial. O'maxt'a'laLe showed the Walas'axa'. Afterwards he 
gave sea otters to Qa'watiliqala's tribe, and he gave blankets made of 
curried leather, marten blankets, mink blankets, and lynx blankets to 
Ts'E'uXqaio, La'laxsEnt'aiO, and Kuax-iland'kumae. His winter dance 
lasted four days. He was the first who gave away blankets to all the 
tribes, and who gave a seal feast. That is the end. 

Before leaving this subject I must mention that all the clans authen- 
ticate the claim to their rank and to the greatness of their ancestor by 
telling of a meeting between him and one of the two deities which 
l)revail iu the mythology of these tribes, Q'a'nig-ilak" in the Newettee 



390 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



groni), and Kneknaxa/oe among the other tribes. The La'lauiXEla of 
the La'Lasiqoala, for instance, say that their ancestor, NomasE'nxelis, 
knew that Q'a/nig-ilak" was coming. Then he told his son LExx-a'lix-i- 
la'yu to go to Xu'spalis (Newettee Bar) and there to await Q'a/nig-ilak"'s 
arrival. He himself remained, and was transformed by Q'a'nig-ilak" 
into a stone, which may still be seen on Hope Island. LExx-a'lix-ila'yu 
went to Xu'spalis, but Q'a'nig-ilak" did not molest him, because he was 
afraid of him. 

The Cx-I'gMlqam of the same tribe say that he met 0"meaL, who 
pointed liis foretingerat him when he sawhim coming. At once his head 

was perforated. Q'a/nig*ilak" retaliated, and 
they saw tliat they were equally strong. 

I do not need to enter into these legends 
any fartlier, because they are all of the same 
character and are merely intended to show 
that the ancestors of these clans were i)res- 
ent at the time of the transformation of men 
into animals, and that they were as strong 
as the deity himself. For the details of the 
Q'a/nig-ilak" legend I refer to my book.' 

With this I will leave the clan legends and 
their connection with the crest and the pot- 
latch. Incidentally I will mention here that 
figures commemorating distributions of 
property, the breaking of coppers, and 
grease feasts are often placed on top of the 
house or on the poles. To this class belongs 
the statue of the speaker under the sun 
mask (fig. l,p.338), and the speaker on top of 
a house in Alert Bay ( fig. 25). Other statues 
of the same class are shown in Plate 18, 
representing a chief who gives away coppers in a feast, and Plate 19, 
representing a chief breaking a copper. This last figure is placed on 
top of the house at the time when the father-in-law refunds the purchase 
money with whi(*h his daughter has been bought. 

In order to convey a better idea of the arrangement of the whole vil- 
lage, I give here a sketch of the village of Newettee as it appeared in 
188G from a sketch taken by myself at that time (fig. 26). The names 
printed in Roman letters designate the names of the houses, those in 
Italics names of mountains on Galiano Island, and the one in Italic capi- 
tals is the name of the bay. The house Wa/tsuxfiioa will be recognized 
as fig. 17 (p. 377). The post in front of it is shown in fig. 21 (p. 380). 
1 have referred several times to the fact that the clans also have 
peculiar carvings which are used as dishes. A few of these are repre- 
sented on Plates 20 and 21 and in figs. 27-34. The dish shown in the 
Tipper figure of Plate 20 represents the Ts'd'noqoa (see figs. 13 and 14,

p. 372). That shown in the next figure on the left of the same plate 
represents a man and a snake. 

From the fact that so many carvings have reference to the clan totem 
we must not conclude that each and every animal or human figure found 

on any implement has the same 
meaning. It seems to me that the 
strong impulse which the art of 
these people received from the devel- 
opment of totemistic ideas must 
have resulted in the general appli- 
cation of animal designs for decora- 
tive purposes. That this is the case 
may be seen particularly in the case 
of dishes. The most favorite designs 
for dishes all over the cultural area 
to which the Kwakiutl belong are 
the seal and the canoe. The seal is not a totem animal, but merely the 
symbol of plenty, as no animal of its size furnishes a larger amount of 
meat and fat. Therefore the seal feast is also reserved for the highest 
tribes of the Kwakiutl. The seal 
design is used by each and every 
tribe and by each and every clan. 
The same is often the case with 
the sea-lion design. I have 
selected a number of the most 
characteristic seal dishes (figs. 28, 
29, 30), and also a sea-lion dish 

(fig. 31). The dish represented y\<j,.28

ning at Yakutat. The deep, round forms become flatter and wider 
and the carving is less elaborate. The idea underlying the canoe dish 
is evidently that a great abundance of food, a canoe load, is to be given 

to the guests (figs. 32, 33, 34). The 
canoe dish develops into a number 
of animal forms, mainly through the 
influence of canoe decorations. 
The canoe is often painted so as to 
represent a whole animal. This 
ornamentation was transferred to 
the dish and has inflnenced its form 
(ionsiderably, as may be seen in fig. 
34. I merely adduce these examples 
in order, to show that not all ani- 
mal forms have necessarily a totemistic origin. I think, however, that 
in the course of the develoi)ment of this culture the preponderance of 
animal designs which were originally founded on totemism must have by

a process of euhemerism contributed to the prolific gTowtli of the totem. 
We Lave seen that the tendency to decorate objects with animal designs 
was fostered by an art whi(;h was applied almost exclusively to represen. 
tationsof thetotem. Thus the animal became the dominatiug decorative 
element. Theforceof analogy mnst 
then have induced the people to in- 
terpret certain animal figures which 
were originally only decotative on 
the principle of totemism. 

Other objects, such as drums (fig. 
35, p. 305), boxes, house posts, etc., 

seem to be exclusively decorated rig.so. 

with designs representing the 
totem.

VI. The Spirits Presiding over the Keligioits Ceremonial 

AND THEIR GlPTS. 

It is a common feature of all the legends referred to heretofore that 
the supernatural powers which were obtained by the ancestors became 
the crest of a clan, and that there is no mention of an immediate rela- 
tion between the descendants of the ancestor and his crest. We have 
1o deal only with legends commemorating the early history of the clan. 
They do not indicate that the being which helped the ancestor con- 
tinues to protect his descendants. 

We have now to deal with another class of legends which relate 
entirely to spirits that are still in constant contact with the Indians, 
whom they endow with supernatural powers. In order to gain their 
help, the youth must prepare himself by fasting and washing, because 
only the pure find favor with them, while they kill the impure. 
Every young man endeavors to find a protector of this kind. It is 

clear that this idea corresponds 
exactly to the manitou of the 
Algonquin Indians, and that we 
have to deal here with the ele- 
mentary idea of the acquisition 
of a guardian spirit, which has 
attained its strongest develop- 
ment in America. Its specific 
character on the North Pacific 
Coast lies in the fact that the 
guardian spirit has become he- 
reditary. This is the case 
among the northern tribes of British Columbia. It is also the case 
among the Kwakiutl and among the Chinook. When the youth pre- 
pares to meet a guardian spirit, he does not expect to find any but those 
of his clan. This is i)r()bably the reason for the relatively small number

of sncli spirits— for iinioiigtbe Indians of tlie plains, ana on gwliom each 
man has his individual si)irit, their number is unlimited — and it has 
also given occasion for the development of a more elaborate mythology 

relating to these spirits. 
^^ yj\^^ I shall give a list and brief descrip- 

pi^^^^^^==;;;:^===-----^-':#^-'^ ^^ tions of these spirits and of their gifts. 

I. Wina'lag'ilis (=making war all 
over tlie earth). The descriptions of 
this being are very indefinite. He is 
a warrior and lives in the far north. 
He travels about constantly and never 
leaves his canoe. So far as I am aware 
he is never represented in masks or 
other carvings. By obtaining his pro- 
tection a youth may acquire one of the following powers. He may 
become a — 

(1) T'o'X'uit, who is invulnerable and has power over the sI'siuL, 
which assists him and his friends on war expeditions. 

(2) Ma/maq'a. The mfi/maq'a 
has the power to catch the in- 
visible disease spirit, which is 
constantly flying through the air 
in the form of a worm. He is able 
to throw it into his enemies, who 
die from its effects at once. 

(3) Hawi'nalaL (= war dancer), 
who by the help of Wina'lag-ilis is 
insensible to the pain of wounds 
and can not be killed, may he be 
ever so severely wounded. 

II. BaxbakualanuXsT'wae (the first one to eat man at the mouth of the 
river, i. e., in the north, because the ocean is considered a stream running 
northward). He is a cannibal living on the mountains who is always in 

pursuitof man. Bed smoke rises 
from his house. His servant (or 
wife) is Q'o'mindqas (=the rich 
woman), who procures food for 
him. He has a female slave, 
K-i'nqalauala, who also procures 
food for him, by catching men 
and gathering corpses. Near 
the door, in his house, sits his 
slave Qoa/xqoaxualanuXsiwae, 
the raven, who eats the eyes of 
the peo))le whom his master has devoured. In his house live also the 
ho'Xhuk", a fabulous bird, with an immensely long beak, which lives 
on the brains of men, whose skulls he fractures with his beak, and the

A person who meets liim or one of Lis suit may become a

human flesh, and who devours whomsoever he can lay his hands upon.

(4) Na'ne s BaxbakualanuXsI'wae, the grizzly bear of the cannibal 
spirit, who delights in killing people with his strong paws. 

(5) K'i'nqahiLala, who procures human flesh for the ha'mats'a. 

(6) Q'o'mindqa, who also procures human flesh for the ha'mats'a.

describe in wliat tlie gift of the spirit consists. This difficulty appears 
even in the preceding- list of the most important spirits. 

O^Ying to tlie fact that these spiints are hereditary, their gifts are 
always contained in the legend detailing their acquisition by the ances- 
tor of a clan. The principal gifts in these tales are the magic har- 
poon which insures success in sea-otter hunting; the death hringer 
which, when pointed against enemies, kills them ; the water of life which 
resuscitates the dead; the burning fire which, when pointed against an 
object, burns it; and a dance, a song, and cries which are peculiar to 
the spirit. The gift of this dance means that the protege of the 
spirit is to perform the same dances which have been shown to him. 
In these dances he personates the spirit. He wears his mask and his 
ornaments. Thus the dance must be considered a dramatic perform- 
ance of the myth relating to the acquisition of the spirit, and shows to 
the people that the performer by his visit to the spirit has obtained 
his powers and desires. When nowadays a spirit appears to a young 
Indian, he gives him the same dance, and the youth also returns from 
the initiation filled with the powers and desires of the spirit. He 
authenticates his initiation by his dance in the same way as his mythi- 
cal ancestor did. 

The obtaining of the magical gifts from these spirits is called 
Lo'koala, while the person who has obtained them becomes nau'aJak", 
supernatural, which is also the quality of the spirit himself. 

The ornaments of all these spirits are described as made of cedar 
bark, which is dyed red in the juice of alder bark. They appear to their 
devotees only in winter, and therefore the dances are also performed 
only in winter. For this reason they may conveniently be called the 
winter ceremonial. I shall revert to this subject more fully later on. 

The following legend of the origin of the ha'mats'a (told by the 
Na'q'oaqtoq) will make clearer what I have said: 

The first of the Awl'k-'enox lived at Wa'waLala. Their chief was 
Na'nwaqawe. He had four sons who were mountain-goat hunters. 
At one time the members of his tribe were disappearing one after 
the other and he did not know what became of them. Na'nwaqawe 
wanted to eat mountain-goat meat. His sous offered to go out hunt- 
ing. These are the names of the sons of Nri/nwaqawe: Ta'wix-aniaye 
and Qofi'qoasililag-ilis, and Ya/fjois, and the name of the youngest 
was Nii'Lilokuc. The young men made themselves ready, and then 
Na'nwaqawe advised them. He said: "Do not enter the house the 
smoke of which looks like blood, else you will never return home. 
It is the house of BaxbakualanuXsi'wae. The smoke of the house 
of the goat is white; go there when you see it. Do not go to the 
house the smoke of which is grey on one side; it is the house of 
the grizzly bear. Else harm will befall you. Kow go, my sous, and 
mind what I told you." Ta'wix-amaye replied: "We will try to avoid 
misfortnne.'' The young men left early in the morning. About noon 
they discovered tlie grey smoke of which their father had spoken. 
Ta'wix-amaye spoke: "Now let us see if our father's advice is good. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 397 

Only take care, dear brothers, that no harm may befall us." They 
went on and soon they met the grizzly bear. They fought with him 
and he almost killed them, but finally they overcame the bear and 
killed him. The brothers went ou. At night they slept. In the morn^ 
ing Yfi'qois awakened his brothers. They went on for a long time; 
then Ta'wix-amaye said: "My dear brothers, do you see that smoke 
over there? That is what our father meant when he spoke of the 
bloody smoke of the house of BaxbakualanuXsi'wae. Let us go 
there!" They walked on and came to the door of the house. It was 
open aud the brothers entered. As soon as they came in, a woman 
called them. Ta'wix*amaye stepped up to her and the woman said : 
"I am rooted to the floor. I will help you. This house into which you 
came belongs to BaxbakualanuXsi'wae. Kow do as I tell you and 
take notice of what you will see. Dig a deep hole in that corner of 
this house. Then put stones into the fire, and when they are red-hot 
put them into the hole." When the brothers had done so, she con- 
tinued: "Now cover the hole with boards. As soon as Baxbakua- 
lanuXsi'wae comes home he will dance, wearing his mask on his 
forehead." As soon as the brothers had finished their work a whis- 
tling sound was heard. Then the woman said : "!N"ow sit down. I will 
say that 1 found food, that he may not see what we have planned." 
BaxbakualanuXsi'wae entered crying "hap." Then the ho'Xhok" 
and QoaxqoaxualanuXsi'wae began to shout. BaxbakualanuXsi'wae 
lay ou his back. His body was covered all over with mouths. Then 
he arose. He became excited and went four times around the house 
crying "hap." Then he went into his bedroom (ma'wiL). As soon 
as BaxbakualanuXsI wae had gone in there, the raven with feathers 
on his head which reached down to his waist came out and danced, 
going around the fire. The raven went back into the bedroom. Then 
QoaxqoaxurilanuXsI'wae came out crying "hap, hai), go'u, go'u!" and 
danced around the fire. Then he went back into the bedroom and out 
came BaxbakualanuXsi'wae crying, "hap." He danced around the 
fire and went back into his bedroom. Then came the ho'Xhok" crying 
" Hap, hap, ho, ho." He danced around the fire and went back into his 
bedroom. IsTow BaxbakualanuXsrwae and his four k-i'nqalaLala, and 
the four q'o'minoqa came out. " Hap, hap," said BaxbakualanuXsrwae. 
The k-i'nqalaLala sang and said "hoip," and sometimes the q'o'minoqa 
sang "hai, hai, hai, hai." BaxbakualanuXsi'wae danced. As soon as 
he came to the hole which the men had dug, Ta'wix-amaye pulled away 
the boards with which it was covered. BaxbakualanuXsi'wae was 
looking upward while he was dancing. Then he fell into the hole 
upon the red-hot stones. Then they covered the hole up. Now he was 
dead. As soon as he died all the k'i'n<ialaLala and q'o'minoqa died 
also. The singers also fainted. While they were unable to see, 
Ta'wix-amaye took off all their ornaments of red cedar bark. He took 
the masks and the ha'mats'a pole and the whistles. The old woman 
told him what to do. She taught him the song of BaxbakualanuXsi'wae. 



398 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Wlieu Ta'wix'amaye came home, be told bis father Ntl/nwaqawe what 
had happened. Na'nwaqawe went at once to see BaxbakualanuXsi'- 
wae's house. He followed his sous. When they arrived at the house, the 
woman who was rooted to the floor gave them food and spoke: "My 
dear, Na'nwaqawo, yon shall dance and keep the ha/mats'a mask, the 
raven mask, and the ho'Xhok" mask, and the BaxbakualanuXsI'wae 
mask, and all the different kinds of red cedar bark. The q'o'minoqa 
shall have red and white cedar bark mixed, and the "Bear inside the 
door of this house" shall have whistles. The no'uLtsistalaL shall have 
two whistles and red and white cedar bark. You shall also see how 
the bedroom (ma'wlL) and the ha'mats'a pole are made. You see it 
there, extending through the roof. Here, take the whistles of Bax- 
bakualanuXsi'wae." Thus spoke the woman to Na'nwaqawe. Now the 
woman taught them the songs. She sang the song of the head mask. 
This is the song: 

1. Tho ha'mats'a mask of the forehead, the ha'mats'a mask of the whole workl, the 

pretty mask of that real BaxbakualanuXsI'war-. The ha'mats'a mask of the 
forehead, the ha'mats'a mask of the whole word, the pretty mask, a ma ma ma 
mf' ha nu"'. 

2. The ho'Xhok" mask of the forehead, the ho'Xhok" mask of the whole world, the 

pretty mask of that real BaxbakualaunXsI'war'. The lio'Xhok" mask of the 
forehead, the ho'Xhok" mask of the whole world, the pretty mask, a ma ma ma 
mc ha me. 

3. The raveu mask of the forehead, etc. 

4. The caunibal mask of the forehead, etc. 

Then the woman spoke: " These are the songs of the ha'mats'a mask 
of BaxbakualanuXsi'wae. Xow listen to the song of q'o'minoqa. You 
shall know that she always goes to get food for BaxbakualanuXsI'wae. 
This is the song : 

1. Q'o'mmdqa goes with me around the whole world. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai, hiai, hiai. 

Q'o'minoqa walks all around the world. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai, hiai, hiai. 

2. We are afraid of Q'd'minrxja's body which is covered with blood. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai, 

hiai, hiai. Q'o'minoqa is feared by all because her body is terrible. Hiai, hiai, 
ai, ai, hiai, hiai. 

3. Q'd'minoqa's cedar bark is tied on to you. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai, hiai, hiai. The red 

cedar bark of the whole world is making you voracious. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai. hiai, 
hiai. 

Then the woman spoke again: "That is the song of q'o'minoqa. 
Thus you shall do whenever you initiate a ha'mats'a; then the q'o'mi- 
noqa shall carry a corpse on her arms and she shall feed it to the 
ha'mats'a." Then ISTa/nwaqawe spoke: "My dear, go and teach us all 
you can. Tell us what BaxbakufdanuXsi'wae was doing, and tell us 
all his names." Then the woman spoke: "Now listen, these are his 
names: Qoa'lamk-aslag-ilis (eating alive on earth), and XoXdana (eat- 
ing one man), and Ta'nis (ha'mats'a) and Xa'wik" (having eaten one), 
and La'wck" (having swallowed), and LaxLawek" (swallowing while 
standing), and Ho'kwetaso (wishing to be tamed), and xr»(j[amgasa'lag*i- 
lis (swallowing skulls on earth), and xd'qameLa'lag-ilis k*aso Bax- 
bakualanuXsI'wae (the real BaxbakualanuXsi'wae, swallowing skulls 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 399 

on earth), and QOdana (eating many). And these are the names of the 
q'o'minoqa: Ka/wis (alone on earth), and Lawis k-asd Baxbakualanu- 
Xsi'wae (the real BaxbakuiUannXsI'wae, standing' on earth). 

" All red shall be the cedar bark of the h.Vmats'a, and white and red 
shall be the cedar bark of the q'o'mindqa. 

"And this is the song of the k-i'nqalaLala." Then the woman sang: 

1. Oh, bow nicely you heal your hri'mats'a by your sonj;, by your magical means of 

healing, ma me hania hame. 

2. Oh, how nicely you sing your secret song for your lia'mats'a, your magical secret 

song, ma me haraa hame. 

3. Oh, how nicely you sing your winter ceremonial songs for your hfi'mats'a, your 

magical winter ceremonial sung, ma me hama hame. 

Then the woman stopped singing and spoke: "This is the song of 
the k-i'nqalaLala." Then iSTa'nwaqawe asked the woman: "My dear, 
now tell me who you arel " Then she laughed : " Do you not know who 
I am? I am your daughter. Therefore I resolved to teach you all the 
secrets of the ceremonial of BaxbakualauuXsi'wae." Then Na'nwaqawe 
sj)oke: "(), niydear! J'hanks, that I have seen you again. Xow letus 
go home." Then the woman spoke : " It is impossible for me to go home, 
because I a-m rooted to the ground from my backside. I know it is 
impossible for me to get up from this Hoor, but you must come some- 
times to see me." Then Xa'nwaqawe replied: "Do not say that, child, 
for I can not leave you behind." Ka'nwaqawe tried to dig out the 
root, but it became tlie thicker the deeper he dug. Then Na/nwaqawe 
gave up digging and thought he would cut the root, but the woman 
said: "Do not do that, my dear, else I must die. It is best that you 
come sometimes to see me." Then ISa/nwaqawe gave it up and the 
woman spoke: "Xow let me sing the song of the no'nLtsistalaL." 
Then she sang: 

1. You frightened everyone by your gifts, magical No'nLtsista dancer, hia, hia, liia, ya. 

2. You made everyone i'eel uneasy by your wild cry, magical No'nLtsista dancer, hia, 

hia, hia, ya. 

3. You go all around the word, magical No'nLtsista dancer, hia, hia, ya. You drive 

away everyone by your gifts, magical No'nLtsista dancer, hia, hia, hia, ya, ya, hia, 
ya, ya, hia, hia, hia, ya. 

The woman stopped singing and spoke to Na'nwaqawe : "As soon as 
you get home, give a winter dance. Let Ta'wix-aniaye disappear, he 
shall be lia'mats'a; then four days later (^oa'qoasililag'ilis shall dis- 
api^ear. He shall beq'o'minrxia and get food for that lia'mats'a. Four 
days later Xu'Liloqoe shall disappear. He shall be nd'uLtsistalaL, and 
you, Xa'nwaqawe, shall be the 'bear of the door of your house.' You 
shall have two whistles. And the dancers shall wash every fourth day, 
and atter they have washed four times every fourth day they shall wash 
every sixth day. After they have washed four times every sixth day 
they shall wash every eighth day. After they have washed four times 
every eighth day they shall wash four times every twelfth day. For 
four years the Ha'mats'a shall do no work, else he will die early. Xow

you know the names of all your dancers. Now go home and take the 
name of the house of BaxbakualanuXsI'wae. This is its name: 'Place 
of red cedar bark' (Lfi/qakwatse). That sha41 be the name of your 
house." Now Na/nwaqawe and his sons went home. When they 
arrived, he invited his tribe, and after they had eaten Ta'wix-amaye 
disappeared. Then Na'nwaqawe's tribe tried to find him who was to 
be a ha'mats'a. Na'nwaqawe did all the woman had told him. He 
and his sons were the first to celebrate the winter ceremonial. That 
is how we know about the dances and the different kinds of cedar bark. 
That is the end. 

There exist several versions of this important legend, and I will 
record here another which I obtained from the Awl'k-'enox. Tlie 
beginning is the same as that of the preceding version; but when they 
reach the cannibal's house, it continues as follows : They met a woman 
who was rocking her baby. Opposite her a boy was sitting whose 
head was enormously large. The four brothers went near the lire and 
sat down on a box. When they did so, the eldest one hurt his leg so 
that the blood oozed out of it. Then the boy nudged his mother and 
said: "Mother, I want to lick the blood," but his mother restrained 
him. The boy began to scratch his head and finally commenced licking 
the blood notwithstanding his mother's order. Then the eldest of the 
brothers nudged the youngest one and said : " Oh, why did we not follow 
father's advice?" The boy continued to lick the blood. Then the 
eldest brother took his bow and shot an arrow out of the house through 
the door. He asked his youngest brother to go and bring it back. As 
soon as he had left the house he ran homeward as fast as he could. 
Soon the eldest brother took another arrow and shot it through the 
door. He asked his next youngest brother to fetch it, and he also took 
the opportunity and escaped. Finally he shot a third arrow, and the 
next brother went to fetch it. He also ran homeward as fast as he 
could. Then the boy began to cry. The woman asked the only 
remaining visitor: "Are not yonr brothers coming back?" and he 
replied: "They only went to fetch my arrows." Then he shot a fourth 
arrow and went himself to fetch it. As soon as he had left the house he 
ran homeward. When after some time the brothers did not return, the 
woman knew that they had escaped. She stepped out of the house and 
called her husband: "BaxbakuillanuXsI'wae, I have allowed our good 
dinner to escape." BaxbakualanuXsI'war' heard her, although he was far 
away. He pursued the boys, crying "ham, ham, ham" (eating, eating, 
eating). The four brothers heard him crying, and ran as fast as they 
could. The eldest brother carried a whetstone, a comb, and a bottle of 
hair oil. When BaxbakualanuXsI'wae had come near them, he threw 
his whetstone over his shoulder, and behold! it was transformed into a 
mountain which compelled the pursuer to go round about it. But soon 
he drew nearer again. Then the young man poured the hair oil over 
his shoulder. It was transformed into a lake and the pursuer had to 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 401 

go around it. But again he came near the flying youths. Then the 
young nnin threw his comb over his shoulder. It was transformed into 
an impenetrable thicket. The pursuer had to go all around it, and mean- 
while the three brothers came home. Their father let them in and 
bolted the door. Soon BaxbakurdanuXsT'wae arrived and demanded 
admittance. No'aqaua killed a dog, cut it to pieces, and gathered its 
blood in a dish. Then he invited BaxbakualanuXsrwae to come to a 
knot hole in the wall of his house and offered him the full dish, saying, 
"This is the blood of my sons. Take it and carry it home to your wife. 
Come back tomorrow and 1 will feed you." BaxbakualanuXsI'wae 
took the dish and went home. Then Tsd'ena, Xo'aqaua's wife, made a 
deep ditch and built a huge fire. She put stones into it which when 
red-hot, she threw into the ditch. Then a skin was stretched near the 
fire so as to conceal the ditch. Soon BaxbakurdanuXsT'wae and his 
wife arrived. He had brought his four children. AVhen they went 
into the house, he left his youngest child on the beach to watch the 
canoe. There Tso'ena made them sit close to the fire, their backs 
turned to the skin which concealed the ditch. 

Then BaxbakualanuXsi'wae spoke to Xo'aqaua: "You know how 
everything happened in the beginning of the world. Tell me!" 
No'aqaua replied : " I shall tell you. What shall 1 tell you about what 
happened in the beginning of the world, grandchildren? A cloud was 
on the mountain. Soon you will be asleep." When he had sung so 
twice, BaxbakualanuXsrwae and his whole family were asleep. Then 
No'aqaua and Tso'ena drew the back of their seat and they fell into 
the ditch. They threw the red-hot stones on top of them. Twice 
BaxbakualanuXsi'wae cried "ham, ham!" then he was dead. After 
some time they pulled out the bodies. Xd'aqaua cut them to pieces and 
scattered them in all directions, singing: "BaxbakualanuXsi'wae, you 
shall pursue man." They were transformed into mosquitoes. 

Here is another legend explaining the initiation of the Oe'alitx, a 
subdivision of the He'iltsuq. 

A woman named Ts'u'mkwalaqas came to the Stikine Eiver. There 
she gave birth to a boy who was at once transformed into a stone. It is 
now a large mountain at the Stikine. It has a name, but I do not know 
it. She had two brothers whose names were Wa'k-as and Do'kwa- 
lesala living in a village at Goose Island. She wanted to go to see her 
brothers. She went on in her canoe and came to the Skeena River. 
There she gave birth to a boy. He was also transformed into stoire. It 
is now a large mountain at Skeena River named Kuga. Again she was 
with child. She came to Xa'exaes. There she gave birth to a boy, 
who was also transformed into stone. It is now a large mountain at 
Xa'exaes named Gugasp'its'awe. Again she was with child. She 
started in her canoe and came to Dfi'yasiowe. There she built a house 
of cedar bark. After four days she gave birth to dogs. 

Then she used to go digging clams on the beach in front of her house 
NAT MUS 95 26 



402 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

to get food for her cliildreii. Now the young' dogs began to grow up. 
At night when it was low water, she went down to tlie beach carrying 
a torch, and dug clams. Then she heard a sound like the singing of 
many children. Ts'u'mkwalaqas wanted to know who the children 
were. She put her digging stick into the ground, took oif her cape, and 
hung it over the stick. Thus she made it look like a person. Then she 
went to see who was singing. She looked through a hole and saw now 
that her children were all boys. Then she was watching them and 
learned their song, and the song is sung in the He'iltsuq language: 

1. Spread ou the floor, Aiha! 

2. Down the stream of the world. Aiha! 

Now she jumped into the liouse and said: "You have no father and 
you are men. I must always work hard to gather food for you." Only 
the youngest one put on his dogskin in time before the woman had 
taken the skins and thrown them into the fire. Then the eldest spoke: 
" Don't let us sit like fools; let us begin to work and help our mother." 
He continued: "What work shall I do for my mother? I shall be a 
wood carver." The second brother said : "I will be her canoe builder." 
The third brother said: "What work shall I do for my mother? I will 
be the killer of monsters." Then the dog spoke: "I will be her dog 
and watch that no sickness comes near her. I shall bark when an 
invisible spirit approaches." Now it grew dark. On the following 
morning the wood carver carved figures of men and he carved house 
posts of different forms — in the shape of all kinds of fish and land ani- 
mals. It is said the i)osts were as long as a forefinger. He made eight 
houses, and then he made one more house. He made it pretty; it had 
a front carved in the shape of a raven. He built another one with the 
front carved in the shape of Wiganx-tx, and he made still another one- 
eleven houses in all. And the canoe builder built toy canoes. He 
made many. 

At night the wood carver took the houses and put them on the ground 
on each side of his mother's house. The large house was in the middle 
of that village. Then the canoe builder put his toy cauoes in front of 
the houses. In the morning Ts'u'mkwalaqas went out. What should 
she see but many people and large canoes. Now she was rich. The 
wood carver went to the small river near by and made a salmon trap. 
He carved salmon of alder wood. Therefore the flesh of the salmon is 
red. On the following day he went to look after his salmon trap. He 
found one fish in it and gave it to his mother, who cut it open and dried 
it. On the following day he went again to look after his salmon trap. 
He found eight salmon. He went home, carrying them on his finger, 
and gave them to his mother. Then he told his mother to look after 
the trap from time to time. The killer of monsters had killed by this 
time all the monsters living in the sea near the coast. 

Then the brothers said they would go into the woods. In the morn- 
ing they went, and the wood carver was the leader. At night they 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 403 

rested under a cedar tree. It had not been dark very long when thej^ 
heard a sound far away, " Wanio ino-nio ino-waniO-mo-mo-mo." That 
means : Kiver, river, run, run, run, run. The three brothers were fright- 
ened. iSTow the sound came closer, closer, and closer. They heard it 
four times, and every time nearer. They did not know what made the 
sound. Then they heard another noise, "hahi, hi, hi, ahl, haliT, hi, hi, 
ahi, hi, hi, hi, ahl, hi, hi, hi." (This is the cry of Q'o'minoqa.) 

They heard the cries four times, and they came nearer every time. 
Then the wood carver said : ''I wonder what produces this sound," and 
the canoe builder said: "Do not talk too much; are you not afraid!" 
Then they heard a sound again, "hap, hap, hap, hap, hap, hap, hap." 
(This is the cry of BaxbakualauuXsI'wae.) They heard the sound four 
times, and it came nearer every time. Now the sound stopped close to 
the place where they were sitting. Then the killer of monsters said: 
"Let us go and see what makes the noise." They all went, and after 
a short time they saw a large house. Sparks were coming out of the 
roof. They entered, and a man came and told the brothers to sit down 
on the right-hand side of the house. Then the speaker of the winter 
ceremonial said: " iS^ow watch, brothers; now you will get a magic 
treasure." Then the Xo'nLEmg-ila came in and danced. It was he 
who always said "wamo-mo-mo-mo." As soon as he had finished, the 
speaker of the winter ceremonial said: "Watch his dance. We call 
him No'nLEmg'ila. It shall be your dance." Next Q'o'minoqa came 
and sang " hahl, hi, hi, hi, ahi, hahi, hi, hi, ahi!" 

Then she danced. When she had finished, the speaker of the winter 
ceremonial said: "It shall be your dance. Her name will be GaLgi- 
yots'enox, or invisible spirit. Now take care of that dance." Thus 
spoke the speaker of the winter ceremonial to the brothers: "White 
and red is her dancing ornament." Then the brothers heard far off 
the ha'mats'a's cry "hap, hap." Now it sounded near the door of the 
dancing house. BaxbakualanuXsi'wae came.in and cried "hap" in the 
doorway of the house, and the people sang for him. This is his song: 

1. The whole world speaks of the strength of the mouth of BaxbakualanuXsi'wae. 

Ilamai, hamamai, hamai, hamamai. 

2. Frightened is the whole world of the month of Ba.xbakurdauuXeiI'wae. Hamai, 

hamamai, hamai, hamamai. 

3. For four men searched the strength of the month of BaxbakurilauuXsi'war'. 

Hamai, hamamai, hamai, hamamai. 

I do not know the song of No'nLEmg'ila and Q'o'minoqa. Now the 
brothers came home. Then the wood carver disappeared. He was 
taken away by BaxbakufilanuXsi'wae. After four days thecanoe builder 
disappeared. He was taken away by No'nLEmg-ila. That is how the 
winter dance of Oe'alitx originated. That is the end. 

I will give still another legend of an initiation by BaxbakurdanuXsI'- 
wae. It belongs to the clan (x-e'xsEiu of the T'Ena'xtax. 
The first of the T'Eua'xtax lived at Le'kwade. Their chief was 



404 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Lii'wag'is. He was in love with a girl. Once npou a lime she went up 
the liver to pick berries, and La'wag-is foHowed her. He walked along 
the bank of the river, while she had gone up in her canoe. When it grew 
dark, he heard cries iu the. woods. Then he Jumped into a pond and 
rubbt'd his body with hemlock branches. He went on. He heaixl the 
cries all the time and bathed in another pond. He walked on. Now 
the cries were close to him. He bathed again. Now the cries came 
quite close to him. He bathed the fourth time. As soon as he had 
finished, he saw a woman with a large head and matted hair and with 
a face which was full of scratches. La'wag'is went up to her and put 
his arm around her waist. As soon as he had done so they both fainted. 
He recovered first, but he put his arms around her waist only tighter. 
Then the woman with the great head recovered and spoke: "I am the 
crier of the woods. Now let me go and I will help you to obtain every- 
thing easily. I will be your magical helper. You shall obtain easily all 
kinds of property." La/wag-is only held her more tightly. Then she 
spoke again: "I will raise property for you." But he held her still 
tighter. Then she spoke again : " I will give you the water of life. Let 
me go." But he held her still tighter. She spoke again: "Let me go. 
Take my name, it shall be yours. You will be Qon'dasgamals. I will 
give you the apron that burns everything." Then he let her go. She 
disappeared at once. She only left the four gifts, which she had given 
him, on the ground. Then La'wag-is took his magical treasures. He 
went on and tried his apron against the trees of a mountain. Imme- 
diately they were burnt, and you can see even now that the mountains 
of Ts'a'wate are burnt. Now he was glad. He hid his magical treas- 
ures under a cedar tree and went on. He arrived at the village where 
his sweetheart was living. She asked him: "Why did you not come 
sooner?" He replied: "I lost my way." That night they went to bed 
and played together. After a short time he was poked in the side 
through a hole which was in the boards of the house. He arose and 
went to look. As soon as he went out his face was covered and he was 
led away by a man. He did not dare to speak and to ask, but he knew 
that he was led three times up a mountain and three times down. Dur- 
ing all this time his face was not uncovered. Then he knew they were 
going up a mountain again, and he heard a cry, " hap, hap, hap ; hao, hao ; 
gao, gao" (the cries of the ha'mats'a, the ho'Xhok", and of the raven.) 
Then the man spoke: "My dear, do not be afraid. I want to give you 
magical power. This is my house. I am BaxbakualanuXsT'wae. You 
shall see everything in my house." They entered, and he uncovered the 
faceof La'wag-is. " Now look, friend !" said BaxbakualauuXsrwae. You 
shall have my name, AVilgasfi'lag-ilis, and your name shall be Ha/mats'a. 
Now watch the dau.ce of the ha'mats'a." Then he heard the cries, "hap, 
hap, hap ; had, hao ; gao, gao." Then the raven that was painted on the 
front of the hil'mats'a's secret room opened its mouth and the ha'mats'a 
came out, vomited by the raven. Then he danced. La'wag-is did not 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS, 405 

see the singers. After the first song the ha'mats'a went back and the 
ho'Xhok" came out and danced. After one dance he went back and the 
raven came out and danced. With the next song the ha/mats'a came 
out carrying a corpse in his arms, which he ate. When he had eaten it, 
he danced again and Aveut back. He had four songs. BaxbakualanuX- 
sl'wac spoke: "This shall be your ha/mats'a, your name shall be Wil- 
gasfi'Iag'ilis, and Hamiga'lagalits'ak" and Naxuawisa'lag'ilis. Don't 
forget the head masks of the ho'Xhok" and of the raven and the paint- 
ing of the secret room. He called La'wag-is to see a ditch that was in 
the rear of the house. Then he went and saw it. Something like a 
rainbow was standing in the hole. La'wag-is looked down and saw all 
kinds of animals and fishes in the hole. BaxbakualanuXsi'wac spoke: 
"This is the cannibal post of the dancing house. This shall be your 
magical treasure. Then he taught him his song: 

1. You are the great BaxbakualanuXsl'wae, to whom every one looks np, ahd, 6, o, o, 

hem, aem. 

2. This is the way of the true BaxbakufilanuXsI'wae, aho, o, o, o, hf'iu, aeni. 

3. O, nobody can live before the great BaxbaknalauuXsi'war', aho, n, d, d, h<'m, aem. 

4. Who came out of tlie woods to me, aho, d, d, d, hem, aem. 

Kow he had learned the one song and BaxbakualanuXsl'wae taught 
him the second song: 

1. You are looking for food, you great magician, mahamai, hama, hamamai; yi 

hama ma mai hama. 

2. You are looking for men whom you want to eat, great magician; mahamai, 

hama, hamamai ; yi hama ma mai hama. 

3. You tear men's skins, great magician, mahamai. You try to eat many men, great 

magician, mahamai, hama, hamamai; yi hama ma mai hama. 

4. Everybody trembles before you, you great magician. You who have been to the 

end of the world, mahamai, hama hama mai; yi hama ma mai hama. 

After the song BaxbakuillanuXsi'wae called La'wag-is and asked 
him: "Don't you want this harpoon shaft? It kills everything. Xow 
it is yours, and also this red cedar bark and the fire with which you may 
burn everything, the water of life, and tiie quartz for killing your ene- 
mies." Then La'wag-is went home. That is the end. 

The following legend belongs to the Ximkish: 

There were two friends. One of them had gone into the woods to be 
initiated by the spirits of his clan, while the other one was not yet pre- 
pared to meet these spirits. Nevertheless he went to search for his 
friend and after four days he found him. When he returned, his father 
asked him where he had been, and he told him that he had found his 
friend who was being instructed by the spirits. Then his father struck 
him, saying: "Do you not know that it is forbidden? I shall be killed 
on account of you.'' Then the youth became sad. At night he put on 
his ornaments, which were made of abalone shells, and went into the 
woods. He went up the river and washed with hemlock branches. 
The following morning he went on, and the next day he waslied again. 
Then he heard the voice of BaxbaknalanuXsi'wac. At the end of the 



406 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

fourth day be came to a precipice and lay down at its base to rest. 
Early in tlie morning- lie saw the rock open and out came Baxba- 
kurdanuXsi'wae. He hid, and the spirit tlew away over liis head. His 
body was all covered with red cedar bark. Four days the boy stayed 
there. On the fifth morning' when J>axbakualanuXsT'war' came out 
again, he followed him, and saw how he took oft his cedar bark orna- 
ments on the bank of a pond and weut to swim in it. Wheuhe dived, 
the youth Jumped forward and put on the cedar bark ornaments. Now 
the spirit emerged. When he saw the boy decked with his cedar bark 
ornaments, he said : "You have done well to take my ornaments. Now 
I can do you no harm.'' He took him along to his home inside the 
rock. There he asked him: "What do you want to have? Do you 
want this harpoon f Do you want the water of life? Bo you want the 
death-bringer? Do you want my ha'matsa?" He gave him all of 
these. The youth stayed with him for four days. Then he was able 
to fly. Then BaxbakuahmuXsi'wae instructed him to fly to a place 
where his father was accustomed to fetch Avater for cooking. Soon his 
younger brother came, and w^heu he saw him, he discovered that he 
had been away a long time. What had seemed to him four days were 
actually four years. He asked the young boy: "How is father? I am 
your elder brother. Go and ask father to clean his house." The boy 
went back and told his father, who beat him for speaking of his dead 
son. Then the boy ran back and complained to his brother that his 
father had beaten him for carrying the message. The elder brother 
sent him back to the house, asking him to repeat his re(iuest. The boy 
obeyed and when his father had heard the message again, he went out 
to see by himself. As soon as his eldest son saw him he grew excited. 
He flew across the river to the graveyard, tore corpses out of their 
coffins and devoured them. Then he flew into his father's house and 
bit everyone whom he saw. 

There are a number of tales referring to the acquisition of the 
hd'Xhok". The Naqo'mg-ilisala have the following legend on this 
subject:^ 

A number of women went to the island Yu'lc to dig fern roots. They 
put some dried whale meat over the Are and a red-breasted owl came 
and picked up some of it. It is said that there are many red-breasted 
owls there. Then all of a sudden came the ho'Xhok" and alighted on 
top of a tree. He came downward, pecking the tree. He came down 
to the bottom of the tree, but it was hard on his beak. Now he walked 
up to the women. He covered his nose and was transformed into a 
man. He reached a woman who put some dry whale on the fire. She 
laid a mat before him and put the whale meat on it. The ho'Xhok" 
said : "I do not eat whale meat, I eat only man's brain." So saying, he 
pecked the woman's head, broke her skull, and ate the brain. One of 
the women had hidden wiien he came down. She went home and told 
the tale. Then the Naqo'mg-ilisala resolved to make war upon the 
ho'Xhok". Qo'mg-ustals and Waxalalaa took the blood of a woman 

' Appendix pacje 680. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 407 

aud washed themselves. Then they made war on the ho'Xhok". ]S"ow 
they went to where the women had been. They i)nt whale meat on the 
fire. At once many owls came there and the ho'Xhok" aligiited on 
the tree. jSTow he came downward, iiecking the tree. When he came 
to the foot of the tree, he jnmped. His beak stuck in a crack of the 
tree. Then (^o'mg-nstals and Waxalalaa ran up to him and broke off 
his nose and pushed him into tlie tire. He was dead. That is the end. 

The following tradition of the Awl'k-'enox referring to the ho'Xhok" 
is of interest because it indicates the ceremonial or dance performed 
by every novice initiated by this being: 

A young man named Q-'o'mkilig-a went into the woods to fetch cedar 
bark. There the ho'Xhok" scented him. He found that the youth was 
clean, and therefore rushed down upon him in order to abduct him. 
When Q'*o'mkilig"a heard the spirit coming, lie trembled with fear. He 
hoped to master his fears by smoking, but he failed. He fainted and 
lay like one dead. The ho'Xhok" came down to him and imbued him 
with his powers. 

When the yonth did not return, his friends went into the woods to 
search for him. They found him lying in a deep swoon. They sprin- 
kled him with cold water, but he did not awake. They carried him 
back to the village. When his father saw him, his heart was sad. But 
soon he noticed that he was still alive. He called a shaman and bade 
him heal his son. The shaman ordered the house to be swept and the 
floor to be strewn with sand. He took the youth into the woods and 
stayed there for four days. Then he returned. After four days more 
Q'o'mkilig-a also returned. He had received the name QoaLqoa'oe. 

He sang of the hd'Xhok", and suddenly he jumped up in order to 
devour his father, wlio was sitting on the opposite side of the fire. He 
had the cedar-bark ornaments of the ha'mats'a around his neck and head. 
His head ring slid down and fell right over his mouth, so that instead 
of biting his father he bit a piece out of his ring. Plis grandfather took 
a large blaclv blanket which he wound around the youth's head. He 
tore it with his teeth. Then the people wound a rope over his mouth ; he 
tore it. Xobody was able to subdue him. All the people fled out of 
the door for fear. They heard him singing in the house and looked 
through the chinks and through the knot holes to see what he was 
doing. They vsaw him climbing the posts and pushing the roof boards 
aside. He wanted to pursne the people. Then the^^ stationed two 
men at the doors, and others held the roof down so that he should not 
escape. Others entered and threw a bearskin over him. But he crept 
about in the house and his skin was so slii^pery that nobody could 
hold him. In the evening he quieted down and lay so still that the 
people thought he miglit be asleep. They made a jacket of cedar bark 
in which they tried to catch him. But as soon as they approached he 
jumi)ed up and ran out of the house. On the island Xalkuitxoi'as there 
were a number of women engaged splitting salmon. He scented them 
and jumped into the water to devour them. They escaped in their 
canoe when they saw him coming. 



408 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

At last QoaLqoiVoe recovered his senses. He si^oke to his father: 
"When I grow excited again, do not try to defend yourself, I shall do 
you no harm." After a short time he fell again into a state of ecstasy. 
He lay flat on the floor, his face downward. The people threw a net 
made of cedar bark over him, in order to catcli liim. Sometimes they 
succeeded in placing a foot on his neck, but they were unable to hold 
him, not even by winding his long hair around their hands. He 
escaped, and nobody knew what had become of him. He ran about in 
the woods and when he came back to the village he bit whomsoever he 
met. When he recovered his senses, he asked his father to boil oulachon 
oil and to give it to him as soon as he fell into a renewed ecstasy, as 
this would restore his senses. Once when he was excited, he scented 
the mussels in a canoe which was approaching the village, but which 
was still far away. He ran down to the beach and as soon as the canoe 
landed he ate all the mussels that were in it. Then he became quiet. 

Another group of initiating spirits are the ghosts; their proteges 
are the ghost dancers. Following is a legend of the L'a'sq'enox regard- 
ing the origin of the ghost dance:' 

Cxoa'xLa and his children lived in a village in heaven. His sons 
were Qo'masdox, the eldest one, Hai'aqoalaL, tlie next, No'lak-as the 
following, and A'n(iolak-as. His rival was TsilqoaloLEla. He had 
three sons, Sepa'xis and YaqanLamaye and G-e'xdEu. Then Tsi'lqoalo- 
LEla wanted to come down to our world. He made a copper ladder 
on which he was going to climb down with l)is children. His rival 
wanted him to pay for it.C?) !N"ow Goa'xLa heard what Tsi'lqoaloLEla 
had said. Then he walked and walked for four days. All of a sudden, 
he saw a mountain growing up from this our world reaching up to the 
sky. Then he went home and told his sons. They got ready and came 
to the i)lace where he had been before. After a little while they saw 
the mountain rising up again. As soon as it reached heaven Goa/xLa 
said to his sons: •'! shall not follow you. Go now and call your tribe 
the Pe'pawiLenox. You shall take my dancing implements." Thus 
he spoke to his sons. Then Qo'masdox and Hai'aqoalaL and No'lak-as 
and also A'nqolak-as came down to liaspberry Beach. Then they went 
on looking for a river. They were walking in the woods and came to 
(;ape Cook. There they found a pole at the point of Cape Cook. Then 
Qo'milsdox and Hai'aqoalaL went back, keeping close to the beach. 
They came to Ots'o'lis and went to the head of the bay. There they 
saAv smoke. They came up to it and saw a house, which they entered. 
There were two women who were roasting clams. Then Qo'masdox 
and Hai'aqofdaL asked the women: "Where do you come from?" The 
women replied : "We came from the upper world and we have no hus- 
bands." Then (^Id'masdox said, "We have no wives. How did you 
come down?" Then Wryolcueqa, one of the women, spoke: "These 
geese brought us down here and we came to be your wives." The 
brothers were glad on hearing this and they went home with their 

' Appendix page 681. See ulso page 335. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 409 

wives Wi'yoleneqa aud WiyoLasoguilak". Wheu they came to Easp- 
berry Beach, the womeu were with child. They gave birth to boys, 
and Qo'infisdox gave his son the iiau)e La'qoasqEm. Tlie boys grew 
up quickly. One day the children were playing at the river at one 
end of Easpberry Beach. Then Lfi/qoasqEui fainted on that side of 
tke river. The other boy went back to tell Qo'masdox. He came at 
once to look after his son, aiul really, he was dead. He buried him 
immediately. In the evening the boy returned to life, but what could 
he do? He was inside the coffin box. At night he heard people talk- 
ing to each other. Then he was able to open the cover of the box. 
Eight away he was called and they went to a house in which beating 
of boards was heard. Three ghosts were asked to take care of the 
boy. Then they led him into the dancing house, but they did not go 
to the rear of the house. They sat in the middle of the right hand 
side. Now they spoke to La/qoasqEm: "Now take care, remember 
what you see aud the songs which you will hear. Don't eat of the 
food they offer you." There was a chief standing in the house holding 
a rattle. His name was Ha'mamaxayals. He was chief of all the 
ghosts. He said, " Come, let my boy go to the rear of the house." 
But the three ghosts replied, " He is alive." They finished their dance. 
The boy felt uneasy. Then Ha'mamaxayals said: "Take care, my 
tribe. We will take that little boy to his house." Then all the ghosts 
took some moss and pat it on their heads. Then the little boy also 
put some moss on his head. At once he sat on the ground of our own 
world. A shaman named He/Lilalag-ilis was told to take some urine to 
wash the people. Then all the ghosts cried "hamama/" where he was 
sitting. Qo'masdox and his wife were eating when they heard the 
sound, "hamama', hamama'." He ran out of his house to look, and 
there he saw his son sitting on the ground. He called his wife, 
"Come." His wife came to see and recognized her own son. Then 
Lfi'qoasqEm called his father, "Go and take some urine to sprinkle 
your people with." Qo'masdox brought his chamber. Then the 
whole tribe came. But the ghosts opened their mouths. As soon 
as a person passed their mouths while they were saying "hamama/" 
he died. Theu La'qoasqEm shouted, "Sprinkle some urine on the 
people." As soon as it was done all those who had been dead resur- 
rected. Then he entered his father's house and with him came the 
noise of the ghosts. The boy was singing their song and the tribe 
learned it from him. Thus they learned the song of the ghosts. Now 
listen to the song of the boy! His name was NenLaxstals, now that 
he was ghost dancer. No other kind of dance and carving came to 
him. This is his song: 

1. Yii xamami', yii xamani*", ya xamainr- ya. 
Now ghosts, go all to that upper world ! 

2. Ya xamamr", ya xamaraf', ya xamanio ya. 

For great is your wealth in the ground, ghosts! 

3. Ya xamamC', ya xamamO, ya xamame ya. 

For great is your iirc aud many your hot stones, ghosts! 



410 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1805. 

The origin of the sumise dauce is given as follows : 
Knf'xala'lag'ilis and his tribe, the first of the G-o'p'euox, were living 
at G-e'damis. At that time it was always dark and it never grew day- 
light. The first G-O'p'euox were sad. Then Nag-eisilakua invited his 
tribe. As soon as they had all assembled in the chief's house he spoke: 
"G'o'p'enox! I did not invite yon to eat. I will talk about our world. 
It is not good that it never gets daylight. ^o^\ deliberate, councilors 
of the G-o'p'enox, how we can obtain the daylight for our world. That 
is what I wanted to say." He stopped speaking and an old man named 
Yaqautayig-ilak", the father of Kuexala'lag-ilis, said: " Ya, G-o'p'enox, 
let us try to find where Nenalaats'eqa is living and let us go to her. 
Then another old man said : " My tribe, she is living at Xua/tis; and it 
is said that she keei^s the sun in her box. Let us go and make war 
upon the Koskimo, for Nenalaats'eqa is of their tribe. Let us take 
away the daylight that she is keeping in her box." With this the old 
man stopped speaking. ThenKuexala'lag-ilis, who had magical powers, 
said: "My tribe, you all know I am Knexala'lag'ilis; 1 have magical 
powers. Do not make war upon the Koskimo, for I will go to Nena- 
laats'eqa with my friend Ts'eqaxsdo'kuilak". Now, make yourself 
ready, my friend ! Let us go to Xua'tis. But you, my tribe, take care 
lest misfortune should befall me." Then all the people said: "We 
are gladdened after having been downcast, because you have magical 
powers and therefore you always succeed in your undertakings." ^ow 
Kuexala'lag'ilis and Ts'eqaxsdo'kuilak" started. The former said to 
his friend : '' We will not go right to Xua/tis. I will go to the woods and 
try to find a really supernatural power. Do not get out of patience 
if you have to wait for me for a long time, else we shall not con- 
quer Nenalaats'eqa. Hide here and do not let anyone see you." Then 
he left the canoe and went into the woods at night. After a short time 
he discovered the squirrel. Kuexala'lag-ilis. spoke to him and asked: 
"What are you doing here, friend?" The squirrel replied: "I am i)ick- 
ing crab apples." He asked in his turn: "What are you doing here?'' 
Kuexala'lag'ilis replied : "I am trying to bathe in that lake, that I may 
obtain possession of the box in which is our sun, and which Nr-na- 
laats'iMja is keeping." The squirrel said : "Do you not know how to 
transform yourself into a baby and enter Xenalaats'eqa's womb? 
Then, when you are born, you must cry for the box." Then Kuexa- 
la'lag-ilis was glad to have the advice of his friend the squirrel. He 
went to his canoe and told his friend: "You may go home. I am not 
going with you, and do not worry if I stay away long." He pushed 
the canoe into the water and Ts'eqaxsdo'kuilak" paddled home to 
G-e'damis. He told the G-d'p'enox what had ha])pened. 

Then Kuexala'lag-ilis walked until he saw the village at Xua/tis. 
There he saw Nenalaats'eqa sitting in her house, eating salmon. 
Then he transformed himself into a baby and entered her womb. She 
vomited at once. Her belly swelled rapidly and after four days she

gave biitli to a boy. \Mieii lie was one day old, lie was able to walk, 
and the following day lie began to talk. When the child was fonr days 
old, it began to cry for the box. Then Nenalaats'Oqa gave it to the 
boy. He stopped crying at ouce. On the following day the child went 
playing in the canoe. Then NT'nalaats'r'qa told her si^eaker to push 
the hunting canoe into the water. The boy went aboard the canoe and 
then he began again to cry for the box. His mother told her speakers 
to put the box into the canoe. Then the boy stopped crying. He 
pushed oft" the canoe and went far away from the shore with the tide. 
Then an old man said to Nenalaats'eqa: "What have you been doing? 
Is that the box in which the day is that is now in the bow of the canoe 
of that child? Do you not know him! That is Kuexala'lag-ilis." 
Thns spoke the old man. As soon as Kuexala'lag-ilis had rounded 
the point, he opened the box. Then he took out the sun and removed 
his sT'siuL mask. It grew light at once. The sun spoke: "O, friend! 
do not keep me ! Let me go to the upper world, for now I will try 
to benefit our world. It will be day now. You have my si'siuL 
mask." Thus spoke the sun. Then Kuexala'lag-ilis replied : "Do not 
go just yet, friend! You may go to the upper world when we arrive 
among my own tribe at G-c'damis. They all will praise you." Then 
he paddled home. The sun said: "My friend! treat my si'siuL mask 
well. You may show it during the winter dance, and also the sunrise 
mask. Its name shall be KXts'amatusElag-ilis (abaloue shell from 
one end of the world to the other). That is all." Thus spoke the sun 
and bid farewell to Kucxala'lag'ilis. Then he went to the upjDcr world. 
In this manner the G-o'p'enox obtained the sunrise mask (na'xnak*a- 
qEuiL) and its red cedar bark. It was inside the box. That is the end. 
(See figs. 129-133, p. 484.) 

The Ma'tEm ceremonial derives its origin from the following legends 
of the Nimkish : 

At Papek-in, above Nimkish Lake, lived a young man named O'mea- 
LEmae. He was always playing with other children. One night he was 
very hungry. He took salmon roe out of a box and roasted it. When 
the roe burst, some of it jumped against the neck of the boy's father, 
who was sitting near the fire warming his back. He grew angry and 
struck Ma'tEm with a stick. The boy became sad and went into the 
woods. After walking a long time he came to a place where there was 
a jam of driftwood in the river. He wanted to die, and he jumped into 
the water above the jam, but he came up again below, none the worse 
for his long dive. He came to a second jam and jumped into the river 
above it, but he came up below hale and well. Then he arrived at a 
steep clift". He climbed up and flung himself down the precij)ice, but 
he did not hurt himself. He went on and soon he arrived at a mountain 
which was resi)lendent with light. It was the clift' Na'oalakoa. There 
it was raining quartz all the time. He took up four crystals and placed 
them in a row on the medial line of his head. He climbed the mouu- 



412 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

taiu and his whole body was covered with crystal. Soon he became 
aware that with the crystal he had attained the power of flying. Then 
he flew all through the world. He believed that he had been absent 
for four days, but in reality there had been as many years. Finally he 
returned to his village. His clan happened to be at ISTe/nelk-as fishing 
on the lake by the light of torches. 

Then he appeared in the shape of a white eagle and quartz was rain- 
ing down where he was seen. He alighted on a tree and sang — 




Ha-a ha a ha a ha ha-a nil ha a a ne. 

Then the people knew that he had returned and that he had obtained 
magical power from Ma'tEm. They bathed and went down to the shore, 
each carrying a staff to which a crystal had been fastened. But 
O'meaLEmae, whose name was now Ma'tEm, smelled them and did not 
allow himself to be caught. When it grew dark, he was soaring over 
the houses. In vain the people tried to catch him. One of his old play- 
mates was very anxious to catch him. He made a loop of cedar bark 
rope and succeeded in throwing it over the bird's head. The latter 
continued soaring about. The youth, who now received the name 
Ma'taanoe, followed him. He asked the people to sweep the house 
and to iflacG a jdank on the roof. When they had done so, Ma'tEm 
alighted on the plank. Three times he flew up again, but the foarth 
time he came down into the house, accompanied by Ma'tnanoe. 

Later on Ma'tEm went out with his slaves to cut wood. His canoe 
capsized and he descended to Be'benaqaua. There he saw many 
dances and he received the lolo'LalaL, the ghost dance, and the name 
Ld'i.Emae. 

I obtained another version of this tale from a Kwakiutl, although 
the tale belongs also to the Nimkish: 

A youth was in the habit of spending his time with his sweetheart 
and notwithstanding the urgent appeals of his mother he refused to 
marry. Late one night he came home and asked his mother to prepare 
food for him. She was angry and said: "Go back to the place where 
you came from and get your feed there. I shall not give you any- 
thing." Then the youth was sad. He lay down and remained in bed 
four days without partaking of any food. His mother began to worry 
and asked him to rise, but he did not listen. Then she called the 
youth's sweetheart to call him, but he did not listen to her either. At 
last, after four days, he arose and went into the woods without knowing 
where he went. He had lost his senses. He came to a lake. There he 
threw off his clothing and swam and dived in the lake. He remained 
under water for a long time. Wlien he canu'- up again, a totem pole 
rose with him. He said, " 1 do not want you," and thought, "I will go 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 413 

ou." After some time he came to another lake. Again he swam and 
dived. When he came up, a seal harpoon came up with him, but he 
did not want to have it. He was trying- to tind the bird Ma'tEm. He 
came to a third and to a fourth pond, and after having bathed he knew 
that he would find the bird. He put on his blanket and went ou. 
Soon he saw the bird, which was flying ahead of him. He threw off 
his blanket in order to be able to follow him more rapidly. Suddenly 
the bird turned and called, "What do you want of me?" The youth 
replied, "My mother maltreated me. ^^ow I came to find a magical 
treasure." The bird retorted : " Do you see you mountain "i That is my 
abode. Let us climb it!" He flew ahead and the youth followed him. 
When they had arrived at Ma'tEm's house, the bird gave him quartz 
and other thiugs, the water of life, the fire of death, and the seal har- 
poon. He put the quartz crystals into the youth's Joints and thus he 
obtained the powerof flying. He sent him to the mountain Ts'i'lk-impae 
(feathers on top) in the far north, in order to get eagle down for his 
dances. The youth started on his journey. When he approached the 
mountain, it was snowing, hailing, and raining. The people who lived 
near the mountain keep great fires burning in order to see and to catch 
everyone who comes to the mountain wanting to get eagle down. But 
by the help of the quartz the youth iJassed them without being seen. 
He gathered the eagle down, and thus obtained the power of assuming 
the shape of a bird. Then he returned to his own village in the shape 
of a bird. When his younger brother saw the bird approaching, he 
laid a snare to catch it. The bird put the snare over its own neck and 
resumed his human shape. He sent word to his father, asking him to 
clean his house. When this was done, he came home in the evening 
and danced as Ma'tBm. On the following morning the bird Ma'tEm 
brought a totem pole and threw it down in front of the youth's house. 

The Me'iLa is a legend which belonged originally to the He'iltsuq 
and Awl'k-'enox. I obtained the following tale from the Awi'k*'endx 
regarding its origin: 

A young man named Me'iLa went ten times inside of one year uj) to the 
sky. On his first visit he found a gull, which he brouglit down. On his 
second visit he found a puftin ( ?) ; ou his third visit the salmon berries, 
then a diver (a bird) and the bird xe'xexe. After his sixth visit he 
brought the bird atE'mkuli. But Avhen he had gone up the tenth time 
he did not return again. His mother, Leelaiaqs, and his father, 
Q'omxto-is, mourned for him. Finally they fell asleep. His mother 
thought that in her dream she saw a beautiful house, but on awaking 
slie recognized that what she believed to have been a dream was real. 
The house was near by, and her son Me/iLa was sitting in front of it. 
She awakened her husband that he might see him. They Jumped up 
and ran toward the house. But it retreated from them, and tinally they 
saw that it was in reality up in heaven. Then they sat down and cried, 
singing "Our sou is iu heaven playing with Nusnu'sElis (the moon).

Never will lie return to ns." When they 
were thus singing-, their niece passed by 
them, and they told her that they had 
seen Me'iLa playing in front of the moon's 
house. Their niece said, " Let us make 
him appear in our dances." The parents 
of the boy agreed and let their nier^e 
Q'oqome'tsEmqa perform the Me'iLa 
dance. They gave her his name. 

In a number of cases the dance or the 
powers obtained by the ancestor are also 
represented on the totem carvings. I will 
give a few examples of this kind: 

There were the fi rst of the Qoe'xsot'euox 
at He'qams. LaliliLax came to be their 
chief. Now, he said he wanted to go to 
the river of Ga/ynx to see if the sockey- 
salmon went up the river. He went far 
up, but did not lind a single salmon. 
Then he forgot why he had gone up the 
river. He felt dizzy. All of a sudden he 
saw a pretty man sitting on a stone. His 
face was like that of a bird. The man did 
not see Lfi'liliLax. The latter went up 
to him and stood behind him while the 
other was not turning his head. He said, 
"Friend, Avhat are you doing here"?" 
Now the man turned his head and spoke: 
^^ Thank you, friend, that you came so 
that I could see you. 1 am the one who 
thunders from the one end to the other 
end of the world." La/liliLax replied: 
"(), master, 1 came here for your sake. 
Now give me a magic treasure." Then 
the man spoke: "Make a house and in- 
vite all the tribes." He showed him the 
carving of the thunder bird, with two 
spread legs. They say it was as long as 
a forefinger. The man spoke: " Its legs 
are the door of the house. This is my 
ornament of red cedar bark around its 
head. The heads on it were given tome 
by my father that I should eat them. 
This image of a man you shall place in 
the rear of your house. It is the image 
of my father. (Plate 22.) In the coming

night this shall be in your village. These shall be your magic treasures : 
the water ot life, the death bvinger, and the tire bringer which will 
destroy your enemies, and the property bringer. Now you are a chief. 
You will be a thunder dancer, and your name shall be KukunXpalisila, 
the one who thunders from the one end of the world to the other, and 
human heads will be on your cedar 
bark rings and on your neck ring, 
and your chief's name shall be 
Ya/qaLEnlis (property on body)." 
Then tlie man disappeared. La'lili- 
Lax went home. His wife tried to 
give him food, but he did not take 
it. His tribe thought that he had 
obtained a magic treasure. At 
night hispeople slept. In the morn- 
ing they came into his house. Theu 
La'liliLax looked at his house. He 
saw the post of his house, and then 
he sang his secret song. He was glad that he had received this house, 
because all had come what the man had told him. This is the secret 
song of La'liliLax:

Then La'liliLax told his tribe to invite all 
the tribes. The speakers went out between 
the legs of the thunder bird,which formed the 
door of the house, and he gave a winter cere- 
monial. He was the thunder dancer. He 
owned the red cedar bark of the thunder 
bird and his name was Ya'qaLEnlis. All 
the tribes who were invited came, and he 
gave away sea-otter blankets, lynx skins, 
bear skins, marten skins, mink skins, and all 
kinds of skins. His clan were the G'e'xsEm 
of the Qoc'xsdt'enox, Then GEdc', chief 
of the Lau'itsis, engaged himself to marry 
La'liliLax's daughter. Her name was A'o-

her. He gave his house and his name to his 
son-in-law, and GEde' invited all the tribes 
when he got the house and name. GEdr'"s 
clan were the Si'sEnLac. Then Ye'qug-alag-ilis, chief of the Q'd'moyue, 
engaged himself to marry the daughter of GEde'. Tlie latter consented, 
and Ye'qug-alag-ilis married the daughter of Gsde', who gave him his

Yr^'qug-alag-ilis invited all the tribes to a feast which he ,i>'ave with what 
he had received from his father-in-law; the coppers, canoes, slaves, boxes, 
covers, and names. Kow Ye'qug-alag'ilis took the name La'liliLax and 
the name for the winter ceremonial that belongs to it. That is the end. 

The following legend belongs to the 
subdivision Me'Emaqaac of the Naqo'- 
mg'ilisala and explains the post shown 
in fig. 3G (see also pp. 332 and 376) : 

Aman livedinahouseatCr'ige'LEm. 
He tried to find the sT'siuL for his mag- 
ical treasure, but he was unsuccessful. 
He only died. Then his tribe put up a 
false grave for him. But he had found 
a magical treasure and went up to 
heaven. Blood was put on his false 
grave, and a sun was painted on it. 
After four days it began to thunder. Le'laxa thundered. He came 
down to the beach early in the morning in the shape of the thunder bird. 
He took ofi' his mask, and they recognized Le'laxa. Then he showed his 
magical treasures; the thunderbird mask, the two-face mask, and the 
morning mask. He wasma/maqa. He threw the worm against his ene- 
mies (see p. 485). He was ts'e'kois' 
and sO'lis.' He had the frog, and 
the ma'maqa who carries spear 
points. He was cannibal and pa'- 
xala. Hewas t'e'nqoa. The thun- 
der-bird mask belongs to the no'n- 
LEm, the other to the winter cer- 
emonial. That is the eud.^ 

The chin r)'a'm.8'amtElaL of the 
Ts'a'watEenox has a number of 
carvings and ornaments, the use of 
which is authorized by the follow- 
ing tradition, which tells of the 
meeting of the ancestor of the clan 
with the deity : 

-c)'a'mtalaL was the name of the 
chief who lived on one side of the 
river Ts'a'wate. X-i'nt'alaqa was 
the name of his wife. B'a'Lalag-i- 
lak-" was his son. iSTau'alagumqa 
and Ts'e'stahs were his daughters. 

x)'a'mtalaL was making a salmon trap. A man came and looked at 
him and his hammer fell into the water. But x)'a'mtalaL just said 
"hoi'p," and the hammer floated. It was (.Ja'niiiilak" who was watching

liim and who made the hammer fall into the water. Twice the hammer 
fell into the water, but when he .said " hoi'p," it floated. Then Qfi/niqilak" 
spoke to xya'mtalaL: "Who are yon?" "I am jr)'a'mtalaL.'' Then 
Qa/niqilak" said merely: "O, friend." Now jr)'a'mtalaL asked in his turn : 
"Who are yon, friend?" and Qa'niqilak" replied, "I am Qa'niqilak", 
friend." ISTan'alagnmqa knew Qri'niqilak"'s thonghts. She went to 
her honse and closed all the chinks and holes. She knew that Qa'ni- 
qilak" was going to make a flood. She and her sister finished closing 
the chinks and holes of the honse. Qa'niqilak" spoke: " Is it true that 
you are a shaman, friend ? " It is said that x^'a'mtalaL's face was almost 
covered by his head ring of red cedar bark. "Give me some of your 
cedar bark, .rj'a'mtalaL,'' said Qa'niqilak". Then -r)'a'ratalaL tore a 
piece of bark from his ring and gave it to Qa'niqilak". Now Qa'niqilak" 
made the tide rise, but Jc)'a'mtalaL merely said "hoi'p," and the water 
ceased rising. Then Qa'niqilak" said: "Truly you can work miracles." 
Now i)'a'mtalaL sent his children home. They left their father. As 
soon as they arrived in their house, our Lord Qa'niqilak" made a flood. 
Then x)*a'mtalaL died. Then B'a'Lalag'ilak" took the place of his father. 
When the tide had gone down, he saw an oulachon in the river. He did 
not know what kind of fish it was. Then he went home with his sis- 
ters. He asked his mother : " What is swimming in the river here? It 
looks like worms." She replied: "Those are oulachons. They are fat. 
Make a trap at the point on the beach where the drift logs are and make 
a string of grass and try to fish." 

Then he went back to the river and saw a canoe coming. It stopped on 
the beach in the same ])lace where B'a'Lalag'ilak" was sitting. We'qae 
was in the canoe. He spoke: "What are you doing at my river?" 
B'a'Lalag-ilak" replied : " Is that your river ? Then tell me what kinds of 
fish go up the river? " We'qac said : "These are the kinds of fish that 
go up my river: Steel head salmon, spring salmon, silver salmon, dog 
salmon, humpback salmon, fronts, that is all." Then B'a'Lalag-ilak" 
rei^lied: "Is that all that goes up the river?" W^e'qae said: "That is 
all." But B'a'Lalag'ilak" added : " Oulachon go up my river." "Qh, I for- 
got that. Let ns go ashore. I want to take that boy into my canoe," said 
We'qae. B'a'Lalag-ilak" asked his sisters to stay where they were. He 
was taken and tied in We'qae's canoe. He made him a slave. Now they 
went down the inlet and came to Dox'ualits'enac. Then B'a'Lalag-ilak" 
moved in the canoe and flew away. In vain they tried to catch him 
with their paddles. He flew home. We'qae traveled on and came to 
(^a'qetEn. There he saw the thunder bird sitting on a rock. 1 le landed 
under the mountain where the tliunder bird was sitting, but he did not 
go out of his canoe. Then the thunder bird sent the wind maker to 
hear what they said. He went down and heard We'qaf' saying: "I 
thought he always made it hail." Then tlie wind maker went back to 
tell the thunder bird what he had heard. Now the thunder bird arose 
and went into his house. He put on his eagle dress and <;ame out again.

VII. The Organization of the Tribe during the Season of 
THE Winter Ceremonial. 

In. the preceding chapter I have described a number of spirits which 
appear to the Indians and are supposed to bestow supernatural i^owers 
upon them. From the legends which I have told, it appears that these 
spirits appeared first to the ancestors of the clan* and I have stated 
that the same spirits continue to appear to the descendants of these 
mythical ancestors. The number of spirits is limited, and the same one 
appeared to ancestors of various clans of different tribes. But in these 
cases he gave each of his proteges his powers in a slightly different 
form. In fact each name of the nobility (as described on p. .338) has a 
separate tradition of the acquisition of supernatural powers, and these 
have descended ujiou the bearers of the name. As indicated in some of 
the traditions, the spirits give ne w n ames to the men to whom they appear, 
but these names are in use only during the time when the spirits dwell 
among the Indians — that is, in winter. Therefore, from the moment 
when the spirits are sni)posed to be present, all the summer names are 
dropped, and the members of the nobility take their winter names. 

It is clear that with the change of name the whole social structure, 
which is based on the names, must break down. Instead of being 
grouped in clans, the Indians are now grouped according to the spirits 
wliich have initiated them. All those who are protected by Baxbaku- 
alanuXsi'wae form one gronp; those who stand under Winfi'lag-ilis 
form another group, etc, and in these groups divisions are made 
according to the ceremonies or dances bestowed upon the person. 

Thus,- at the time of the beginning of the winter ceremonial the 
social system is completely changed. The period when the clan sys- 
tem is in force is called ba'xus, which term also designates those 
who have not been initiated by any spirit, and might be translated 
"profane." The period of the winter ceremonial is called ts'c'ts'aeqa, 
the secrets, which term designates also the ceremonial itself. It is 
also called ts'e/qa (singular of ts'e'ts'aeqa) ; aik*'e/gala (making the 
heart good); and g-a/xaxaak" (brought down from above). The In- 
dians express this alternating of seasons by saying that in summer 
the ba'xus is on top, the ts'e'ts'aeqa below, and vice versa in winter. 

During this period the place of the clans is taken by a number of 
societies, namely, the groups of all those individuals upon whom the 
same or almost the same power or secret has been bestowed by one of 
the spirits. Thus the ha'mats'a, nu'LmaL, bear dancers, etc., form each 
one society, which consists of a limited number of names, because the 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 419 

members of the society derive each their membership from the initia- 
tion of one of the ancestors of the nobility. These ancestors have 
each only one representative at a time. But many of them are grouped 
together, as will be presently described. 

It follows from these facts that a new member of a society can be 
admitted only when another one is dropped, whose place he then takes. 
The custom is analogous to the transfer of a position in the nobility to 
a youth ; the old member transfers his rights to a young man and drops 
out of the ranks of the society. 

The dancers (or societies) are arranged in two principal groups, whose 
names among the Kwakiutl proper are the seals (me'emqoat) and the 
que'qutsa. The former embrace a number of dancers and societies 
of dancers— the ha'matsa, ha'mshamtsEs, k-in(ialaLala, nd'ntsistalaL, 
qoe'qoasElaL, q'o'mindqa, na/nO, iiu'LmaL. They are the highest in 
rank. All the others are que'qutsa. These are subdivided in smaller 
groups according to age and sex, as follows: 

Males. Females. 

1. NaanE'Xsok", boys. 8. Kf'ki'xalak", girls. 

2. Maa'mx'euox (killer whales), young 9. Qaciaqao' (heus), young women. 

jiiejj 10. Mu'smOs (cows), old women. 

3. D'o'd'opa (rock cods), young men, 

about twenty-five years old. 

4. i.'e'L'cxEn (sea lions), older men. 

5. Qoe'qolm (whales), chiefs. 

6. Qo'(iosqimo (Koskimos), old men. 

7. He'mElk (eaters), head chiefs. 

The number of these societies has undergone frequent changes, but 
the Maa'mx'euox, D'o'd'opa, L'e'i.'exEn, and Qoe'qoim have always 
remained. The present societies of the women are quite new, as is 
shown by their names — hens and cows. The former were called until 
about twenty years ago wa'xwaxoli. 

The La'Lasi(ioala are divided in the following way: The group cor- 
responding to the seal group is called q'a'q'anas (a small black shell- 
fish). They embrace the ha'mats'a, ma'maq'a, t'o'x'uit (d'lala), hai'a- 
lik-ilaL, ts'e'koisc, se'lics, ts'e'koa'ta', yiya'LalaL. 

The societies corresponding to the que'qutsa divisions are the 
following : 

Males. Females. 

1. x-i'x-itpa (pufiQns), little boys. 8. Hii'iaxaqEmae (eating first), girls. 

2. Laa'lk'o (mallard ducks), boys. 9. Ts'r-ts'acxsaq (a species of birds), 

3. K-'ik-'ine'La (sea anemones), sick and women. 

lame people. 10. Ba'baLf' (all^atrosses), old women. 

4. G'a'g-imola (halibut hooks), youug 

chiefs. 

5. Ne'ntsae (red cod), third-class chiefs. 

6. L'c'L'axan (sea lions), men about 30 

years old. 

7. Md'omguaua'lc (anchor lines of tribes), 

old chiefs. 



420 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The Xaq'oaqtoq are divided as follows: The group corresponding to 
the seals are called wu'n'awuux'is, the troublesome ones. They em- 
brace hamats'a, bear, aud ma'maq'a. I have not a complete list of the 
subdivisions of the que/qutsa. 

L'o'L'Epana (cormorants) are the chiefs, csElilliLtsawe qoayi'ra (the 
whales for whom one waits), are the young men, ts'e'ts'eg-inaqa (gulls), 
the elder boys. 

The group corresponding to the seal group is called among the 
Koskimo ts'E'qolag-ilis, and embraces wolves and ha/mats'a. The chiefs 
among this tribe are called t'o't'opa (rock-cods), and the higher chiefs 
na'ne (bears). The middle-aged men are called gue'guso (pigs). 

The que'qutsa groups of all these tribes embrace those individuals 
who, for the time being, are not possessed by the spirits. A member 
of tlie que'qutsa may at any time be initiated by a new spirit and then 
he or she leaves their ranks. Or he may become possessed of his 
spirit and show his dance or ceremony. Then he is for the time being 
not considered as one of the que'qutsa, but simply as one of these 
dancers. Therefore the que'qutsa correspond very nearly to the group 
of people who have resigned their places in favor of younger ones, as 
tliese also may reenter the ranks of the nobility by marrying and thus 
obtaining a new name. 

The seal society are subdivided in two groups : The la'xsa (gone into the 
house), those who have gone through the house of BaxbakutllanuXsi'wae 
and learned all his secrets, and the wl'xsa, (not gone into the house), 
those w^ho have only "leaned against its walls." All the dancers who 
are instructed by BaxbakualanuXsi'wae, the ha'mats'a, ha'mshamtsEs, 
BaxbakufdanuXsI'wae's grizzly bear, k-i'uqalaLala and q'o'miuoqa 
belong to the la'xsa; the others are wi'xsa. 

Each dance (le'da) has two names belonging to it — the dance name 
(Ic'laenexLa'ya) and the que'qutsa name (que'tSExLii'ya) which latter 
the individual assumes when giving up his dance in favor of a younger 
man, or which he has when not performing his dance or ceremony. 

The two groups, the seals and the que'qutsa, and the corresponding 
ones among the other tribes, are hostile to one another. The seals 
when excited attack and torment the que'qutsa; the latter, on the other 
hand, tease and torment the members of the seal society. While most 
of the dancers join during the greater part of the ts'e'ts'aeqa season 
the que'qutsa and perform their dances only at certain occasions, the 
members of the seal society, particularly the highest ones, the ha'mats'a, 
nuist stay with their society, and even when they intend to give up 
their dance the que'qutsa try to prevent them by all possible means. 

It will be noticed that most of the subdivisions of the que'qutsa 
have animal names. For this the Indians give the explanation that 
the ceremonial was instituted at the time when men had still the form 
of animals; before the transformer had put everything into its pres- 
ent shape. The present ceremonial is a repetition of the ceremonial 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 



421 



performed by the man animals (uu'xnemis) or, as we may say, a drama- 
tization of the myth. Therefore the people who do not represent spirits, 
represent these animals. 

As might be supposed from the laws governing the clan system, the 
"dance" is principally acquired through marriage. Together with 
the house, the carvings, and names of the father-in-law, the young man 
obtains his dance name and quc'qutsa name, l)ut not for his own use. 
They are given to his successor (Lawu'hianu""'), who is initiated in the 
prescribed way and then performs the ceremony. But the son-in-law 
of the former owner controls the dance. It can be shown only with 
his consent, and, when another man marries his daughter, he may take 
it away from his successor and give it to this person, who then owns 
and controls it. 

By means of marriages with the Awi'k-'enox and He'iltsuq the num- 
ber of dances of the Kwakiutl has been materially increased. 

I can now describe the manner in which these privileges which are 
obtained by marriage are transferred by a man to his son-in-law. I 
stated previously (p. 
359) that according 
to the number of 
children of the couple 
the purchase money 
which was given by 
the young man to his 
father-in-law at the 
time of marriage is 
returned with from 
100 to 300 per cent of 
interest. As the time approaches when this money must be returned, the 
father-in-law calls in all his outstanding debts and gathers all his prop- 
erty, until he has a large stock of food, blankets, boxes, dishes, spoons, 
kettles, bracelets, coppers, and the ceremonial box lids (g-i'sExstala or 
koqetaya'no). These are old lids of boxes, some evidently of very great 
age. Their shape is the same as that of the lids which are still in use, but 
thefront part is much higherand painted with designs representiiigfaces 
and set with sea-otter teeth (fig. 41). The bracelets are tied to sticks, ten 
to each stick ; besides the large coppers, small ones, about an inch or two 
in length, are used. Four of these are tied together and to the end of a 
stick. When the father-in-law has collected the necessary amount of 
property, he is ready for theceremony of the return of the purchase money 
(qaute'x-a). This may be done either in the ba'xus season or during the 
ts'e'ts'aeqa. The ceremonies at both seasons are much alike. I wjll 
describe here the former, as the latter form a part of the winter cere- 
monial. The father-in-law calls his clan together.' They all come, and

at this meeting he inforins the people what auiount of property he is 
going to give to his son-in-Liw, and what names the latter is to receive 
from him; also if he is going to receive his house, his carvings, and 
his dance. The clan offer the father-in-law their help if he should 
not haye enough property. On the following morning the father-in-law 
and the son-in-law each call their clan. The young man assembles his 
people in his house and tells them what he expects his father-in-law to 
give him, and requests the i^eople to dress as nicely as they can.' They 
put on their button blankets and down and paint their faces. They 
remain in front of their house while the father-in-law's people take 
the ceremonial box lids and place them on the beach in the form of 
a square, the sides of which are about 100 feet long. This is called 
the canoe (ma/wa), and all the property that is to be given to the son- 
in-law is placed in this inclosure. From one or two corners of this 
"canoe" cedar bark ropes are stretched to the front corners of the 
young man's house. All the spoons and dishes which the father-in-law 
is going to give away are tied to them. They are called the anchor 
line of the canoe. The father-in-law calls his clan inside the square.^ 
They all carry stafts. One of them sings out "hfi, hu, hfi!" and all 
respond, wfi! This is relocated four times. The clan of the son-in-law, 
who are on the summer seat in front of the house, repeat the cries. 
After this each party sing ten songs in turn. Then the wife of the son- 
iivlaw steps out of the canoe dressed in her best. She wears a blanket 
set with abalone shells. A large abalone shell is fastened to her nose by 
strings which pass over her ears, as the shell is too heavy to be worn 
suspended from the septum. For the same reason her earrings are worn 
susfjended from the hair. She performs a dance, after which her orna- 
ments are given to her husband. 

The mother-in-law is also in the "canoe." It is customary that dur- 
ing the time preceding this festival people of her own and other tribes 
send her small presents of food or help her carry water. In return, 
she gives those who have been kind to her bracelets from out of the 
" canoe." 

Now the speaker of the father-in-law calls the son-in-law, saying: 
"Come, take care of yourself, else you will have bad luck."^ He calls 
four men of his own clan and says to them: "Come! take hold of our 
property that we have in our canoe.""* Then turning again to the son- 
in-law, he continues: "I made an anchor line of spoons.^ I pay you

capital and interest witli these button blankets. This is grease, my 
son-in-law! This is food for your feast. Your name will be (Ma'na- 
kula). When we turn to the ts'e'tsaeqa your name will be (IlO'iLtsa- 
qolis)."^ 

When enumerating' the blankets, grease, and food, the speaker 
does not point at them, but takes up sticks which represent these 
presents. 

Then the speaker takes up a box in which the badges and whistles 
of tlie winter dance are tied up. The box must be hidden under 
the blanket, because it is ba/xus season and nobody must see it. 
He says: "Oome, son-in-law, and take my box."- The young nuin 
takes it and hides it at once under his blanket, saying: "I shall 
hide this. Thank you."^ He carries it to his house at once. Then 
the father-in-law's speaker takes up the copper. If the father-in-law 
has, at the time when he married, given as many as four coppers, he 
will sing out: 



=t 



Ha, ha, La, Ua, lia, liu, hu. 

The speaker holds up the copper and says: "Son-inlaw! IS^ow I 
give you the mast of my canoe (the copper). Its name is (Ma/mo- 
kulelag'a).'' The sou-in-Iaw carries it to his house, and when he conies 
back, the speaker says: "And now I give you boxes from out of my 
canoe." ^ 

After all the presents have been given, the son-in-law and a few of 
his friends go to his house. The rest of his friends go up behind the 
houses and walk secretly up to the end of the village. When they 
have assembled there, they suddenly rush down to the " canoe" and 
with an ax split one of the box covers forming a corner of the canoe. 
While they are doing so the men who went into the house are beating 
time and the members of the secret societies utter their cries, although 
it is ba'xus season. This is called " sinking the canoe" (tsO'kunsa). 
The man who split the box cover says: "Now our loaded canoe is

broken;"' and the son-in-law replies: ''Let us be glad."^ Then be 
sings the following song of joy: 

I will go and tear to pieces Mount Steveus, I will use it for stones for my tire, 

I will go and break Mount Qa'tsta'is, I will use it for stones for my fire; 

Wealth is rolling down to him from the great chiefs, 

Wealth is rolling down to him from all sides; all the chiefs go to him for protection. 

The breaking of the canoe indicates that all the property given to 
the yonng man will be at once distributed among the tribe. This is 
done on the subsequent day. 

There is still another way by which a dance may be obtained — the 
same as the crest and ba/sus (clan) names — namely, by killing its 
owner. It is said that many dances were introduced among the 
Kwakiutl and related tribes in this manner. I will give a few exam- 
ples of this custom, to which I briefly alluded at a former place, but 
whicli I could not treat fully there, because the custom is so intimately 
connected with the winter ceremonials. The first instance about which 
I learned is the following: 

Formerly the Ma/tilpe had no ha'mats'a, but only ha'mshamtsES, 
and the other tribes would not allow them to obtain one through mar- 
riage. At one time a canoe of northern tribes passed near the village 
of the Ma'tilpe. Two young men observed it, and they saw that there 
were four men and two women in the canoe, one of whom wore the 
badges of the ha/mats'a. Then the two Ma'tilpe youths determined to 
kill the ha'mats'a in order to obtain his dance. They paddled up to the 
strangers, who asked the two young men to direct them to a campiug 
place. They did so. Then they hid their guns in the bushes near 
by, and told the strangers that they were on their way to look after 
their traps. They asked for the loan of the strangers' guns. When they 
had received them, they went to the place where they had hidden their 
own weapons, loaded them and shot the four men and the two women. 
One of the youths took the cedar bark ornaments of the ha'mats'a. 
He found his whistles in a bag. At once he began to utter the 
ha'mats'a's cry "hai^, hap," for now he had the right to use the dance 
owned by the man whom he had killed. He also took two coppers 
which he found in the canoe. This method of obtaining a dance and 
other objects is called kue'xanEm, obtained by killing. 

It is the same when a novice who is being initiated is found in the 
woods — the person who finds him may kill him. The murderer then 
obtains his dance, and the relatives of the novice are not allowed to 
take revenge.

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 425 

The following" very cliaracteristic descriptioihs were given to Mr. 
George Hunt in the summer of 1895. He tells them as follows : 

I was walking on the street of the Nimkish village when I saw 
He'x'hak'En, who was sitting on his summer seat. He called me and 
said: "O, my dear! Your days, young men, are good. But our past 
ways'^^"ere evil when we were all at w^ar against each other. I mean 
you have no troul)le nowadays. I was three times pursued by north- 
ern Indians at the time when we were still naked." Then I asked 
He'x'hak'En, "Where did this happen"?" And he said, "At Ga'wide. 
We were in two canoes harpooning porpoises. I was in the one, my 
friend, NEmoXtsaXqo'lag-ilis, was in the other one. I had killed two 
porpoises. When it got day, I saw four canoes, and I told my friend. 
He said to me: 'I will go to the island Ga/wide'; and I said, 'I will 
go to O'gwamalis. Take good care of yourself. Good bye.' Then I 
paddled away. My canoe was flying like a bird. Two of the canoes 
pursued me, but they could not overtake me. Then I looked back and 
I saw that they could not catch up with my friend, who had nearly 
arrived at Ga'wide. Then I watched them and I saw how the warriors 
were looking for my friend. It grew night and I felt badly, for I saw 
that the warriors had a fire on the beach. I asked my steersman : 
'What do you think? Sliall we look after my friend and see if they 
have enslaved him!' He agreed, and we paddled to the island. When 
we arrived there, I took my gun and went ashore. I went to where the 
fire was burning on the beach and saw that the w^arriors had unloaded 
their canoes. I said to my companion: 'Take care, my dear, I am 
going to shoot them.' We hauled up our canoe and hid. As soon as 
we reached there, we sat down close to them. They were eating. 
There were five men in line from my seat and my friend said that there 
were three in line from his seat. We put thirty balls of buckshot 
each in our guns and fired both at the same time. I had killed three 
and wounded the two others. My friend had killed two and wounded 
the third man. And I saw two more men running away. Then we 
ran to the wounded ones and killed them. One man and four women 
we took alive and made them our slaves. We took the property of the 
northern people. I looked into a large box, and when I opened it I saw 
much red cedar bark and abalone shells which were attached to it, and 
whistles of a ha'mats'a. I asked one of the women: 'What is that in 
this box?' She only replied: 'Horn, horn, hum, hom, hdm, ham, ham, 
ham, hn, hu,' and she bit her own arm. Then I knew that one of these 
men whom we shot had been a ha/mats'a. I cried ha,p right away. 
There were also two coppers in the bottom of that box. Then we came 
here to Alert Bay in the canoe of the dead men. Here we were met by 
our tribe, the Nimkish. We were invited at once by Chief Koax'ila- 
no'kumO, together with our slaves. He gave us dried halibut to eat. 
As soon as we had eaten, the chief spoke and said: 'My dear, tell us 
where did you get these women?' Then I spoke to him and told what 



426 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

had happened. But first I asked: 'Has my friend NEmoXtsaXqo'- 
lag'ilis come yet? He was pursued by these northern people and some 
others whom I killed, toward Gfi'wide. Then I saw these people land- 
ing and thought they might have caught my friend. We went to 
Lasig-alis and watched them. We saw them making a fire on the 
beach. As soon as it was night I went to Ga'wide, because I was 
troubled on account of my friend Avho was on tlie island. Then we 
paddled to the east side of Ga/wide, for the northern people were stay- 
ing on the north side. I went ashore and secretly went up to where 
they were staying. They were just getting ready to eat. Then I went 
back to my canoe and told ray companion that they were just getting 
ready to eat. I said : ' What do you think f Let us kill them. Let us 
have our own way with them and shoot them from a distance. I do 
not see any danger in it.' He agreed. Then we shot many of them. 
I have done well.' Thus I spoke to the Nimkish. And I said: ' Now, 
there is some more red cedar bark for us; this box is full of varions 
kinds.' I took up the coppers and said : ' I obtained these two coppers. 
The name of the one shall be Kue'xanEm (obtained by killing), and that 
of the other Xa'lgEmala (day on its face).' Then L'umx-ilag-ilis arose 
and spoke: 'Thank you, cousin ! Xow yon obtained by killing this red 
cedar bark and what is in this box. Xow take care, Chief ! You must 
show it in the coming winter ceremonial. Now you know what we 
have done. You may tell it when a person asks where we obtained 
these dances. Now let all the profane go out of the house that you 
may see the red cedar bark, else you might say that I invented it. 
Now you shall know it, chiefs of the Nimkish, and you, young men of 
the Nimkish.' 

"Then La'gesawa spoke: 'Truly now 1 believe that our chief has 
done well. Now you, young men, go out of the house ! Only our chiefs 
shall stay here.' Then all the men went out and only six chiefs stayed 
in the house. Then we bolted the door of my house and I opened the 
box. I put around my neck the ring of red cedar bark and I put the 
headring on my head. Then I took the whistles and showed them to all 
the chiefs and I cried ' hap ' as the ha'mats'a cries now-a-days. I spoke : 
'Now look at me, Nimkish chiefs. This cedar bark ornament I obtained 
by killing its owner. Therefore you must not say anything against 
me. Examine it closely, else you will say later on when I give my 
winter dance that I invented it.' Then L'a/qoLas said: 'Chief, what 
can we say against you since you killed these men ? You have obtained 
this ornament from the man whom you have killed, therefore it is called 
obtained by killing. It is the same as though you had obtained your 
ha'mats'a through marriage. Now go on and give a winter dance. 
Why should we not do it in the right way?' Then my brother's son 
disai)peared right away, and when he came back in winter he was my 
ha'mats'a. That is what I did in the past. Now you know it.'* 

It is stated by the testimony of all the older Indians that the whole

hfi'mats'a cereinouial was obtained in this uianuer by killing a great 
number of Ilr-'iltsuci. The war in which this happened is one of the 
most famous oues in the history of these tribes. I give here a version 
obtained by Mr. Hunt. 

The Bi'lxula made war upon the Qoe/xsot'enox. It was autumn. 
They landed above the village Qoa'yastEm and hauled their canoes 
ashore. Late in the evening they sent spies out to examine the village. 
About midnight, when all the Qoe/xsot'enox were asleep, the Bi'lxula 
huinched their canoes and divided. One-half went to the east end of the 
village, and one-half to the west end. They stayed in their canoes not 
far from the beach until it was almost daylight. It was foggy. As 
soon as it grew daylight they landed and many men went to the rear 
of the houses. As soon as they were ready the most courageous war- 
riors broke into the doors of the houses and speared men, women, and 
children Whoever tried to escape through the rear door was speared 
by the men stationed there. Others of the Bi'lxula looked after the 
valuable property and put it into their canoes. Now the Qoe'xsot'enox 
were all killed. Only seven men and five women were left. Then the 
Bi'lxula set fire to the houses. Their canoes were deeply loaded with 
men's heads. They went home. At that time people of different tribes 
had stayed at Qoa'yastEm; Ma'maleleqala, Lau'itsis, Nimkish, and 
Na'cioaqtoq, all guests of the Qoe'xsot'enox. They were all slam by 
the Bi'lxula and also some who belonged to the Kwakiutl. Then 
four men came and told what had happened to KEqa'p'Euk-Em, chief ot 
the Kwakiutl, who was Qoe'xsot'enox by his father's side. Then he 
called the Kwakiutl and asked them to go to war against the Bi'lxula. 
Then four men were sent to ask the Ma'maleleqala, ^^imkish, and Lau'- 
itsis to go to war also. And they also asked the La'Lasiqoala and the 
Na/qoaqtoq. Four very strong men were selected, and after six days 
they came back again. When they came back to Tsaxis, NEqa'p'- 
Euk-Ein invited them and when they were seated in his house, he called 
all the Kwakiutl to hear the reports of the messengers. When the 
people had come, he asked them to be silent and to listen to the words 
of the messengers. One of them said: " In four days they will all be 
ready to come, men and women. All decided to go to war against the 
Bi'lxula." Then Ya'xLEii said: " Now go, Kwakiutl! Prepare to go, 
that we may not stay another night when they come. And let our 
wives wash for four days that we may have good luck. Alter they had 
eaten, the men who were going to war took seaweed and blew into it 
until it nearly burst. Then they made neck rings out of it. When they 
had done so, NEqa'p'Enk-Em invited all the men and women to his house. 
He told them what to do, for he knew all the customs of ancient times. 
He snoke: "Thank you, Kwakiutl, thank you and your beloved wives. 
Now kwakiutl, we will soar up and catch in our talons the Bi'lxula. We 
will be the great thunderbird. We will revenge our fathers, our 
mothers, our uncles, our aunts, our sisters, and our younger brothers, 



428 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

and also the chiefs, our grandfathers, Ya'qaLanlists'e and LEk*amaxor 
Therefore, I call you to make war upon the Bi'lxula, for they have our 
names and our red cedar bark. Now, take great care, else we shall not 
get back our dancing masks. Now we will go and take back the names 
of our dancing nuisks. For these we will fight against the Bi'lxula. 
Now go tomorrow morning and rub your bodies with hemlock branches. 
You men go altogether to one place. And you women go to another 
place and rub yourselves also with hemlock branches, for we shall meet 
later on as though we were fighting. Do not laugh, you women, but 
carry your kelp in which the breath of your husbands is enclosed. 
Throw it at your husbands, and when Ave finish, go into the water. 
When a kelp tube bursts, its owner nuist not accompany us, for he 
would never return." 

Then YeqaLalasamc arose and spoke: " My tribe, I am glad on 
account of your si)eech. I heard it said that we are going to war. 
What tribe are we going to make war uponf" He pretended not to 
know. Then Ya'xLEu replied : " Chief, we are going to make war upon 
the Bi'lxula." Then the great warrior uttered the ha'niats'a cry and 
said: " That was my desire, for that is the only tribe in whose blood 1 
did nut dip my hands. Thank you, Kwakiutl, but take care! You 
must arise in the morning before the crow cries. Do not wear blankets, 
but you women wear the kelp rings. That is all I want to tell you." 
Then the men left the house and went to sleep. On the next morning 
the great warrior YcqaLalasame himself awakened them before the 
crows were stirring. Then all the men and women arose. Only those 
who were menstruating were not allowed to go. First the men went to 
get hemlock branches, then the women did the same. Then they all 
went into the sea and sat down crying, " hfi, hn, hu " They rubbed their 
bodies with hemlock branches. When they came out of the water, their 
bodies were all red. They wiped themselves and then men and women 
met. Now the ha/mats'a, bear dancers and nu'LmaL, and all the other 
dancers, became excited. The women did the same, and then men and 
women pretended to fight. The women threw the kelp rings at their 
husbands, who tried to catch them. When a man missed his kelp ring 
or when it burst, he was not allowed to go on the war expedition. For 
four days the men and women continued to do this. When they had 
finished, they prepared their weapons. After five days the Ma'malele- 
qala arrived in four canoes, the Nimkish in six canoes, the Lau'ltsis in 
two canoes, the Ts'a'watEcnox in eight canoes. Then NEqa'p'Euk-Em 
invited all the tribes. When they were in his house, he gave them 
dried salmon and afterwards clover root, liefore they finished this 
course Neqa'p'Euk-Em arose and said: "Fathers, uncles, brothers, 
children, thank you that you have come. Now let us go and look for our 
exterminated tribe, the Qoe'xsot'cnox, who were eaten by the Bi'lxula. 
Let us make them vomit our tribe." And all repeated his words and 
said: "You have said it. We Avill do it." But NEqa'p'Enk'Em did not 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 429 

stop speaking. He continued: '^Therefore I called you to make war 
upon the Bi'lxula. My tribe, the Kwakiutl, have eight canoes; the 
Q'o'moyue have four canoes; the \Yillas Kwakiutl have two canoes; 
the Q'o'mk'fitis two canoes. We have sixteen canoes. Nobody whom 
we meet hereafter shall live. That is all." Then Ma'Xua, chief of the 
Ma'maleleqala arose and spoke: "You are good, you are great, Kwa- 
kiutl. What is it you are saying? Do you say we intend to go to 
war?" NEqu'p'Enk'Em replied: "Yes; we will go to war." Then 
Ma'Xua said: "Thank you, friend. Thank you, Kwakiutl. Look at 
the tears on my face which I wept for the Qoe'xsot'enox, for our lost 
names. Xow take care, warriors of the Ma/maleleqala, and you Nim- 
kish, Lau'itsis, Maa'mtag-ila, and Ts'a'watEenox, else we shall not get 
any heads. Let us start early in the morning. And I will be your 
guide, for my ancestor was the killer whale. Therefore I am not afraid 
of anything, neither of war nor of distributing property." Then they 
left the house. 

Early the following morning they started. W^hen all the tribes had 
come to the island opposite Gua'ts'e, NEqa'p'Enk-Em and Ye'qaLala- 
same arose and the former spoke, "Friends, now our season will change 
from ba'xus to ts'c'ts'aeqa as soou as we cut oft" the head of a man. 
Then our ha'mats'a, bears and nuLmaL, the liawi'nalaL, and all the 
other winter dancers, will become excited. Now let spies go ahead in 
four canoes. ISTow we are no longer men, we are killer whales. When 
you see a canoe, fire a gun that we may know it. Then take hold 
of the canoe, but do not hurt them until we come." NEqil/p'Euk-Em 
finished speaking and sat down. Then one canoe of the Kwakiutl, one 
of the Ma'maleleqala, one of the Mmkish, and one of the Lau'itsis went 
ahead. They steered to G-i'lsg-iltEm. When they had passed the 
island, the other war canoes followed. At night they stopped at 
Nux'saqolL. Early the next morning YeqaLalasame sneezed. Then 
he awakened all the men and said, " Slaves! I sneezed with my right 
nostril. To-day we shall stain our hands in blood." Then the four 
spies started again. They did not see canoe nor smoke and all the 
warriors became sorry. Now they arrived at the mouth of Eivers Ldet. 
Then MaXua, chief of the Ma'maleleqala spoke, " Listen to me, friends. 
My heart feels badly, because we have not yet seen anyone whom we 
might slay. Let us play with the Awl'k-'enox, the tribe of this place, 
to gladden my heart." The warriors did not want to do it, and while 
they were still talking the report of two guns was heard. "Now, 
slaves, paddle. Those w^ere our spies." Then all the men paddled on. 
The Kwakiutl came to a place where six canoes of Hc'iltsuq were lying 
and the four canoes of their spies. The Nimkish were the next to 
arrive. Then came the Lau'itsis, and far behind the others the Ma'ma- 
irdeqala. The TlG'iltsuq were telling about their voyage and also that 
the Bi'lxula had barricaded their houses. Then Y'r-'qaLalasamr' said, 
" Friends, ask the He'iltsuq who is their chief." Then Kalam asked 



430 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

for tlie chief of the He'iltsuq. Que man by the name of Yeimats'alis 
replied, "All these men are chiefs of the O'yala itx. That is the (3iistom 
of the He'iltsuq when they distribute blankets, all their chiefs go 
inviting. Now I will give you the names : This is 0'mx''it, this Wa'k-as, 
this Ila'mts'it, this GoxsEmiia'kula, this La'qoag-ila, Wa'waxamis, 
Do'koaya-isahi, Ha"masilak", Ya'kaL'Eiiala, Hanfi/yus, Quina, (iue'l- 
tok", Ga'ide, Lfi'Lilila, and Kala'guynwis; they are all chiefs.'' Then 
La/LaLnnam spoke ; "How do you feel now ? You said before you would 
not have mercy even on your relatives. Now here are all the chiefs 
of the He'iltsuq." Then O'mx-'it untied the cover of his box and took 
out his whistles. He gave them to his son Wa'k-as, and O'mx-'it him- 
self took the Lao'laxa' horn and blew it four times, and Wa'k-as blew 
the ha'mats'a whistles. Then Ya'xLEu arose and said, "Don't let the 
voice of the ts'etsaeqa sound too loud. You heard it. We cannot 
hurt the red cedar bark that sounded before all of you. Let us meet 
them with our ts'e'tsaeqa at the danciug season. We will rival with 
tlie dances of our brother O'ts'e'stalis, 0'mx''it, Wa'k-as, and Quina. 
We cannot kill the He'iltsuq. Let us go to war against the Bi'lxula." 
He was just speaking so when the Ma'maleleqala came in sight arouud 
the point of the bay. They saw the canoes drifting, and MaXua arose 
at once and said: "Why do you let your canoes drift about?" And 
Ya'yaqadalaL took up his lance and killed the steersman of one of the 
He'iltsuq eauoes. As soon as he had done so he cried, "hup, hup, hup." 
Then all the tribes attacked the He'iltsuq. Only O'mx-'it was not killed. 
As soon as the lia'mats'a killed a man he cried, "hap, hap, hap," the 
bear growled, and every dancer became excited as soon as he killed a 
man. When all the He'iltsuq were dead, they took their freight and 
divided it. But the red cedar bark and the whistles of the ha'mats'a 
and of the Lao'laxa were given to the war chiefs. All the chiefs of the 
He'iltsuq were ha'mats'a. Now, O'mx-'it was a slave of Ma'Xua, the 
chief of the Ma'maleleqala. Then NEqa'p'Euk-Emsaid: "Friends, what 
do you think'? Shall we go on to the Bi'lxula'? Think of it, friends! 
We have done a great thing. The chiefs O'ts'e'stalis, Ba'salaL, 
Wixwaqoqamaya, and Wii'yats'uLa have not come here. They are 
near relations of those whom we killed. Are you not afraid of them ? 
Then there are all the sons of O'ts'e'stalis. I think we ought to go 
home." Then they all returned. They had obtained all the names and 
all the dances of the dead chiefs of the He'iltsuq. Since that time the 
tribes have the cedar bark ornaments of the He'iltsuq and their names. 
They obtained them by spilling the blood of these men in war.^ 

I have given these reports in some detail, as aside of the light they 
throw upon the acquisition of names and dances by war, they show

also that tbe societies are recognized on war expeditions. 1 shall 
revert to this subject later on. 

Notwithstanding the fact that each and every dance must be obtained 
by means of a marriage or by killing its owner, there are a number of 
offices connected with the ceremonials of the societies which are strictly 
hereditary in the male line and remain, therefore, always m the same 
clan. To this class belongs the office of the master of ceremonies, the 
officer who has charge of the drum, of the batons, of the eagle down, 
and others which will be set forth in the description of the ceremonial 
(Chapter IX). This is another argument in favor of the theory expressed 
above that the institutions of the Kwakiutl were at one time paternal, 
but were later on modified by the influence of the northern tribes, who 
are on a maternal stage. 

VIII. The Dances and Songs of the Winter Ceremonial. 

The object of the whole winter ceremonial is, first, to bring back the 
youth who is supposed to stay with the supernatural being who is 
the protector of his society, and then, when he has returned in a state 




Figs. 42 and 43.

of ecstasy, to exorcise the spirit which possesses him and to restore 
him from his holy madness. 

These objects are attained by songs and by dances. In order to 
bring the youth back, members of all the secret societies perforin their 
dances. It is believed that they will attract the attention of the absent 
novice, until finally one of the dances may excite him to such a degree 
that he will approach flying through the air. As soon as he appears 
his friends endeavor to capture him. Then begins the second part of 
the ceremony, the exorcising of the spirit; or, as the Kwakiutl call it, 
the taming of the novice. This is accomplished by means of songs 
sung in his honor, by dances performed by women in his honor, and by 
the endeavors of the shaman. After the novice has thus been restored 
to his senses, he must undergo a ceremonial purification before he is 
allowed to take part in the ordinary pursuits of life. The strictness 
and severity of this purification depend upon the character of the 
dance. Novices must drink water through the wing bone of an eagle, 
as their mouths must not touch the brim of the cup; they must suck 



432 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



no more and no less than four times. They must not blow liot food, 
else they would lose their teeth. 

The songs mostly consist of four verses. Each novice, viz, member 
of a society, has his own songs. They open with a burden which 
varies according to the society to which they belong. Tliis burden is

sung in order to indicate the tune. Then follow the words, which, 
however, are interspersed with repetitious of the burden. The words 
are called "the walk of the song" (or, as we should say, the words go 
this way). Each, song is accompanied by beating of time with batons, 
and by a drum. The beating is sometimes so loud that it almost

drowns the song. The rhythm of the tune, as well as of the beating, 
is exceedingly complex; but the most striking characteristic is the fact 
that the beating is always syncopated. The arm is raised when the 
tone is uttered and falls quickly afterwards. In all songs of the win- 
ter ceremonial the beating begins several bars before the singing. It

is the reverse in profane songs. The beating is an intrinsic part of 
the songs and can not be separated from it. 

The dances of the various societies differ in cliaracter, and will be 
described in the course of this chapter. They have all this in common, 
that the dancer on entering the door turns once to the left at a place 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS.

between tlie door and the fire. Then he dances toward the right, leav- 
ing the fire at his left. In the rear of the fire he turns again to the 
left, and after liaviug made a complete turn continues his course. 
Every time he reaches the front or the rear of the fire, he makes a turn 
and then continues his way in tlie same direction. Each dance con- 
sists of four circuits around the fire. The motions of the feet follow 
the rhythm of the beating, not of the song. 

When a mistake is made in these songs or dances which are intended

to pacify the novice, the effect is not only a renewed ecstasy of the 
novice, but it also excites all the older members of the various societies 
and thus produces a general ecstasy. 

Errors in rhythm, turning the wrong way in a dance, smiling, and 
chewing gum are counted as mistakes. The error must be atoned for by 
an initiation of the person who made the mistake. When the members 
of the seal society observe a mistake, they jump from their seats and bite 
and scratch the person who made the mistake. He drops down at once

and pretends to faint, and while the excited dancers surround him he 
disappears. This means that a spirit has taken him away in order to 
initiate him. The members of the seal society sit on the platform of 
the house or stand during the dances, that they may be certain to dis 
cover mistakes. The seal society attack and maltreat throughout the 
ceremonial the que'qutsa. At the close of the winter ceremonial they 
must pay an indemnity for all the damage that they may have done. 
No greater misfortune, however, can happen than for one of the 
NAT MU.s 95 28

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



dancers wlio pcrfonus his eeremoiiial dance to fall. In the course of 
the winter ceremonial quite a hole gradually develops at the two places 
where the dancers turn, and it is here that they are most likely to 

stumble and fall. 

When a ha'mats'a falls in his dance, he 
must lie down as though he was dead. 
Then the master of ceremonies calls a man 
whose name is E'k'istolis (sand in eyes, 
i. e., a drowned person), whose office is 
hereditary. He is a que'qutsa, and as an 
ofticer he is called ts'a'ts'exsilacnox (doing 
secretly). He carries a large staft' 
(k-'e'lag*aiu), which is split like a 
pair of tongs, and in the interior 
of which some blood is hidden. 
With this staff he takes hold of 
the neck of the ha'mats'a and ap- 
parently blood is seen to flow from 
it. Then all the he'lig-a (see j). 
438) lift the ha'mats'a, put him on 
their mat, and carry him 
four times around the 
fire. After they have 
gone around the fire 
four times his whistle 
is heard in the woods. 
AMien the mat is put 
down, it is seen that he 
has disappeared and 
that only his blankets 
and ornaments are left 
behind. 
He stays away for four days and his father must 
make a new festival for him. When the ha/mats'a 
falls, everybody puts his hand over his eyes and 
drops his head, crying ha.' As the expense of such 
a festival is very great, the amount equaling the 
return of the marriage money, but few persons are 
able to afford a second initiation. While nowadays 
every effort is made to enable the ha'mats'a's father 
to give the new festival, it is said that in former times the unfortu- 
nate one was killed by the other ha'mats'a, the bear dancers, and The 
nfi'LmaL, often at the instance of his own father. 

When a ha'mats'a falls in his dance, it is considered an evil omen, 
indicating that he will die at an early date.

The view taken by the Kwakiutl is evidently that the falling of a 

ha'mats'a or of another dancer is an indication of either ill will on the 

part of the spirit, or as a defeat of their spirit by that of another tribe. 

Thus I was told that at one time the Kwakiutl had invited the 
Ma'malr'leqala for a winter ceremonial. When 
one of their dancers fell, their own nu'LmaL 
tried to kill him, and he was rescued with dif- 

liculty by the que'- 
qutsa. The song which 
was nsed during his 
dance was never used 
again. They believed 
that the event was 
proof that the spirit 
presiding over the 
winter ceremonial of 
the Ma'maleleqala 
was stronger than 
their own. 
When one of the dancers of an inferior society falls, he disappears 

also to be initiated, but his father does not need to go to the exjiense 

of a complete festival, as these initiations are much less expensive. 
The i^araphernalia of the dances consist largely of ornaments made 

of cedar bark, which is dyed in the Juice of 

alder bark ; of masks, whistles, and carvings of 

various kinds. All of these must not be seen 

by the profane. If any of these happened to see 

them, they were killed without mercy. As an ex- 
ample of this, I was told the following incident: 
One of the que'qutsa was prei^aring a carving 

to represent the si'siuL. His daughter happened 

to see him at work. Then he called her into his 

room and dug a hole right under the fireplace. 

He asked her to put her head into his lap, i^re- 

tending that he wanted to louse her. Then he 

killed her with a hammer. He put her body 

info the hole, covered it, and replaced the ashes. 

His wife looked for the girl, but he did not tell 

her of what he had done until the following 

summer, Avhen he fell sick. Then he asked his 

wife to bury the remains of their daughter. As 

a survival of this custom, the saying remains which is used by the 

initiated in warning away the profane: -'Go away, else we shall bury 

you." ' 

By far the greater portion of the winter ceremonial is performed in

ii house set apart for this purpose. It is called lo'pEk" (emptied) 
because it is emptied of everythiug that is profane. Only when 
dauces are performed, are the iminitiated or the profane allowed to 
enter the house. They must stay at the left-hand side of the entrance. 
Most of the dances are performed in connection with feasts. Others 
are shown in connection with distributions of property. As during 
the ceremonial the clans are suspended, the order of seats which pre- 
vails in summer is also suspended, and a new 
arrangement takes place. The seal society 
have the seats of honor in the rear of the 
house, and among them the highest ha'mats'a 
has the lirst seat, in the middle of the rear 
of the house. At both sides of the ha'mats'a 
society sit the bear dancers and other mem- 
bers of the seal society. At the extreme 
ends of this society sit the uu'LmaL, the mes- 
sengers of the ha'mats'a. The killer whale 
and rock cod societies sit in front of the seal 
society. They are tlie singers. 

The hc'mElk and the whale society sit next 
to the nu'LmaL — the former to the left of the 
ha'mats'a, the others to his right. The Kos- 
kimo sit next to them near the front corners 
of the house. The women sit all along the 
sides of the house in the rear row, the 
chicken society farthest in the rear, the dam 
society and the Ke'ki'xalak" in front. The 
person who gives the feast and all his rela- 
tives are in the " kettle corner/' the right- 
hand front corner of the house. The profane 
sit on the left-hand side of the door. When 
one tribe has invited another one, all the 
members of the invited tribe sit in tlie front 
part of the sides of the house. The seal 
society of the hosts sit in the rear, and their 
singers as described heretofore. The rest of 
the inviting tribe are in the kettle corner. 
Sometimes at such occasions all the mem- 
bers of the seal society and of the corresponding societies of the other 
tribes sit in the rear of the house. Then the ha'mats'a of all the tribes 
sit in the middle — first those of the Kwakintl, at each side those of the 
Ma'maleleqala, at their sides those of the Mmkish and Lau'itsis. The 
other groups arrange themselves in the same manner, the Kwakintl 
members sitting in the rear row nearest the rear of the housej then 
toward the door follow the Ma'maleleqala, continuing in the next 
row nearer the fire. Then follow the Nimkish and Lau'itsis.

The singers sit so arranged tliat the rear rows are facing the fire while 

the frout rows face backward. In their midst sits the song leader 

(na'qate) and his two assistants (gua'nuLEme=sitting at his sides). It 

is the duty of the song leader to make new songs, to compose new words 

to old tunes, to learn quickly the 

songs of the returning novice, 

and to teach them to the singers. 

He also gives signals for changes 

in rhythm and starts the tunes. 

His oflice is hereditary in the 

male line. His assistants call out 

the words for each verse. The 

singers are so seated that in front 

of the board which serves for their 

back support they can spread 

their mats, and, when kneeling 

on these, have in easy reach long 

planks on which they beat the 

rhythm with batons. These are 

generally of split pine wood and 

are made at the time of opening 

the feast. They are about li feet long, and the singers before using 

them roughly smooth one end, which is used as a handle. They either 

beat downward, holding the baton in their hands stretched forward, 

or they hold it like a pestle and thump the plank with it. In former 

times when wood was not easily split on account of lack of steel axes, 

they kept the batons, which were in conse 
quence also more nicely finished. Nowadays 
only the song leader and his assistants have 
carved or painted batons. (Figs. 42-50.) 
The ordinary crude batons are generally 
split up at the end of the festival and used as 
torches for lighting the way home through 
the darkness of the street. It is a very pretty 
sight to see the numerous guests going home, 
each carrying his torch and lighting up the 
logs and canoes on the beach on the one side 
and the dark row of houses on the other. 
I will now proceed to describe the ceremo- 
nials of various societies. 

BaxbakurilanuXsi'wae,as stated above, in- 
itiates several dancers, the most important of 
which is the ha/mats'a, or the cannibal. He 

is possessed of the violent desire of eating men. The novice is taken 

away by this spirit and is supposed to stay at his house for a long time. 

The ])eriod of his absence extends over three or four months, during 

which time he actually stays in the woods. In the middle of this time

swinging rattles, tiie sound of whicli is supposed to pacify tlie na'mats'a. 
This ofitice is hereditary in the male line, and either four or six of them 
must accompany the ha'mats'a whenever he is in an ecstasy. They sur- 
round him in a close circle in order to prevent him from attacking the 
l)eoj)le and utter the pacifying cries "hoi'p, hoi'p." The rattles of the 
hr'lig-a are always carved witli a design which originally represented a 
skull. Figures 51 and 52 show this design clearly, but it often degen- 
erates into the representation of a conventional face, and in some cases 
it has simply a rounded shape, and an animal is carved on its face. 
(Figs. 53-59.) I do not know if the beautiful rattles which are used by 
the he'lig'a of the Kwakiutl, but which were made by the lle/iltsuci and 
represent the thunder bird on a round rattle (fig. 60), had originally a 
diHerent meaning. In olden times, when the ha'mats'a was in a state of 
ecstasy, slaves were killed for him, whom he devoured. The following 
facts were observed by 
Mr. Hunt and Mr. Moffat 
in the early days of 
Fort Eupert: When a 
hil'mats'a had returned 
from the woods, a slave, 
a man of the Nanaimo 
tribe, named Xu'ntEm, 
was shot. They saw 
him running down to 
the beach, where he 
dropi^ed. Then all the 
ufi'LmaL of the Kue/xa 
tribe went down to the 
beach carrying knives 
and lances. The bear 
dancers and the ha'- 
mats'as followed them. 
The nfi'LuuiL cut the 
body with their knives and lances and the ha'mats'as squatted down 
dancing and crying "hap, haj)." Then the bear dancers took up the 
flesh and, holding it like bears and growling at the same time, they 
gave it to the highest ha'mats'a first and then to the others.' In mem- 
ory of this event a face representing BaxbakualannXsT'wae was carved 
in the rock on the beach at the place where the slave had been eaten. 
The carving is done in sandstone, which was battered down with stone

' Mr. George Hunt, who told me this story as reported to him by hia father, who had 
been au eyewitness, added the following remark.s, which are of interest as elucidat- 
ing some of the views of these tribes. The slave's wife was at that time in the fort. 
She went ont on the gallery and called out to the hfi'mats'a: "I will give you five 
years to live. The spirit of yonr winter dance ceremonial is strong, but mine is 
stronger. You killed my husband with gun and bullet, and now I will kill you with 
the point of my tongue."' After five years all those who had taken part in the nnirder 
were dead.

hammers (f'late 23). Near this rock carving there are a number of 

others and much older ones (Plates 24-2(5, fig. (51). The Indians have 

no recollection of tlie incidents 
which they are to commemorate. 
They say tliat tliey were made 
at the time before animals were 
transformed into men. 

I received another report of the 
killing of a slave. A female slave 
was asked to dance for the ha'- 
mats'a. Before she began dan- 
cing she said : "Do not get hungry, 
do not eat me."' She had hardly 
said so when her master, who was 
standing behind her, split her 
skull with an ax. She was eaten 
by the ha'mats'a. This happened 
in Xewettee, and Q'omEna'kula, 
who participated in the perform- 
ance, was living until a couple of 
years ago. He told me that it 
is exceedingly hard to eat fresh 
human flesh, much more so than 
to eat dried 
c o r 1) s o s . 
The bones 
of the killed 

slaves were kept at the north side of the 

house, where the sun does not shine upon them. 

During the fourth night they were taken out of the 

house, tied up, weighted with a stoue, and thrown 

into deep water, because it is believed 

that if they were buried they would 

come back and take their master's soul. 
When the ha/mats'a had bitten a j)iece 

out of the arm of one of his enemies, he 

drank hot water after having swallowed 

the flesh. It was believed that this would 

result in the inflammation of the wound. 

Nowadays, when the ceremonies have 

lost much of their former cruelty, they do 

not actually bite the piece of flesh out of 

the arm, but merely pull the skin u^) with 

their teeth, sucking hard so as to remove 

as nuich blood as possible, and then with a small sliarp knife cut off 

secretly a piece of skin. This is not swallowed, but hidden behind

tlie ear uutil after the dance, wbeii it is returned to the owner, in order 
to assure him that it will not be used against him for purposes of 
witchcraft. 

Besides devouring- slaves, theha'mats'as also devour corpses. When 
a new ha/mats'a, after being initiated, returns from the woods he will 
sometimes carry a corpse, which is eaten after his dance. The bodies 
are prepared for this ceremony. The skin is cut around the wrists and 
ankles, as they must not eat the hands and feet. It is believed that 
else they would die immediately. The ha/mats'a nuist use for this cere- 
mony the corpse of one of his deceased relatives, which the he'lig'a 
must prepare. The Kwakiutl used to bury their dead on trees. The 
body was placed in a box, and these 
boxes were placed on branches a 
considerable distance up a tree. 
There the boxes were })iled one on 
top of the other (Plate 27). The 
bodies, when so exposed to the ac- 
tion of the freely circulating air, 
mostly mummify. A corj^se is taken 
down from the tree and is soaked in 
salt water. The he'lig-a takes hem- 
h)ck twigs, the leaves of which have 
been removed, and pushes them un- 
der the skin, gradually removing all 
the decayed flesh until nothing 
but the skin remains. After this is 
done the body is placed on top of 
the small hut in which the novice 
(g-i'yakila) is living while he is 
staying in the woods. The hands 
of the body hang down. Its belly 
is cut open and spread with sticks. 
The ha'mats'a keeps a fire under it 
and smokes it. Four days before 
he returns to the village he sends for all the old ha'mats'as. When 
they come, he tells them: "These are my traveling provisions, which 
I received from BaxbakufilanuXsI'wae." ^ He asks them to point out 
what shares they desire to have when he will return. They take 
the body down and place it on a clean mat. Each points out what 
he desires to have. His return will be described later on (p. 527). 
His k-i'nqahiLala returns with him. She carries the corpse which has 
been prepared. She goes backward, facing the ha'mats'a. When she 
reaches the right side of the fire, the ha'mats'a enters the house. He 
stoops so that his face is close to the ground. On entering, he turns 
four times, descends to the middle of the house, and when he is four 
steps away from the door, he turns again four times. When the

position. After the close of the ceremonial the ha'iiiiits'a by the pay- 
ment of blankets indemnifies those whom he has bitten and the owner 
of slaves whom he has killed. 

The ceremonial of the return of the 
*ha'mats'a will be described later on, 
when an account of the whole winter 
ceremonial will be given. My object 
here is to describe the manner of 
dancing, so that I do not need to 
refer to the subject again later on. 

The ha'mats'a has two ways of 
dancing — one representing him in a 
stage of greatest excitement, the 
other when he is becoming pacified. 
His first dance and sometimes part of the second are danced in the 
former position, the others are danced in the second position. The 

first dance represents him as looking- 
for human fiesh to eat. He dances 
in a squatting position, his arms 
extended sideways and trembling 
violently (fig; ()2). He first extends 
them to the right, then to the left, 
changing at the same time the posi- 
tion of the feet so that when extend- 
ing his arms to the left he rests on 
his left foot and the right foot is ex- 
tended backward; when extending 
his arms to the right, he rests on his 
right foot and the left foot is extended backward. Thus he moves on 
slowly with long steps. His head is lifted up, as though he was looking 
for a body that was being held bigh up in 
front of him. His eyes are wide ojien, his 
lips pushed forward, and from time to time 
he utters his terrible cry, hap. His attend- 
ants surround 
him, and two of 
them hold him 
athis neck ring 
thathemaynot 
attack the peo- 
ple. When in 
the rear of the 

house, he suddenly changes his position, 
putting bis hands on his hix^s ami jumping 
in long leaps with both legs at the same 
time, his face still bearing the same expression. In this position he turns 
in the rear of the fire. Thus he continues his four circuits, changing

from time to time from the slow trembling movement to tlie long leaps. 
During this time his k-i'nqalaLala — if he is a novice — dances backward 
in front of him. She stands erect and holds her hands and forearms 
extended forward as thongh she was carrying a body for the ha'mats'a 
to eat. Then his eyes are directed to her hands, which she keei)S mov- 
ing up and down a little with each step. Her open palms are turned 

upward. In his second dance the 
ha'mats'a dances standing erect. 
While in his first dance he is naked, 
he is now clothed in a blanket. 
Now he holds his forearms upward, 
the elbows being near his flanks, the 
palms forward, the lingers lightly 
bent. His hands are still trembling 
violently. His dance consists of 
rhythmical steps coincident with 
the beats of the batons. He takes 
very high steps, so that his knees 
almost touch his chest. When rais- 
ing one foot, he bends at the same 
time the knee of the 
other leg, and thus 
drops his trunk consid- 
erably without chang- 
ing his position (Plate 
2.S), He always puts 
down the whole sole 
of his foot. 

When he first returns 
from his initiation, he 
wears a head ring, neck 
ring, waist ring, brace- 
let, and anklets made 
of hemlock branches. 
The form of these rings 
varies according to the 
legend from which tlie 
ha'mats'a derives his 
origin. While most of 
them have plain hemlock rings, one ha'mats'a of the Koskimo has his 
set with small rings of white peeled twigs, which set off clearly against 
the dark green ring of balsam pine (see p. 595). 

The painting of the face of the ha'mats'a also depends upon the 
legend from which he derives his origin. Most of them have their faces 
])ainted black all over, while others have two curved red lines on each 
cheek running from the corner of the mouth to the ear in a wide curve

are liviug on blood. According to the legend, the various ha/mats'as 
become excited by seeing certain objects or by hearing them mentioned. 
All of these refer to death. The exciting object for one hfi'mats'a is the

ghost or corpse ; for another one, skulls ; for still others, " a head cut off" 
or maggots or x-a/wayu (open door). Whenever any of these words 
occur in a song, or when a dance, figure, or painting is shown repre- 
senting these objects, the hfi'mats'a who, according to his legend, is 
affected by them falls into a state of ecstasy. 



446 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 




If the dancer is not a novice, lie dances tlie first dance with liis cedar 
bark ornaments, which the new ha'mats'a does not wear nntil his 
fourth dance. These consist of a heavy crown of plated cedar bark 
and a neck ring to correspond, anklets, and bracelets (figs. G3-G8). 

The head ring tig. G3 is set with four crosspieces. These crosspieces 
designate the gifts of the spirits who have initiated the cannibal. The 
front piece represents the milky way, the cannibal pole of Baxbaku- 
alanuXsI'wac, the two lateral pieces represent the ho'Xhok". The 
rear crosspiece is said to be merely an ornament. Some ha'mats'as 
Avcar a bear skin which is set with the scalps of the slaves whom he 
has eaten or of the enemies whom he has slain. The symbolic meaning 

of a number of crosspieces 
will be described in detail 
further on (p. 449). 

During the dances of the 
ha'mats'a whistles are 
heard (figs. 69-74), Avhich 
represent the voices of the 
spirits. Most of these 
whistles are small. They 
are made of red cedar. A 
few are made of bone. 

After his first dance, the 
ha'mats'a disappears in a 
room set apart for this xiur- 
pose in the rear of the 
house. It is called the ma/wiL, and is supposed to be the house of 
BaxbakualanuXsi'wae. Its front is painted with designs which repre- 
sent either the face of BaxbakualanuXsiVae himself or that of his 
servant the raven. The top of the front is set with fringes of red 
cedar bark (fig. 75). The room is always so arranged that when the 
ha'mats'a reappears, he comes out of the mouth of the painting on its 
front. Plate 29 shows the ha'mats'a coming out of the secret room, 
which is painted with the design of the raven. His attendants, as 
soon as he appears, run up to the secret room and hold the ha'mats'a 
at his neck ring. Then he comes forward and performs his dance. 
This room is used only by the novice. For him also a higli pole is 
erected in the middle of the rear of the house. It is called the 
ha'msp'eq, the cannibal pole. It is a mast from 30 to 40 feet high, 
which is wound with red cedar bark. At the top is a short crosspiece 
about 4 feet in length. The cedar bark extends up to it so that it 
forms a triangle at the toi) of the pole. Sometimes a triangle painted 
with the face of BaxbakualanuXsi'wae is fastened to it instead. 

As mentioned before, the novice after his first dance disappears into 
his secret room. Soon his cries are heard again, and he is seen coming- 
out backward at the side of the ma'wiL. He wears the mask of the 
raven, Qoa'qoaXualanuXsI'wae (fig. 70), which it is supposed is growing

out of bis body. He now personates tlie slave of BaxbakualauuXsI'- 
wae. Actually, it is not the same person who is wearing this mask, but 
somebody else who dances in liis place. He crouches so that the long- 
beak of tlie bird is close to the ground and turns his head with sudden 
jerks to the right and to the left. Both his hands are hidden under 
his blanket and with them he pulls strings which make the jaw of the 
mask open and shut very rapidly, thus producing a loud clappering 




•noise. As soon as the mask 
ap])ears, the singers begin 
the following song: 

\Va! Everybody is afraid of the t'sr t^s'a^■qa mask of 

BaxbaknrilaiinXsl'>tar". 
Wa! Everybody is afraid of the cannibal mask of 

Qoa'qoaXualannXsl'wat"-. 
His hooked-beak mask causes Huttering of the 

heart. 
His ho'Xhok" head mask causes fluttering of the 

heart. • 

After the dancer has moved around the fire 
four times, he disapijears behind the ma'wiL. 
Then the ha'mats'a comes forward again out 
of the mfi/wiL and dances in a squatting 
liosition as before, but perfectly naked. 
He disappears, and next a dancer, the same 
one who wore the first mask, appears, com- 
ing out backward at the side of the ma'wiL. 
He wears the mask of BaxbakualauuXsi'wae ™''^"' 
himself, and dances and moves in the same position as the Qofi/qoa- 
XualanuXsi'war. (Fig. 77 and Plate 30.) 

It will be noticed that some of these masks are set with skulls carved 
of wood. These have various meanings. They may indicate that the 
mask was obtained in war, or that as many slaves were killed for 
the novice as there are skulls attached to the mask, or finally they may 
belong traditionally to the particular ha'mats'a. Throughout these 
ceremonies it must be borne in mind that the different ha/niats'as have

each a. separate tradition, and, therefore, their masks and ornaments 
dift'er. While the dancer who wears tlie mask of BaxbakiialauuXsI'wae 
is dancing, the singers sing the following song: 

He is carrying the hfi'uiats'a head mask wliich he obtained from P>axbakualauuXsI'wae 
all aromul our world.' 

After he has danced around the fire four times he disappears, and then 
the ha'mats'a comes again from out of the ma/wiL dressed in his orna- 
ments of red cedar bark and dances in an erect position, 

Wheu an old ha'mats'a performs these dances, themasks donotappear, 
but he dances 
four times in 
succession, first 
in the squat- 
ting j)osition, 
then the latter 
part of the sec- 
ond dance and 
his third and 
fourth dances 
erect, 

TheNa'q'oaq- 
toq use for the 
novice the two 
masks repre- 
sented in fig. 78 

and Plate 31. The legend of their ha'- 
mats'a was told in the preceding chapter 
(p. 396), Tlie mask which appears first is 
the raven mask ; then the dancer performs 
his second dance, wearing the ornaments 
shown on figs. 79 and 80. His third dance 
is that of the ho'xhok" (Plate 31). His 
cedar bark headdress for the first dance 
is shown in fig. 79, for the last dance in 
fig. 80, In both dances he wears the neck 
ring fig. 81. 

The raven mask (fig. 82) belonged orig- 
inally to a ha'mats'a of the Ple'iltsnq, from whom the Kwakiutl 
obtained it by marriage. When in use, a sleeveless waist of eagle 
skins which reaches down to the hips is attached to it. The arms of 
the dancer are tied with red cedar bark above tlie elbows and at 
the wrists. He wears an ordinary neck ring. He also wears bands 
around knees and ankles and a waistband, all made of red cedar bark 
similar to those worn by the dancer represented in Plate 31. The 
legend from which the mask derives its origin is as follows: A chief

was deserted on an island by his slaves. He thought he would 
have to die of hunger. He sat down and covered his face with his 
blanket and cried. Then he heard his name being called. He looked 
up, but did not see anyone. He covered his head again. Soon his 
name was called a second time, but he could not discover anyone. The 
same haji- 



pened a third 
time. Then 
he bit a hole 
in his cedar 
bark blanket 
and i)eeped 
through it. 
Soon he saw 




a mouse com- 
ing out of a hole and calling him. He 
threw off his blanket and spoke to the 
mouse, who invited him to enter. She 
warned him, however, to take care of the 
door. The chief followed her. She led 
him down the rock to Q'O'moqoae's house. 
The door of the house was the raven, 
Qoa'qoaXualauuXsi'wae, who snapped ; 
at everybody who entered the house. 
The chief jumped through the door 
when it opened. Q'O'maqoae gave him . 
the ha'mats'a dance and the raven mask. 

In order to explain the meanings of 
the crosspieces on the head rings and 
of the attachments to the neck rings of \ 
the ha'mats'a, I must insert a few tradi- 
tions referring to this subject : 

Following is the legend of the origin \ 
of the G-agg-aenox: 

The first of the A'wa-iLala lived at 
Ts'a'wate. Their chief was Gu'mg'ila. 
His sons were Qoa'wiLpe and Xa'niats'- 
amg'ilak". They were always very happy, 
because their tribe was numerous. One 
night they were attacked, and Gu'mg-ila 
and his two sons alone were saved. When 
the day came Xa'niats'amg-ilak^' felt very ill at ease and told his father : 
''I will go into the woods. Do not try to see me, ray dear!" His father 
replied: "Only take care, my son, lest something might happen to 
you. Do nothing that is wrong, because you intend to go and obtain a 
magic treasure. Rub your bodj^ for four days with hemlock branches, 
else you will smell like man." Then they separated. The young man

■vrent iuto the woods at once and rubbed Ms body with hemlock 
branches for four days. He did not speak to anybody. Then he walked 
up the river Ts'a/wate and came to a lake. A loon swam to the shore 
and asked him: "What are you doing here?" Xa'niats'amg-ilak" 
replied: "lam looking for a magic treasure." "Take my name," said 
the loon. "Your name is now Ta'l- 
ts'aas." Then the loon flew away and 
Xa'niats'amg-ilak" left the lake and 
went ui) the river. He arrived at the 
next lake and sat down on the shore. 
Now he saw a seal coming ashore. 
The seal said: "What are you doing 
here?" He replied: "I am looking 
for a magic treasure." The seal said : 
"Take my name. Your name is now 
La'lelaweqame." The seal left him, 
and he walked farther up the river. 
Now he arrived at the great lake. 
There he sat down. Then he saw a sea lion, which swam up to the 
place where he was sitting. He asked: "What are you doing here, my 
friend"?" Xa'niats'amg-ilak" replied: "I am looking for a magic treas- 
ure," and the sea lion said: "Take my name. Your name is now 
Mo'nakoala." Then the sea lion left him. 

He went farther up the river and arrived at a very large lake. There

saw a whale emerg- 
ing and coming up to 
him. The whale 
asked : "What are 
you doing here?" 
He replied : "I am

whale said: "Take 
my name. Your name

and Qoayi'mts'e and

still felt badly and cried. There were no more lakes and he wanted to kill 
himself. For four days he stayed there and washed and rubbed his body 
with hemlock branches. Then he went to the top of the mountains. 
He came to the top of the great mountain Da'duqola. He did not see 
anything there, and walked to the great mountain Nola. He did not

see anything there. Therefore he felt badly and was about to turn 
homeward. Then he discovered steam rising halfway down the moun- 
tain. He went to that place. It was evening when he arrived there. 
He saw a lake with steep precipices all around it, like to a washtub. 
He tried to iind a way to go down to the lake. He slept during the 
night. In the morning he twisted 
cedar twigs. He made four loug 
pieces so that the end reached down 
to the water. ISTow he saw a small 
island floating on the lake. He 
climbed down the cedar rope and 
came to the lake. Then the fishes 
in the lake covered his whole body 
and sucked at it. After he had 
bathed he climbed up the rope 
again. The fishes had sucked at 
his body so that it was all covered 
with blood. In the evening he 
climbed down again. The fishes 
tormented him in the same manner. 
Then he climbed up again and saton 
the ground. The following morn- 
ing he saw a cloud descending to 
the lake. When the cloud lifted, what should he see? There was a 
canoe on the lake with fifteen men in it. Fourteen were paddling and 
one was standing in tlie bow of the canoe. He carried a spear in his 
hand. They kept close to the island. Three times they went around it. 
Then Xa'niats'amg-ilak" climbed down his rope. As soon as he reached

the water he dived and swam to the island. When he was near it, he 
raised his head. After a short time the canoe came to the place where 
he was in hiding. He took hold of the canoe under its bow. Then the 
men became afraid and rushed, to the stern of the canoe. The chief 
of the men said: "Look what stops our canoe!" One of the men saw

Xa'niats'aing-ilak" holdiug the bow of the canoe. He told the other 

men, and their chief said: "O Lord, let go! I will give you the water 

of life." But Xa'niats'amg'ilak" only 

lifted the bow of the canoe higher. 

Then the men spoke: "O Lord, I will 

give you the fire that burns everything." 

Xa'niats^img-ilak" only lifted the canoe 

still higher. 
Then the man spoke: "O Lord, let 

go, I will give you the death bringer." 

He only lifted the canoe still higher. 

"O Lord, let go, and this my canoe 

which moves by itself shall be yours 

and my winter dance names, A'myax-it 

and Ts'eg-eLilak". I am the harpooner 

of heaven." Then Xa'niats'amg'ilak" 

let go the canoe. The harpooner and his crew went out of the canoe. 

He took the water of life, the deatli bringer, and the fire, and put them 

into the canoe. Then he took the canoe 
and squeezed it in his hands, so that it 
became small, and he put his cedar bark 
ornamentsontheheadof Xa'niats'amg'i- 
lak". Then the harpooner told him what 
to do. He said: "Take care! Sprinkle 
the water of life on him whom you want 
to resuscitate. If you show your fire 
whatever you point at will be burnt, 
however fiir it may be ; and when you go 
to war, take the death bringer, and all 
your enemies will die. And you will kill 
all the sea monsters and all kinds of 
animals. When you want to go any- 
where in your canoe, just put it into the 
water, go aboard, and say, 'paddle.' 
Then its paddles will move by themselves. 
Its name is 'Paddle side canoe.'" 

Then the man disappeared and Xa'ni- 
ats'amg-ilak" went home. When he was 
near his home, he took the fire and tried 
it on the mountains on the one side of 
the house of Gu'mg-ila. They burnt 
right away. Then he was glad. Now 
Gu'mg-ila saw the mountain burning 
and spoke to his other son: "O dear! 
your brother has done well," for he 

thought that it was he who made the mountain burn. Not long after 

Xa'niats'amg-ilak" entered his lather's house. They gave him to eat 

and he told everything to his father, about his red cedar bark and about

Then Xa'uiats'amg'ilak" took off 



the names. After lie bad told his father, he said: "I:Tow let us make 
war upon all the people of the world. Take a good canoe. We want 
to find them who kdled all our friends." 

His father said: "Yes, my son; I think you have obtained magic 
power. Let us go to-morrow. Only take care of the sea monsters." 
Then Gu'mg-ila cleaned a good canoe and put the mats and paddles 
into it in the evening. The next 
morning he launched the canoe. 
Then Xa'niats'amg-ilak" made him- 
self ready and went aboard. He 
called his brother Qoa'wiLpe, and 
he went aboard also. Gu'mg-ila 
stayed ashore. Then Xa'niats'- 
amg-ilak" said to his brother: "I 
do not like our canoe, and I will 
change it." Then he took his small 
stick out of his head ring and in\t it 
into the water. At once it became a 
canoe with five paddles on each side. 
He jumped into it and called his 
brother. He also jumped aboard, 
his cedar bark ring and took out the wood carving in shape of a beaver. 
He said to his canoe "y i i i," and he pointed the fire bringer to the 
upper end of the village and it caught fire; then to the lower end of 
the village, and it also caught fire. Xow he told his canoe : " Paddle !" 

and it jjaddled. Then Gu'mg-ila 
was glad to see that his son was 
a magician. They were going to 
Ga'yux, and there they met the 
monster sea otter. He struck it 
with the death bringer, and it was 
transformed into a stone. He ar- 
rived at Ga'yux. Then he saw the 
village and went ashore. He was 
invited and the people fed the two 
brothers. After tliey had eaten, 
Xa'niats'amg-ilak" asked his host: 
"Who are you, brother!" He 
replied: "I am XEnri'lag-ila, and . 
this is my wife, Yo'lagilayukoa." 
Then Xa'niats'amg-ilak" said: "Thank you, my brother. I am Xa'ni- 
ats'amg-ilak", the son of Gu'mg-ila. This is my elder brother, Qo'a- 
wiLpe." Then NEua'lag-ila asked: "Where are you goiugf He 
replied : " We will go up this river." " Don't do that, master, else you 
will have bad lack, because there are monster herrings there." Xa'ni- 
ats'amg-ilak" replied : " Don't you know the monster at TsaXuala where 
canoes cross the inlet? I vanquished it." Then he called his elder

brotlier and said: "Now I will change your name." He took liis broth- 
er's hands and rubbed the death bringer over them. They were turned 
into stone, and he spoke : " Now your name shall be T'etesumx-stsana." 
l?JEna'lag-ila said : " O, master ! you are not a common man. Now I see 
what kind of a man you are. You will make war upon the monster 

herrings of whom we are 
afraid ; but be careful." The 
canoe paddled, and he ar- 
rived at that lake. When 
they were in the middle of 
the lake, the monster her- 
rings came. He struck his 
fire at them, but it did not 
kill them. They jumped into 
the canoe and it foundered. 
Then Xa'niats'amg-ilak" and 
his brother were dead. That 
is the end. 

Figures 83 to 91 represent 
the cedar bark ornaments of Xa'niats'amg-ilak". In fig. 83 is shown the 
head ring which he wears in his first dance. The upright piece in front 
represents the magic canoe which he obtained in the lake, as related on 
page 452. The upright pieces at both sides of his second head ring (fig. 
84) represent the fire bringer. ' The crosspiece on the forehead of his 
third head ring (fig. 85) represents the 
death bringer. Figure 86 shows his 
first neck ring, which has four rings at- 
tached to it. By these the attendants 
hold him when he is dancing the ha'- 
mats'a dance. The front crosspiece of 
his second neck ring (fig. 87) designates 
that he has the powers of a shaman, the 
other one that he was made a ha'mats'a 
by encountering the spirits. Figures 
88 and 89 are the rings which the dan- 
cer who personifies Xa'niats'amg'ilak" 
wears in feasts during the winter-dance 
season. There are still two other rings 
worn by the dancer which refer to a por- 
tion of the legend not contained in the preceding version. The crosspiece 
on the head ring (fig. 90) represents the death bringer which he obtained 
in the lake, while the crosspieces and the front of the neck ring (fig. 91) 
represent the si'siuL which he obtained from Ts'a'eqame. 
Figures 92 to 95 are the ornaments of Lexx-a'lix'ilagu. According

to tradition, KoniasE'nxelis, an ancestor of tlie Naqo'mg-ilisala liad 
a son named LExx-a/lix-ilagfi (p. 335), who obtained liis dances from 
the sI'siaL and from the wolves. His first head ring (fig. 92) shows six 
crosspieces in front. These are the death bringers, and the npright 
piece on toj) is the fire bringer, while the square behind represents the 

bucket containing the water of life. 
In his second head ring (fig. 93) 
only four death bringers are shown. 
This ring is worn in his second 
dance. As will be described below, 
the Naqo'mg'ilisala and La'Lasi- 
qoala take off some of the symbols 
which designate the supernatural 
powers of the dancer after each 
dance. The ring shown in fig. 94 
is stripped of all these crosspieces 
and is worn by the dancer in feasts. 
The dancing neck ring (fig. 95) has 
two crosspieces on the sides. These 
symbolize the gifts of the sI'siuL, 
while the gifts of the wolves are 
symbolized by the attachments in 
front and in the back. 
Another ha'mats'a of the La'Lasiqoala, on returning from the woods, 
dances four nights with wreaths of hemlock branches; the following 
four nights (the fifth to the eighth) without any ornaments; then 
four nights (the ninth to the twelfth) with ornaments of red cedar 
bark. He wears eight bundles over his forehead, which are called 
k''a'siwe, and four on 
each side. The next 
night, after he has fin- 
ished dancing, one of the 
k-'a'siwe is taken off, 
which is publicly an- 
nounced the following 
morning. The four- 
teenth night two more 
of these bundles are 
taken away; the next, 
two more; and finally, 
the sixteenth, one more, 
which is also publicly an- 
nounced each morning. 
The seventeenth night 
a black line is drawn over his face from the left side of his forehead 
to the right side of his chin, and then he rises to bite people. Later 
on he is excited by mistakes and by songs of the ghost dancer. The 
head ring is meant to symbolize the moon, and the decrease in the

size of the ring is said to signify the waning of the moon. When the 
ha'mats'a retnrns, a bloody line runs over his face, beginning on the 
cheeks, curving up toward the nose, which it crosses in its upper por- 
tion. It is said to designate the moon. The line is made by rubbing 
the face with doglish skin. It is said that this line indicates the efiect 
of Wina'lag'ilis's canoe, which rubbed against the face of the novice. 

Each ha'mats'a has eight songs of his own, which are composed for 
him by the na'qate at the time of his return from the woods, and are 
sung whenever he dances. 

A young man who first becomes a member of a secret society can not 
join the ha'mats'a until after a number of years. For seven years he 
must have been a member of societies of lower rank. Then in the 

eighth year he may become a 
ha'mats'a. 

The ha'matsa's first initia- 
tion is called g*i'yak-ila. 
After four seasons he may be 
given another ha'mats'a by 
his father. This is called ta. 
After he has been initiated 
four times (yuduXp'Ena ta — 
three times gone into it), he 
may leave the ranks of the 
ha'mats'a and become a que'- 
qutsa. This is called "lock- 
ing the whistles into the box." 
This is accomplished in the 
following way: Whenthemas- 
ter of ceremonies assembles 
all the people (qap'e'k", see p. 
502), all the ha'mats'as stand 
up; then the one who desires to join the que'qutsa says: ^ "I will not 
stand up before you. I want to be que'qutsa." He is asked why he 
desires to do so, but only replies:^ "I have finished being hfi'mats'a." 
Then the people reply : ^ " Let your whistles be quiet," and he says :* '^ I 
will keep my whistles quiet." The same statements must be made by 
other members -of the seal society who desire to become que'qutsa. 

On the following day the master of ceremonies sends his messengers 
to invite to the qap'e'k". The man who desires to become a que'qutsa

must join tliem. He is iJiiinted with tlie particular design which used 

to excite him — a head, maggots, the raven, the x-a'wayh, or the corpse. 

When painting them, the people hold them tight and torment them. 

The skull is i)ainte(l in black on the 

ha'mats'a's face; the maggots are 

represented by numerous little dots, 

and the x-a/wayil is indicated by 

a rope. The painting representing 

the corpse are feet, because when the 

ha'mats'a enters the house carrying 

a corpse, its feet are always visible 

under the blanket. 

Painted in this manner he accom- 
panies the messengers, who carry 
long staffs (que'sp'eq). Theha'mats'a 
pretends that he can not do the work 
assigned to the messengers properly. 
When they call a name, they always 
strike the threshold with their staffs. 
The ha'mats'a stands in their midst 
and they strike his feet with their 
staffs when calling a name. In short, 
he is maltreated in all conceivable 
ways, ] )articularly by his rival. If he 
can not endure the torments longer, 
he will rush to the seat of the seal society. The people pull him back, 
push him, and tear his clothes. Then he gets excited and bites the people. 

Following are a number of songs of the ha'mats'a: 

ha'mats'a song composed recently 15Y QOAYO'STETSAS. ' 

1. I am ooing all around the world eating everywhere with BaxbakuiilauuXsI'wae. 

2. I give you no time to escape from me when I go with BasbakualannXsi'wae. 

3. I am .at the center of the world; 
for me BaxbakualaniiXsI'wae 
is crying hap. 

4. I am at the post of the Avorld; 
for me BaxbakualanuXsi'wae 
is crying hap. 

When the ha'mats'a moves 
his trembling arms from right 
to left, lie indicatesby gestures 
the contents of the song. In 
the x>receding song the ges- 
tures are as follows : With the 
words "I am going," the arms 
are stretched out to one side; " all around the world," the arms swing 
around in a wide circle; "I," the shoulders are alternately brought

forward and backward — this means that the dancer himself is being 
referred to; "eating everywhere," the right hand stretches far out, as 
though it was taking food, and is then brouglit to the mouth, while the 

left describes a wide circle, indi- 
cating everywhere; "Baxbaku- 
alauuXsi'wae," both hands are 
bent inward and the finger tips 
moved toward the mouth, mean- 
ing the eater. 

I did not see the dance of the 
second line. In order to explain 
the gestures of the third line, I 
must give a literal translation: 
"I went, you cried 'hap' for 
me, BaxbakuillanuXsI'wae, at 
the center of the world." " I 
went," gesture as above, "you 
cried 'hap' for me, BaxbakualanuXsI'wae," both hands bent inward 
move to the mouth, as above, designating the cannibal spirit; then 
the arms are stretched far backward, the palms turned downward, 
and the head is lowered, this being the cannibal spirit's attitude 
when crying hap. The same attitude is taken by the dancer wear- 
ing the mask (fig. 77) when he clatters with its movable jaw, at the

The mention of the north refers to the fact that the composer is a 
descendant of the Tongass by his mother's side. He claims to have 
obtained his ha'mats'a from her tribe. 

ha'mats'a song composed about fifty years ago.' 

1. Food ■will be given to me, food will be given to me, because I obtained this magic 

treasure. 

2. I am swallowing food alive; I eat living men. 

3. I swallow wealth; I swallow the wealth that my father is giving away. 

The presents given away at the time of the initiation of the ha'mats'a 
and at his later dances are said to be swallowed by him. The song 
means, therefore, that through his ecstasy his Mher was compelled to 
give away much wealth. 

ha'mats'a song of THK LAU'lTSiS.' 

1. I went all around the world to find food. 

2. I went all around the world to find human flesh. 

3. I went all around the world to find human heads. 

4. I went all around the world to find corpses. 

ha'mats'a song of the koskimo.' 

1. You will be known all over the world; you will be known all over the world, 

as far as the edge of the world, you great one Avho safely returned from the

2. You will be known all over the world; yon will be known all over the world, 

as far as the edge of the world. You went to BasbakualanuXsi'wae, and there 
you ate first dried human flesh. 

3. You were led to his cannibal pole in the place of honor of his house, and his house 

is our world. 

4. You were led to his cannibal pole, which is the milky way of our world. 

5. You were led to his cannibal pole at the right-hand side of our world. 

This song was sung for a youth who had taken the place of another 
one who had died. Therefore the song says that he safely returned 
from the spirits. The text says : " You returned from la'lag-ilis," which 
is another name for the spirit of the winter dance. The milky way is 
the cannibal pole of BaxbakualanuXsI'wae; in other cases (see p. 405) 
it is the rainbow.

ha'mats'a song, la'lasiqoala.2 

1. Truly ! He goes around the whole world, the great ha'mats'a, looking for food every- 

where, the great ha'mats'a, on both sides of the world. 

2. Truly ! He Avants to eat plenty, the great ha'mats'a. He is trying to eat all himself, 

the great ha'mats'a, but he did not reach the food that he was going to obtain 
at the edge of the world. 

3. He wants to cat with l)Oth hands, the great ha'mats'a, at the house of the one who 

is trying to eat all himself all over the world; but he did not reach the coppers 
that he was going to obtain at the edge of the world. 

This translation is not quite certain. The song refers to the Goasi'la 
who in olden times had many dances and did not want to give them to 
the other Kwakiutl tribes, who desired to obtain them through mar- 
riage. The La''Lasiqoala heard that the Goasi'la intended to invite 
them to their winter dance. They were invited and started to go, but 
their chief was afraid, it seems, and returned back without attending 
the feast.

K-i'NQALAT.ALA SONG.' 

1. P.egin! You whose eagle dowu which is strewn all over her body, fills the liouse, 

who brings all the people together from all over the world. 

2. Begin! You who make the people weak, tempting with food those who ate too 

much, whose body makes the people of the whole world oversatiated. 

3. Begin ! You who pile the red-hot stoues up to the roof of the house all over the 

world. 

The girl wlio danced this k-i'iKjalaLala was a prostitute in her tribe. 

She is scourged in this song. The composer meant by the eagle down 

and the piles of red stones the young men who came in crowds to her 

house. The meaning of the second verse becomes also clear from this 

l)oint of view. 

k-1'nqalalala song." 

1 . BaxbakualannXsI'wae cries hap for me ; he utters the ha'mats'a cry for me. I have 

the great supernatural power. 

2. BaxbakuiilauuXsi'wae and his companion have thrown the sound of whistles, the 

sound of the magic power into me. I have the great supernatural power. 

3. I reached tlie place where the excitiug cry of BaxbakualanuXsi'wae and his com- 

panion is heard. I have the great magical power. 

K-t'NQALALALA SONG.' 

1. The sounds of the winter dance are heard wherever you are, great one. 

2. Ha'mats'a cries are heard wherever you are, great one. 

3. You went right up to the raven, and the sound of fighting ravens is heard wherever 

you are. 

4. You went right up to the shutting mouth, and the sound of the ho'Xhok" is heard 

wherever you are. 

5. You went right up to him who carries one corpse on each arm for you. 

The hiVmats'a cry "hap" was obtained by the Kwakiutl through 
intermarriage with the Awi'k''en6x. Tlie dancer was by descent partly 
Awi'k-'enox. Therefore the song says that he carried the ha'mats'a 
cry through the world. (Line 4, shutting mouth=the ho'Xhok".)

1. I have the winter dance song, I have magic powers. 

2. I have the hfi'mats'a song, I have magic powers. 

3. I have BaxbakualanuXsi'wae's song, I have magic powers. 

4. Your magic power killed the people, and therefore they all hide before you, fear- 

ing your great power. 

This song belonged to a man who had killed a chief of the Qoe'xsot'- 
enox, and the song refers to this fact. Later on he was killed by a 
Qoe'xsot'enox, who now owns the song.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 




The k'i'iiqalaLala to wliom belonged tliis song, used the rattles shown 
in figs. 96, 97. Each rattle represents a raven with a skull on its back; 
a fish is shown on its stomach. The skull indicates that the ha/mats'a 

is tilled with the desire of eating 
skulls. The form of the rattle 
is evidently suggested by the 
beautiful northern raven rattles. 
(See pp. 623,629.) 

This song was also made for a 
girl of ill repute who had spread 
the syphilitic contagion among 
her tribes. To this refers the re- 
mark: "I cut the veins of the 
wild monster." The singers 
mean that she is infecting every- 
body, even the wild monster. 

q'o'minoqa. 

The q'o'minoqa dance was ob- 
tained recently, through inter- 
marriage, from the La'Lasiqo- 
ala. The novice also disappears 
in the woods to be initiated 
by BaxbakualanuXsI'wae. 
^- ^""^^ When she is brought back by 

the tribe, her hair is falling out, and her head is covered with blood, 
because it is torn by BaxbakualanuXsrwae. She is carrying a skull in 
each hand. As soon as she is seen, 
the ha'mats'as begin to cry hap and 
dance squatting with trembling 
hands up to her, full of desire to de- 
vour the heads which she is carry- 
ing. The other q'o'minoqas and 
those who have formerly been 
q'o'minoqa join her dance and move 
as though they were carrying heads. 
Thus she dances into the house, al- 
ways surrounded by the ha'mats'as, 
who finally take the skulls out of 
her hands and lick them and eat the 
maggots and the dry skin that is still 
attached to them. When returning, 
the q'o'minoqa is dressed in hemlock 
in the same way as the ha/mats'a. 
Loose hair is placed on her head and alder juice is streaming down her 
hair, giving the appearance as though she was bleeding profusely and 
as -though her hair was falling out, being torn off by BaxbakuillanuX-

3. Q'o'minoqa's left side is foreboding evil. 

4. Q'o'minoqa's right side is foreboding good. 

By the La'Lasiqoala the q'o'minoqa dance is sometimes called yiai'- 
atalaL. Among them she has the ornament shown in fig. 98. One of 
her songs is as follows :^ 

1. Trnly, the people join your dance. 

2. Because you are carrying a rattle in your hand while you dance, they join in your 
praise. 

3. On account of all that you are carrying in your hand, they join in your praise. 

THE HA'MSHAMTSES. 

The Kwakiutl state that before obtaining the ha'mats'a from the 
He'iltsuq they had only the ha'mshamtsES, who is also initiated by 
BaxbakurdanuXsi'wae. Nowadays he is considered as inferior to the 
ha'mats'a, and the dance belongs almost 
exclusively to women. The ceremonial fol- 
lowing the ha'mshamtsEs's return from his 
or her initiation is the same as that of th6 
return of the ha'mats'a. The ornaments 
are also of the same description, except 
that his cedar bark is not twisted and 
plaited,- but simply wound around his head, 
neck, wrists, and ankles. He does not use 
a ma'wiL. His cry is not hap, but wip. Fig. 98. 

He does not dance in a squatting position, head ring of q'o'minoqa.

hands are trembling. After his first dance, 

which, as all others, consists of four rounds, he reappears wearing a 
mask. This is either a head mask, similar to the QoaqoaXualanuX- 
si'wae mask described on page 447 or it is a full face mask. Almost 
all of these represent animals, the protectors of the dancer. It has 
not become clear to me why it is that so many different animals may 
become the protectors of the ha'mshamtsES. 

I will describe a few of these masks and give the songs wliich belong 
to them. Figure 99 is a ha'mshamtsEs mask, the outer figure of which 
represents the grizzly bear. The inner face represents Baxbakurd- 
anuXsi'wae. The red rim around the mask is blood, which is shown 
because the bear is cut open in order to make the inner face visible.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



The paiiitinj? of the face represents parts of his body. The chin tuft 
is at tlie same time the uvula. It is the opinion of the Kwakiutl that 
the uvula is the cause of hunger, and that BaxbakualanuXsI'-wae has a 
very large uvula, which is the cause of his voracity. The mustache 
represents his legs ; the green blots on the cheeks, his body. The ears 
are painted over the eye, and have the shape of a raven's ears. The 
blue ornament on the forehead is merely painting, intended to fill a 
gap that did not please the artist. The peculiar shape of the nose is 
called " voracious nose," and is meant to indicate that he can scent 
man a long distance off. The name of the owner of this mask, as a 
member of the "seal society," is always JSIa'wis. After he joins the

were the first to utter the hfi'mats'a cry, you great supernatural one. You were 
the first one into whom BaxbakualanuXsi'wae threw his power. Your power is 
(lesiri'd even at the edge of the world. Everybody desires to possess your 
powers. 

In connection with the mask shown in fig. 103 (p. 4()8) the following 
song is sung:^ 

1. "I went all around the world with my protector, looking for I'ood on the beach." 

2. "Tlius I went and he took his cedar bark ornaments from his body and hung 

them on to me." Therefore everybody wishes to have your power, but nobody 
in the whole world can imitate you.

NO'NTStSTALAL, 

This dance is also said to have 
been obtained comparatively re- 
cently by marriage from the Awi'- 
k-'enox. The novice is also initi- 
ated by BaxbakualanuXsi'wae, and 
has the power to handle fire with 
impunity. In his ecstasy he takes 
up glowing coals, puts them into 
his mouth, and throws them upon 
the people. At the end of the 
dancing season he must pay for all 
the damage done in this manner. 
His ornaments are made of red and 
white cedar bark. Following is a

NA'NE, THE GRIZZLY BEAR. 

There are two degrees of this society, BaxbakualanuXsi'wae's grizzly 
bear and tlie ordinary grizzly bear. The former is the higher in rank. 
Both are among the most important members of the seal society. 
While all the preceding ones belong to the laxsa, they are wl'xsa.^ 
Therefore at the time of the initiation they are not taken away by the 
spirit, but are only hidden in a corner of the house, whence they come

forward when they are ready, to show that tliey have been initiated. 
They are perhaps the most dreaded helpers of the ha/inats'a, as it is 
their duty, in conjunction with the nii'LmaL, to punish all transgres- 
sions of laws referring to privileges of the ha'mats'a, or to the winter 
ceremonial in general. I stated before that the penalty of some mis- 
takes was death. The unfortunate ones were killed by the grizzly 
bears and nfi'LmaL. They are also the watchers of the dancing house, 
and often witli the other members of the seal society assemble on the 
roof, and by their wild cries and threatening attitude frighten away 
everybody. They always, wear bear's claws on their hands, and some- 
times appear clad in bearskins. Their faces are painted in imitation 
of an immense mouth of a bear. Their head rings and neck rings are 
made of red and white cedar bark. Each of these is twisted in a tight 
rope. Then they are twisted around each other and tied at their ends

(figs. Ill, 112, pp. 473, 474). Their circuit around the fire can hardly 
be called a dance. In the first and the third dances the dancer wears 
Ms cedar bark ornaments. The dances consist in violent motions of 
the body, imitating the actions of a bear who sits on his haunches. 
Every now and then the dancer' growls and scratches the ground with 
his paws. In the second and fourth dances he appears clad in a bear- 
skin, walks on hands and feet, and paws the ground, imitating the 
motions of an angry bear.

THE NU'LMAL. 

The iioo'iiLEinaLa (pi. of iiu'LmaL) or ''fool dancers" are also mes- 
sengers and helpers of the ha'mat'sa, who help to enforce the laws 

referring- to the ceremo- 
nial. Their method of 
attack is by throwing 
stones at people, hitting 
them with sticks, or in se- 
rious cases stabbing and 
killing them with lances 
and war axes. 

The noo'nLEuuiLa are 
initiated by a fabulous 
people, the A'Lasimk', 
who are believed to live 
near a lake inland from 
LiXsI'wae. Their village 
is believed to be on an is- 
land floating on the lake. 
They have enormous noses 
and their bodies are cov- 
ered with snot. In olden 
times a man went beaver 
hunting and fell in with 
these people. He came 
back exhausted and 
"crazy." His nose was 
running all the time; heate 
the mucus and smeared it 
all over his body. He 
urinated and defecated in 
the house, and only after 
a long time did the people succeed in restoring him to his senses. 

From him the noo'uLEniaLa are said to derive their origin. They are 
supposed to be out of their senses and to have long noses. They are as 
filthy as the first nri'Ln)aL is said to have been. Some of them when 
initiated are taken away by the A'Lasindc", others are initiated in the 
house. The noo'uLEmaLa are wl'xsa. Those who are to be initiated in 
the house will all of a sudden begin to scratch their heads and bodies. 
They scratch more and more violently. This indicates that they are

possessed by tlie winter dance spirit. After four days they are confined 
in tlie corner of the house, and appear as uoo'uLEiuaLa at the time of 
the next dance. When a young man is to be initiated in this order, 
the old noo'nLEmaLa will throw mucus from their nose on to him and 
thus "-throw the spirit of the winter ceremonial into him." 

The uu'LmaL, according to what was stated above, is filthy and acts 
as though he was out of his senses. His cry is we, we, we. Paintings 
of fool dancers are shown on Plate 33. They do not dance, but, when 
excited, run about like madmen, throwing stones, knocking people 
down, and crying. They turn 
to the right instead of to 
the left, and make the cir- 
cuit of the fire turning to 
the left. Then the qur-'qutsa 
try to correct them, but they 
grow only the more excited. 
They dislike to see clean and 
beautiful clothing. They tear 
and soil it. They break ca- 
noes, houses, kettles, and 
boxes ; in short, act the mad- 
man in every conceivable 
way. At the close of the 
dancing season they must in- 
demnify the owners for all the 
property destroyed. 

The noo'nLEmaLa wear 
lances and war clubs during 
the ceremonials, with which 
they kill the offenders of the 
hiVmats'a (figs. 113-116, pp. "'"'"'"''• 

475, 176). Many of these lances are carved and painted with the design 
of the raven. The nod'uLEmaLa wear rings of red cedar bark, which 
is simply tied around their heads and hung around their necks. It is 
not plaited. 

When they first appear after their initiation, and also when per- 
forming their ceremonial dance they use masks. All these masks are 
characterized by long noses of curiously round shape. The face is 
surrounded by a red ring which represents the red cedar bark. The 
type of these masks has not changed during the last century. There 
is one in the U. S. National Museum that was collected by the Wilkes 
Expedition (fig. 117, p. 477). Another old specimen is in the British 
Museum (Plate 34). The similarity of this type of mask and of the 
newer ones collected of late years will be noticed (figs. 118-122, pp. 
477-479). Any mention of a long nose excites the nu'LmaL. He does 
not allow his nose to be touched.

SONG OF nu'lmal, la'laslqoala." 

1. Oh wonder! He is making a turmoil on the earth. 

2. Oh wonder! He makes the noise of falling objects on the earth. 

3. Oh wonder! He makes the noise of breaking objects on the earth. 

There is a chief iiu'LmaL, 
who is called G'eqameq'd- 
LEla or O'lnaq'o'LEla. It 
is stated that nine genera- 
tions ago TsEx'ue/te, chief 
of the Si'siuLae, had a son 
who was a nii'LmaL, He 
gave a feast and said that 

he wanted to make his son chief of all the noo'nLE- 
luaLa and call him G-e'qameq'oLEla. He sent him 
to be initiated as a nu'LmaL once more, and when 
he came'back, he distributed an immense amount of 
property, sea-otter skin blankets, canoes, slaves, coji- 
pers, etc. As he was unable to bring all this x)roperty 
into the house, he scattered eagle down, which sym- 
bolized the property, all over his guests. Since that 
time "property is the lance of the G-e'qameq'oLEla," 
and the father of a new G*e'qameqoLEla must dis- 
tribute all his i^roperty at the time of the initiation 
of the novice. 

The Ha'wayadalaL is one of the highest fool 
dancers. He carries a knife in his right hand, and 
moves it along his neck as though he was cutting- 
it. Then he changes the knife to his left hand, and 
repeats the same motion. In doing so he stabs 
himself, or pretends to do so, actually stabbing his 
neck ring, which is filled with a bladder containing 
blood.

sewed all over it at regular intervals of about 10 inches, and a head mask 
with a long beak surmounting his forehead (figs. 124 and 125, p. 479).

The dance is sometimes also called " the dance of the wind." The lively 
motions of the blanket are supposed to be caused by the winds of 
the higher regions of the atmosphere (Plate 35). The dancer is initiated 

at BaxbakualanuXsi'wae's house. He 

is wi'xsa.

want the La'Lasiqoala to have it. They invited the Awi'lc'enox to a 
place named Qoa'qumr', under the pretext that they were going to 
give a feast. When the Awl'k-'euox came, 
they killed many of them, among others 
the father of Q'o'mEuakula's wife. Thus 
the He'iltsuq recovered the mask, and 
(>>/d'mEnakula could not obtain it. Later

in the woods. The novice who is to acquire this dance disappears in 
the woods. When he returns, he bites the people, not like the ha'inats'a, 
but imitating the voracious ha"maa. His cedar bark rings are like 
those of the bear dancer, but smaller. His cry is " hup ! hup ! " When 
returning from the woods, he does not wear hemlock, but red cedar 
bark ornaments. The dancer's name as member of the seal society is 
K-'O/k-aLElayu (of whom all are afraid); his que/qutsa name is ALtsala 
(coming ashore from the middle of the lake). His song is as follows:

This dance belongs to the La'Lasiqoala. The novice disappears and 
stays in the woods several months. When he is brought back, the

people liide all the eagle down, the symbol of wealth, 
but put it on when he enters, indicating that the salmon 
brings affluence. He is greeted with the cry " haioho'." 
The amount of property distributed by the dancer's 
father is as large as that needed for initiating a ha'- 
mats'a. His dance is intended to imitate the motions 
of the jumping salmon. He holds his head sideways 
and dances with stiff legs, the feet remaining at the 
same spot, the body turning first to the right then to 
the left. His forearms are bent upward, the open palms 
stretched forward. Following is his song: 

1. Many salmon are coming ashore with me. 

2. They are coniing ashore to you, the post of our heaven. 

3. They are dancing from the salmon's country to the shore. 

4. I come to dance before you at the right-hand side of the world, 

overtowering, outshining, surpassing all; I, the salmon. 

SONG OF A SALMON DANCER.' 

1. The salmon came to search for a dancer. 

2. He came and x)ut his supernatural power into him. 

3. You have supernatural power. Therefore the chief of the 

salmon came from beyond the ocean. The people praise you, 
for they cannot carry the weight of your wealth. 

THE SALMON WEIR DANCE.'^ 

The weir in the legends of the Kwakiutl is a toy of 
the salmon. The salmon weir dancer is initiated by the 
salmon. The dance belongs at present to the Maa'm- 
tag'ila, who obtained it by marriage from the Awi'- 
k*'endx. The novice remains in the woods for about 
one month. When he returns, he is naked. His body 
is smeared with the juice of a plant, which makes it 
very slippery. His cedar bark ornaments are similar 
to those of the ha/mats'a, but much smaller. The 
dancer first rests on one leg, his body bent almost hori- 
zontally at one side, the other leg extended to the other 
side. Then he changes to the other leg, bending his 
body to the other side and extending his other leg. 
Here is his song: 

1. I went to work at my salmon weir. When I took out the sal- 

mon, their eyes were picked out by the crows. Fig. 113.

WALAS'AXA'.^ 

The Wrdas'axa' is a peculiar wolfs dance. It belongs to the legend 
of O'maxt'a/laLc (see p. 382), who obtained it by marrying the daughter 
of Qfiwatiliqala. The Walas'axa' is danced in 
the following way: All the men of the tribe 
dress in blankets and headdresses representing 
the wolf. They hide behind a curtain which 
stretches across the rear of the house, and when 
the singers open their song, come forth from the 
right-hand entrance of the curtain. There two 
criers are stationed, who hold staffs and an- 
nounce their arrival. As soon as a dancer ap- 
pears, he turns and proceeds on a march around 
the fire. The fists are held forward, the 

When the dancers 
arrive in front of 
the door, they 
turn once and 
then x^i'oceed 
aronnd the fire, 

disappearing again behind the cnrtain, 
at the left-hand side. When all have 
disappeared, two more circuits are made 
in the same manner. In the fourth cir- 
cuit they stop when all have come out. 
They squat down on hands and feet, imi- 
tating the motions of wolves. They rest 
on their toes and knuckles and turn 
their heads to the right and to the left. 
In fig. 140 (p. 493) and in Plate 37 a number of the masks used in the 
Walas'axa' are shown. Some of these claim particular interest, as they

type of these masks has taken place during the last century. The teeth 
of the mask (Plate 37) are made of dentalia, and 
the trail is carefully worked of cedar bark. 



THE LO'KOALA. 

There is still another wolf dance, which is derived 
from traditions of the initiation of men by the wolves. 
The tradition underlying this dance is that of Mink 
and the wolves. The sons 
of the chief of the wolves 
were i)reparing to be initi- 
ated. Mink found and 
killed them and thus ob- 
tained their names and 
places. He came back 
wearing the wolf's scalp as 
a head mask. Three times 

he danced around the fire, covering his face and 

his head with his blanket. Then the fourth 

time he uncovered it and thus showed that he 

had killed the wolves. All the animals tried to 

kill him, but were unable to do so. I shall 

give the full legend later on. Mink, whose 

que'qutsa name is K-ex*, thus obtained the 

wolf's name, Nun, as a member of the seal society, and also the wolf's 

Lo'koala or supernatural power. This tradition belongs to the clan

song is intended to excite the uOo'nLEraaLa, who are considered as the 
friends of the wolf chiefs whom K-ex* had killed. 
They are excited by the mention of the words " mid- 
dle of the face," i. e., nose, in the following song: 

Mink put on his bead the middle of the face of NoLt'a- 
qalag'ills.' 

Before singing, the dancer goes three times 
around the fire, covering his head with his blanket. 
Then he unfolds it. He wears the headdress. 
His cheeks are each painted with a black circle, 
the inside of which is red. He puts his hands 
flat to his nose (both in the medial line, one close 
to the other), dances, and sings the preceding- 
song. Then the noo'nLEmaLa all try to attack 
him while the que'qutsa protect him.

Although the Ts'o'noqoa is not an animal, but a fabulous being, 

as described before, this 
seems the most appropri- 
ate iilace to mention her 
dance and songs. She is 
a member of the seal soci- 
ety. She is represented 
as always asleep. When 
the dancer enters the 
house, a rope is stretched 
from the door to her seat, 
along which she feels her 
way. She does not dance, 
but walks once around the 
fire, attired in the com- 
plete skin of a bear, which 

fits over her body and to which her mask is attached. Figs. 13, 141-144 

(pp.372, 494-49G) represent a series 

of typical Ts'o'noqoa masks. The 

last one was obtained from the La'- 

Lasi(j[oala. Her songis as follows:^ 

1 . I was a little too late to witness the 

blood of his victims, to see the 
putrid heap of those whom he had 
killed, to see the remains of the 
food of the warrior of the world. 

2. He was made great ; he was made wild 

by his father.3 He will not take 
pity. He will kill. He comes to 
make poor the tribes.

SONG- OF THE Sl'SIUL DANCE, LA'LASIQOALA.' 

1. Great is the sl'siuL dauce of our chief. 

2. They say by his dance he will cut in two a whole tribe. '^ 

AO'MALAL, OR GHIEFTAINESS DANCE. 

I did not see the dance and do not know any details as i^egards initi- 
ation, etc. I received the following description : The Ao'nialaL is said 
to sit on a stage in front of the ma/wiL. She has the chieftainess's 
ornaments of abalone shells in her ears and attached to her nose. She 
does not move, but is merely shown behind the curtain while the people 
sing her song.' It is probable that this dance is a recent introduction 
from the north. In the winter ceremonial of the Tsimsshiaii the dancer 
appears in the manner here described on a stage, and after the song 
the stage is hidden again behind a curtain. 

SONG OF AO'MALAL, 

1. We are told that our great chief lets his daughter dance as chieftainess. 

2. Great is the song of the chieftainess, great is the ha'mats'a song of the super- 

natural chieftainess. 

3. At the place of the great suiiernatural chieftainess is heard the sound of cojiper, 

the ringing of copper. 

GHOST DANCE. 

I stated in Chapter YP how the ghost dauce of the L'a/sq'enox 
originated. There are a number of traditions of similar character ex- 
plaining the origin of the ceremony among various tribes. All these 
traditions contain descriptions of a visit to the world of the ghosts, 
which is believed to be located under our world. Then the visitor was 
given the secrets of the ghost dance and other magical gifts. This 
dance is a mimical representation of a visit to the lower Avorld. 
The dancer wears the head ring and neck ring, figs. 146, 147* which 
are set with skulls, indicating that the ghosts have initiated him. 
Elaborate preparations are made for this dance. During the days pre- 
ceding it the members of the seal society hold close watch that nobody 
enters the dancing house in which they remain assembled. Then a 
ditch is dug behind the fire, and speaking tubes made of kelp are laid 
under the lloor of the house so as to terminate in the fire. The ghost 
dancer appears, led by a rope by one attendant. He goes around the 
fire four times, summoning the ghosts. After he has made the fourth

circuit he slowly disappears in the ditch near the fire. The people try 
to hold him by the rope, but a[)pareutly he sinks out of reach. Then 
many voices are heard coming from out of the tire — actually the voices 
of people hidden in the bedrooms who speak through the kelp tubes. It 
is announced that the ghosts have taken the dancer away, who will 
return alter a certain number of days. When the time of his return is 
at hand, another dance is held. A 
carving representing a ghost is seen 
to rise from out of the ground car- 
rying the dancer. 

SONG OP THE GHOST DANCER.' 

1. I went down to the under world with 

the chief of the ghosts. Therefore I 
have snperiiatiiral power. 

2. The chief of the ghosts made lue dance. 

Therefore I have supernatural power. 

3. He put a heautifiil ornament on to my 

forehead. Therefore I have super- 
natural power. 



The ghost dancer of the La'La- 
siqoala wears a head ring set with 
four feathers and a thick veil of 
ce<lar bark falling over his face 
(tig. 148, p. 501). 

I have two of his songs :

MA'TEM. 

I have told the legend of the Mfi'tEm in the preceding chapter.- The 
dancer, when his song is sung, appears tirst on the roof of the house, 
perfectly naked. Five pieces of wood, which are covered with mica 
and cut in the form of hexagonal prisms in the shape of quartz crytals, 
are fastened along the medial line of his head. They are attached to 
a thin wooden frame, which is shaped according to the curvature of the 
head and hidden in the hair. The frame consists of a medial piece 
which is attached to a ring and held by two crosspieces. All of these 



' Appendix, page 714.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



are given their proper shape by means of steaming'. As the song pro- 
ceeds, the dancer jumps down from the roof to the top of the bedrooms 
in the rear of the house, and from there to the Hoor. He holds his 
hands close to the back of his thighs and runs with short steps around 
the fire. 

Here is a song of Ma'tEm. 

1. I was takeu to tlie foot of the ([luirtz iiioiiiitain. 

2. I was taken to the foot of tlie iiiomitain from where the quartz came rolling down 

to me. 

3. It Hew with me and took me to the end of the world, the cloud, the child of Ma'tEm. 

The following song of the clan Ts'e'- 
ts'eLOiilaqame, the origin of Avhich is 
derived from a tradition, is said to refer 
partly to Ma'tEm, although the connec- 
tion has not become clear to me. 

1. I will tell abont olden times. Long ago 
Wiua'lag'ilis took me to see the thing upon 
which he was blowing water. 

2. Therefore I tell with a loud voice: Long ago 
Wina'lag'ilis took me to see the thing upon 
which he was blowing water. 

NA'XNAK-AQEML AND ME'ILA. 

Two dances derive their origin from 
the heavens, — the Na'xnak'aqEmL and 
Me'iLa. I have already told the legend 
of both (p. 413). The Me'iLa dance and 
the ornaments of the dancer are sliown 
in riate 38 and fig. 141) (p. 501). His club 
(kuc'xayu), the gift which he received 
in heaven, represents the si'siuL. His 
cedar bark ornament is niade of red and 
wliite cedar bark. The large flat attach- 
ments in front represent the Tleiades. 
He carries in place of a rattle a small 
clapper (fig. 150, p. 50L>). 
The Na'xnak-aqEmL wears an immense nnisk, the mouth of which is 
made so that it can o])eu wide. Therefore it is also called ha'x-ila(iam 
(the yawning face). The opening mouth means that the day is yawning 
when the dawn appears. A mask of this kind was among the collec- 
tions at the World's Columbian Exposition, and has been transferred 
to tlie Field Columbian Museum. The song belonging to this mask is 
as follows:^ 

1. You will arise, you who you are known all through the world. 

2. You will arise, you who you are famous all through the world. 

3. You will arise; before you sinks down your rival. 

4. It is said that I buy food for my feast even from my rival.

SECOND HEAD RING OF NENALAATS'EQA. 

Koskinio. 

Cat. No. 175498, U. S. N. M. Collected by F. Boas. 



The opening phrase of this sono- means that the dancer for whom the 
words of this song were modified had taken the pUice of her deceased 
brother, who, therefore, in her had resurrected. 

Finally, I will describe the dances instituted by Wina'lag'ilis, namely 
the ma/maq'a, t'o'X'uit, liawI'nalaL, and a^'mlala. All of tliese wear 
ornaments of hemlock; no red 
cedar bark. They are all con- 
sidered war dances. 

ma'maq'a. 

The ma/maq'a, or thrower, per- 
forms a dance in which he is sn\)- 
posed to throw disease into the 
people. He enters the house naked 
except for a head ring, neck ring, 
waistband, bracelets, and anklets of 
hemlock. His hands are laid flat 
to his haunches. Thus he runs with 
short, quick steps around the fire, 
looking upward with sudden move- 
ments of his head, first to the right, 
then to the left. When doing so, 
he is looking for his supernatural power to come to him. All of a 
sudden he claps his hands together and holds the palms flat one to 
the other. Thus he moves his hands somewhat like a swimmer, up 
an<l then in a long circle forward, downward, and, drawing them close 
to his body, up again. Now he is holding his supernatural power, "the 

worm of the mfi'maq'a," be- 
tween his palms. During all 
this time he is continuing his 
circuit in short, quick steps, 
but he no longer looks up- 
ward, (iraduallyhe takes his 
palms apart, and between them 
is seen the " ma'maq'a's worm." 
This is either a small carved 
si'siuL, or snake, or it is a stick 
which is covered with bark. 
The stick consists of several 
tubes which fit into each other, 
so that thedancercan lengthen 
and shorten it. While the worm is thus seen to increase and decrease in 
size, the mfi/maq'a resumes his motions of throwing, moving the closed 
palms in circles, as described above. Suddenly he seems to throw the 
implement which he is holding. At once all the people stoop and hide 
under their blankets. Tlie implement has disappeared. He repeats 
the performance. The second time when he throws the worm, it is

seen to fly in the air. Actually there is a second one of the same 
shape as the implement that was seen in the ma'maq'a's hands. This 
is attached to a long string, which is stretched across the rear of the 
house where the seal society are sitting. Two men are holding the 
string, one on each side of the house, and hidden in the bedrooms. Uy 
pulling the rope and tightening and slackening it the worm is seen to 

tly up and down and from the right to 
the left. While it is Hying there tiie 
ma'raaq'a moves to the right and to the 
left in front of it, his hands stretched 
forward, the palms upward, the elbows 
to the side, always moving with short, 
quick steps. Finally the flying worm 
disappears and the ma'raaq'a catches 
it again. Then he resumes his motions 
of throwing and finally seems to throw 
it into himself. He almost collapses, 
and tries to rid himself of the disease- 
bringing object by vomiting. Blood is 
seen to flow from his month and down 
his whole body. This is sometimes pro- 
cured by biting the inside of the cheek or by breaking a small bladder 
containing blood which the dancer holds in his mouth. After pro- 
longed efforts he vomits the worm. At once he is hale and well and 
proceeds in his dance. Now he throws the fourth time. The worm tiies 
into some of the people, who at once jump up and rush toward the Are, 
where they fall down lifeless. 
THood is streaming out of their 
mouths. The ma'maci'a con- 
tinues to dance around them, 
blows upon them until finally 
they are carried away like 
dead. The ma'maq'a follows 
them and either he or the 
shaman restores them to life. 
During all this ceremony the 
singers beat the boards rai)idly 
and silently, only stopping 
when the ma/maq'a does not 
dance. His song is sung after 
he has finished his dance. At the close t)f the dancing season the 
ma'nuKi'a indemnifies his victims by the payment of a few blankets. 

Sometimes instead of throwing the disease, he throws a harpoon head. 
There are also two of these used in the ceremony. One is held and 
shown by the ma/maq'a. It is a real point of a^ sealing harpoon. The 
other has no blade, but is provided with two hooks to hook it to the

skiu. The person with whom the ma'maq'a has an understanding, 
hooks this second harpoon head to his skin and opens at the same time 
a small bag containing blood, which seems to flow from tlie wound. 
Later on the ma'maq'a pulls it out and exchanges it quickly for his own 
harpoon head. 

There are still other performances of the ma/maq'a, one of which 
consists in throwing a number of ducks into a kettle that is filled with 
water. I am told that wooden carved ducks are tied to the bottom of 
the kettle and released by a helper as vsoon as the ma'maq'a throws.

1. (io and look every wlieio for his supernaturul power, for his supernatural power. 

Among the La'Lasiqoala the ma'maq'a wears cedar bark ornaments 
as shown in figures 151, 152, pp. 502, 503. His dance is the same as that 
of the Kwakiutl ma'maq'a. Following is one of their ma'maq'a songs :^ 

1. Behold his great supernatural power ; iii. 

2. Bo careful in swinging your sacred implement. 

3. Truly it kills the people, so that they have no time to escape. 

4. Truly the supernatural power cuts short their lives. 

t'o'x'uit. 

The t'o'X'uit is almost always danced by women. The dancer is 
decorated in the same way as the ma'maq'a. She enters singing the 
t'o'X'uit cry: 



■ p 1— <g — g— f-|^-

She holds her elbows close to her sides, the forearms forward, i^alms 
upward. She walks around the fire limping, raising both hands 
slightly with every second step, as though she was trying to conjure 
something up from underground. She is followed by four attendants. 
Her spirit is in most cases the sI'siuL, and him she is conjuring. She 
moves around the fire four times, and now the ground opens in the rear 
of the house and out comes a huge si'siuL, Its horns are moving and 
its tongues are playing. This carving is either raised by means of 
strings which pass over the beams of the house or by men who lift it 
from underneath. A carving of this sort was exhibited at the World's 
Columbian Exposition, and has been transferred to the Field Columbian 
Museum. As soon as it appears there is a great commotion in the lear 
of the house so that it can not be seen very distinctly. After it has 
disappeared again the singers begin its song, which is as follows: ^ 

1. Let us show what we gained by war! 

2. (Winfi'lag'ilis says:) 1 did not turn my face backward to look at those who were 

bothering me when I went to make war on you, friend.

3. Throw your power that is killing everybody, throw your fire of death, throw what 

makes them turn their faces downward, throw it against them who went to 
make war upon you. 

4. I surpass them, they arc the lowest of the whole world. 

5. I pulled them iuto my canoe to he my slaves, that they may bail out the war canoe.' 

Another t'o'X'uit will take 
a stick, a lauce, or a paddle, 
and, after Laviiii;' conjured up 
the sI'siuL, split it in two. 
This is done with a smaller 
carving, which consists of two 
l)arts that can be separated 
and joined again by means of 
strings. A si'siuL of this kind 
was collected by Mr. Hunt for the 
Anthropological Department of the 
World's Columbian Exposition, and 
is now in the Field Columbian IVEu- 
seum. Its song, which is four gen- 
erations old, is as follows:^ 

1. I have been on the other side of the 

world, I, the great supernatural 

being. 
There I obtained all the supernatural 

power. 
T bring with me all the 8U]iernatural 

power. 

Still other t'o'X'uit will conjure up 
a small sT'siuL, which Hies through 
the air like that of the ma'maq'a. 
At other times the t'o'X'uit will suc- 
ceed in bringing the sI'siuL npjust 
far enough for its horns to show. 
She tries to grasp it and it takes her 
down to the nnder world. Then her 
friends try to hold her, but she dis- 
appears. Her attendant, who holds 
on to her, sinks into the ground 
with his forearms and seems to

'This song is a modified form of an older song belonging to the Sl'sinLac of the 
Kwakiutl. It was given this form at a time when the Nimkish bad invited the 
Kwakiutl to a feast. It is aimed against the Nimkish. The references to war mean 
here only the rivalry in distril>utions of property, and the song intimates that the 
Kwakiutl are superior to the Nimkish. The dancer is called "friend" because when 
the song was sung first he had not received his new name yet. In line 3, "makes 
them turn their faces downw.ard," means that the Nimkish are lying flat on the 
ground and the Kwakiutl are stepping over their backs. Line 4, "the lowest of the 
whole world," me;nis again the Nimkish, exaggerating tlieir inferiority.

be carried all throagli the house by the woman who is moving under- 
ground. He is plowing the floor with his arms. This is done by bury- 
ing a stout ro[)e about S in(;hes below the surface and covering it with 
loose dirt. The man pulls himself along this rope (see p. G()4). 

Still other t'o'X'uit invite the people to kill them. The dancer says 
"hu]>, hap," moving the edge of her palm along her throat, meaning, 
''Cut my neck!" or she moves the tips of the fingers of both hands 
down her stomach, meaning "Open my belly!" or she moves them 
along her head, shoulders, or other parts of her body. Finally, she is 
l)]aced on a seat behind the fire and one of her attendants complies 
with her request. He will appear to drive a wedge through her head 
from one temple to the other. The wedge is first shown to the people 
and then secretly exchanged for another one, which consists of two 
parts attached to a wooden band that is slipped over her head and 
covered with hair. Tlius it seems that the butt is standing out on one

side, the point having passed through her skull. At the same time 
bladders containing blood, which are attached to the band, are burst, 
and the blood is seen to flow down her face. She also bites her cheeks 
or bursts a small bag containing blood which she holds in her mouth, 
■ so that it flows out of her mouth. A i)air of seal's eyes are hidden in 
her hair and let down over her own eyes when the wedge is driven in, 
so that it looks as though her eyes were coming out of their sockets. 
Then she rises and walks around the fire to show the wedge sticking in 
her head. After one circuit she is seated again, the wedge is removed, 
and she is hale and sound. On other occasions the head or shoulder 
is struck with a paddle which seems to split it, and on being with- 
drawn leaves a bloody line, which looks like a wound. In this case the 
paddle is secretly exchanged for another one which is so notched as to 
fit her head or shoulder. Slie walks around the tire showing it, and 
then it is removed. 

Other t'o'X'uit rec^uest their attendants to kill them with a spear.

blood is seen to flow from the wound. The blood is in this case also 
kei)t in a small bladder, which is attached to the sl<in. When it seems

to have entered the full breadth of the body, the skin on the opposite 
side is seen to be pushed out by the point, and blood flows also from 
that point. As a matter of fact, a hook which is attached to the hem- 
lock ring on the dancer's arm is fastened to the skin, which is pulled up 
by a slow motion of the arm. At the same time the hook breaks a 
bladder containing blood.

Ill some (lances the bead of the dancer is cut off, and the person who 
cuts it shows a carved human head bearing the expression of death, 
which he holds by its hair. These heads are as nearly portraits of the 
dancer as the art of the carver will permit 
(tigs. 153, 154, pp. 503, 501). 

Sometimes the t'o'X'uit is burnt. A 
box which has a double bottom is i)re- 
pared for this performance. The dancer 
lies down flat in the rear of the house and 
tlie box is laid down sideways, so that 
she may be pushed into it from behind. 
At the place where she is lying down a 
pit is dug, in which she hides, while being 
concealed from the view of the people by 
the box which stands in front of her. After the pit has been covered 
again, the box is raised, closed, and thrown into the fire. Before the 
box is brought in, a skeleton has been put between its two bottoms. 
^Vhile the box is burning, the song of the dancer is heard coming from 
the fire. From the pit in which she hides a speaking tube of kelp is laid 
under the fioor to the fireplace, and through it she sings. When the fire 
has died doAvn, the charred bones are found in the ashes. They are col- 
lected, laid on a new mat, and for 
four days the people sing oA^er 
them. The mat is so placed that 
it lies over the mouth of another 
speaking tube. Tlie shaman tries 
to resuscitate her, and after four 
days a voice is heard coming forth 
from the bones. Then they are 
covered with a mat. The woman 
crawls up from out of a ditch, 
into which the bones are thrown, 
while she lies down in their place. 
She begins to move, and when 
the mat is removed, she is seen 
to have returned to life. In 
many of these dances, after the 
performer has been killed, tlie 
d'E'ntsiq (Plate 39 and fig. 155)-' 
arises from under ground. It 
consists of a series of flat, carved 
^- ""•"'• boards connected on their nar- 

row sides by plugs which pass through rings of sin-uce root or through 
tubes cut out of cedar. The joiuts are somewhat loose, so that the whole 
can be given an undulating motion forward and backward. It has two

or three points on top, and mica is glued on its painting. It is intended 
to rei)resent tlie sI'siiiL, but I am not able to interpret the carving in 
detail. The characteristic figure of the sI'siuL certainly does not appear 
on it. 

Other t'o'X'uit, instead of conjuring the al'siuL, bring up the nd'n- 
LKmg-ila (making foolisli) (tigs. 156-158),' a small human figure with 
movable head and arms. It dances about, and then one or two birds 
are seen to lly down from the roof and alight on its head. In fig. 
158 the bird is seen sitting on the figure's head. Fig. 159 rei)resents 
a bird which is let down by means of strings, at the same time flapping 
its leather wings. Often the bird takes hold of the figure's head and 
carries it away, to return it after a wliile. The face of the no'nLEmg-ila 
is always painted in the same manner. It is white, and two black lines, 
on to which mica is glued, run downward from the eyes. The head is 
^et witli tufts of human hair. Tlie figure is also worked from under- 
ground. In some dances only the head of the no'uLEmg'ila is used 

(fig. IGO, p. 510). It is worn by a 
dancer who wraps a blanket over his 
head and carries the head in front of 
liis stomach.

able to make every object he touches

The La'Lasi(xoala call the t'o'X'uit o'lala, and have special names for

ing from the woods, has many bloody lines on his cheek, "the rubbing 
of Wlna'lag'ilis's canoe." Four horizontal lines run over each cheek, 
nearly reaching the nose. Above them is one just under the eyes cross- 
ing the bridge of the nose, and two short vertical lines run down the 
temples outside the eyes. Another painting of the o'lala consists of 
one pair of parallel black lines running from one cheek over tlie upper 
part of the bridge of the nose to the other cheek, and of a pair running 
horizontally across the middle of the forehead. Following is one of the 
o'lala's songs :^ 

1. (O'lala sings:) The world knows that I have rpaclied the dancing pole of our 

world. 

2. (The jieople sing:) Hold upright the great post in the middle of the world. 

3. You who holds up the world. 

4. You keep the sky from falling down like a foundation built of 

interlocking logs.

parallel short black lines. There are five such groups of vertical lines 
distributed irregularly over each cheek. Three longer lines occupy the

nose. Three more lines occupy the chin — one running from the middle

up so that it grows out of his mouth like the tail of a snake. His orna- 
ments are shown in fig. 163 (p. 511). Following is his song:' 

The people sing : How great is our famous one ! 
How great is his name ! 
The dreaded spirit is coming in his canoe ! 
How great is his name ! 
Si'lls sings: Do not be troubled! Do not be afraid on account of the storm 

caused by my great protector. 
My protector the si'siuL goes right up to the greatest chiefs. 
The people sing: How great is our famous one! 
Si'lls sings: He said to me: "You will take counsel with Wina'lag-ilis. 

He said to me: "You will be friend to Wlufi'lag-ills. 
The people sing: How great is our famous one. 

The A"mlala is also initiated by Wina'lag-ilis. He is not counted as 
a member of the t'o'X'uit, but performs a separate dance. His head 
ring and neck ring are made of hemlock. He wears a club, the end of 
which is set with long thorn.s (fig. 164, p. 512). After several circuits 
around the fire, he presses these thorns into his head, and blood is seen

to flow freely. Tlien lie presses them into his neck. His rings are made 
ot lieniloc-k branches, in which a tube of kel])is hidden. The tube is filled 
\\ith blood. The thorns are pushed into 
the kelp, out of which the blood runs over 
the face and down the body. 

The last of the dances, the origin of 
which is ascribed to WTna/lag-ilis, is the 
liawI'nalaL, the war dance. The legend 
of this dance belongs to the clan Maam'- 
tag-ila. In the beginning of the world 
there was a man named Wl'naXwTna- 
g-im, who was a great warrior. He wanted 
to go on war expeditions all the time. 
The })eople who desired to have peace 
tied him with strong ropes. He, how- 
ever, broke them without difficulty. He 
held a knife in his hands, the handle of 
which represented the si'siuL, and ran 
out of the house, and killed everybody 
who set his foot on the street. The blood 
ran in streams down to the water. The 
people tinally took hold of him again, cut 
holes through his thighs and through his back, and pulled ropes through 
them. Thus they hung him onto the beam of the house and began to 
sing songs which they hoped would appease him. While he was swing- 
ing from the beam he still held his knife, and as he could not cut any- 
one else, he cut his own head. His wounds did not hurt him; on the

contrary, he enjoyed them. After a while he became quiet. Then they 
took him down. Later on, whenever he came back from war, he asked 
the people to pull ropes through his back and to haul him up to the roof.

They tied to liis back a sT'siuL carving to wliich ropes were fastened, 

stietclied a heavy rope from the beach to tlie roof of his house, and 

[)nlled him up. They carried him around 

the roof and let him down again. 
The performance of the hawI'nahiL is 

a rei)etition of the deeds of this man. 

Wlien he is being initiated, he fasts in 

the woods until he grows very thin. 

When he comes back, he wears orna- 
ments of hemlock branches. Small thin 

slabs of wood carved in the shape of 

paddles (fig. 1G5, p. 513) are sewed along 

his arms and legs, across his chest, and 

down his sides. Then a rope of red cedar 

bark is stretched from the roof of the 

dancing house to the beach. Nobody is 

allowed to go under it, and no canoe must 

pass in front of it. If a canoe shonld 

transgress this law, it is seized, carried 

into the house, and slung to the beams, 

where it remains for four days. When 

he liawI'nalaL dances in the liouse, his legs and his back are cut audt 

ropes pulled througli the holes, Avhich are lield by two men. The paint- 
ing on a bedroom (Plates 40,41) shows 
this very well. The hawI'nalaL pulls on 
the strings as hard as possible, so that his 
flesh is pulled far out. He stretches his 
arms backward, crying "ai, ai!" which 
means tliat he desires his leader to pull 
on the ropes. Then he looks upward and 
points up with his first fingers, crying 
''ai, ai!" which means, "Hang me to the 
beam!" He carries a belt or neck ring 
carved in the form of the sI'siuL. Fig. 
1(»0, ]). 514, shows a neck ring of this kind, 
wliich is jointed and hinged with leather 
so that it can be hung around the neck. 
A string runs along the opening sides of 
the joints. Wh.en it is pulled, the neck 
ring straightens and is used by the hawl'- 
nalaL as a sword or lance to hurt himself. 
The belt of the hawi'nalaL has si'siuL 
heads (fig. 1G7, p. 514). His knife, which 

he carries in his hand ((I'E'Layu), shows the same design (figs. 168, 

1G9, p. 515). Wliile the hawi'nalaL is making his circuits, moving his 

hands, and crying as described above, and making high steps, lie cuts

his head with his knife, aud finally with a sudden jerk tears his flesh so 
that the ropes drop down. Then he disappears in his room in the rear 
of the house. At other times ropes are passed through his back and 
thighs and he is pulled up 
to the beams hanging by the 
ropes. He carries his knife 
and cuts his head while being 
suspended there. As soon as 
he is being hauled up, the nod'n- 
LEmaLa take their lances and 
crowd under the place where 
he is hanging, holding thepoints 
of their lances upward, so that 
he would drop right on to them 
if the ropes should give way. 
The bears stand around wait- 
ing to tear him if he should fall, 
and the ha/mats'as squat near by, becau.se they are to eat him if he 
should fall upon the lances of the noo'nLEmaLa. 
Here is a song of the hawi'nalaL : 

1. They tried to hang me and to kill rae in war. 

2. But the water where the"y tried to kill me only turned into curdled blood. 

I also give (figs. 170, 171, p. 51G) the mask of the eartlKpiake dancer 
(Xoa'exoe). He wears a rattle consisting of a ring on which perforated 
shells are strung (tig, 172, p. 51G). His dance is believed to shake the 

ground and to be a certain means of 
bringing back the ha/mats'a who is 
being initiated. 

I will add here a song of a mask 
in regard to which I have not been 
able to obtain any definite informa- 
tion. It is called Uai'alik-imL and 
belonged originally to theG-e'xsEm 
of the Kaqo'mg'ilisala, whose ances- 
tor, He'lig'ilig-ala, it is said to rep- 
resent. The dancer is initiated in 
the house. In his first and third 
dances he wears ornaments of red 
cedar bark which have a horn on 
each side, one behind, and a fiat crosspiece in front. In his second and 
fourth dances he wears a curious mask. 
After the mask has disappeared, the people sing: ^ 

1. Everybody goes to him to obtain dances. 

2. In the beginning the never stopping one spread his wings over your head. '^

It may be that the following soug belongs to the same mask: ^ 

1. Aiabaia! Sing Haialik'alaL, sing winter dance songs, great superniitural spirit! 

2. Aia haia! Then the people will ask you to fulfill their desires, great siiperuatural 

spirit. 
.3. Aia haia! Then they will take the cedar bark ornaments out of your hair, great 

supernatural spirit. 
4. Aia haia! Then they will ask you to give them plenty to eat, great supernatural 

spirit. 

The dance Hai'alik-auae of the various tribes belongs here, but I have 
not been able to collect any of the songs belonging to it. Figs. 173-177 
(pp. 517-520) show the ornaments of the Kwakiutl dancer; figs. 178- 
180 (pp. 521-523), the ornaments of Hai'alik-auae of the Mmkish; and 
fig. 181, p. 5 -4, the L'a'sq'enox. 

The ring of the shaman (fig. 182) is figured on page 525. 

The La'Lasiqoala embrace all those who are for the first time initiated 
as winter dancers in one group, who are called wa'tanEm, the lowest 
grade of the winter dance societies. Their head ring is shown in fig. 
383 (p. 525). 

The same type of ring, but somewhat larger, is used by the chief of 
the killer whale society of the Kwakiutl (fig. 184, p. 526). 

Following is a wa'tanEm song:^ 

1. You do not go into Wina'lagilis' canoe, you wIk) are known everywhere. 

2. You do not go into Wma'lag'ilis' canoe, you whose name is known everywhere. 

3. You, who will be feared by all the supernatural beings 

4. You, great one, who will be feared by all the supernatural beings. 

The head ring worn by the que'qutsa is shown in fig. 185 (!>. 527). 
When a person is to be initiated for the first time, he receives among 
the Kwakiutl the rings shown in figs. 18G, 187 (pp. 527, 528). 

It remains to give a list of the dances according to their rank. There 
are many among them, about which I have no further information than 
that contained in the following list. I also give the number of songs 
which belong to each dancer, his whistles, and secret songs, which are 
sung by the dancer himself. This order has reference, of course, only 
to the Kwakiutl proper: 

1. Awi'loLlaL, four songs; four whistles; secret song. Hemlock rings. (Dancers 

who have acquired lui'mats'a, liai'alik-ilaL, t'6'X'uit.)

500 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The Ts'a/watEeiiox, Guau'aenox, HaxuiVmis, T'Eiia'xtax, and A'wai- 
LEla have the followiug order so far as I have been able to learn : 

1. Mfi'maq'a. 

2. Ilfi'mats'a. 

3. Hai'aq'antElaL (speaker clauce). 

4. Hawr/xaqulaL, who iuducea chiefs to destroy property, coppers, etc. 

5. Walas'axil'aL. 

6. HauiViadalaL (a fool dance). 

Among the Koskimo, G-o'p'enox, L'a'sq'enox, and Gua'ts'enox the 
t'o'X'uit is first in rank. Next is the ma'maq'a, and then follows the 
hiVmats'a. 

The La'Lasiqoala, Naqo'mg-ilisala, NjVqoaqtoq, and (lou-i'hi do not 
inclnde all the dances enumerated above in the winter ceremonial 
(ts'e'ts'aeqa). A large number, particularly the fool dancers, the hawi'- 
nalaL, and all the animals, are included in a ceremonial called no'nLEm, 
which is neither ba'xus (secnlar or profane) nor sacred. Songs belonging 
to both seasons are used in this ceremonial. I shall discuss tliis cere- 
monial more fully later on (Chapter XII, p. 621). The number of mem- 
bers of the ts'e'ts'aeqa is consequently small. They are arranged in 
the following order, beginning with the highest: 

1. Ma'maq'a. 

2. HiVinata'a. 

3. Ha'mtSEtsoe. This is a hfi/inats'a who is not taken away by BaxbakualanuXsi' waO, 

but only dreams of him. Consequently his initiation is performed in the 
house. He has neither the ha/mats'a cry (hap) nor the ha'mshamtsKs cry 
(h wip). His song has words only. His badges are like those of the ha'mats'a. 

4. Ts'e'kois. 

5. Ts'e'koa'ta. 

6. H"ai'alik"auae. 

7. O'lala (corresponding to the t'o'X'ult). 

8. Lolo'i.iilaL. 

9. YiaiatalaL, or Q'o'minoqisaL. 

10. Pa'xalalaL, shaman dance. 

11. Wa'tauEm. These are the novices who have just entered the ts'f-'ts'ar'qa. After 

the ha'mats'a has been initiated four times he is wa'tauEm — that jneans, 
pulled ont of the dancing house. He becomes a ({ue'cintsa. During this 
transitional period he is waLawe, 1. e., wa'tauEm in a transitional stage. When 
a ba'xus offends the q'a'q'anas, which include the above dancers, he is made 
wa'tanEm. He dances in four houses and becomes a novice. The following 
year he will be initiated in one of the higher societies. 



IX. The Winter Ceremonial of the Kwakiutl. 

I can now proceed to describe the ceremonial at wiiich all these 
dancers perform their ceremonies. Generally it is connected with the 
refund of the purchase money for a wife, the qaute'x-a, as described on 
page 421. 

I will describe first the great ceremonial which is the same for all tlie 
laxsa, but most elaborate for the initiation of a ha'mats'a. The whole

ceremonial is in charge of a master of ceremonies, whose name is 
IJii'xnemis and LE'mwala, while his profane name is O'mx-'it; the win- 
ter name of his speaker is Ho'LElite. A number of further officers 
will be described in the course of this chap- 
ter. All these officers and the names of the 
officers derive their origin from a myth telling 
how the animals held their first winter cere- 
monial. I shall relate the myth later on (page 
538). Plate 42 represents the present master 
of ceremonies and his speaker. 

At the time of marriage the bride's father 
has promised to transfer his membershiii in 
one of the secret societies to one of his son- 
in-law's children. When a son of the latter 
has reached tlie age of 10 or 13 years, or even 
earlier, he is initiated in one of the lower 
secret societies, through which he must 

pass before he 
can become a 
m e m b e r (if 
the hri/mats'a 

society. As soon as he is entitled to 
1PI\WI U yi become a member of this society, his 

||i|fM: fo y\ father invites the three principal chiefs 

tVwfgj Mm of the tribe to his house and informs 

them that he desires his father-in-law 
to make his son a member of the secret 
society. The celebration of this event 
is exceedingly expensive, and for this 
reason the three chiefs investigate the 
debts and the property of the man and 
of his father-in-law, in or<ler to make 
sure that they can meet the expenses in- 
cidental to the ceremonies. If they find 
the amount of property sufficient, they 
give permission for the celebration of 
the festival. In this case they order the 
father to invite all the chiefs of the tribe 
to meet on the fourth day. When they 
assemble, the three head chiefs inform 
the young chiefs of the plan, and the 
latter give their consent. 

At this meeting, the man who gives 
the dance notifies his father-in-law that he desires to have the blankets 
which he paid for his wife returned, and that he wants to have the box- 
containing his father-in-law's dance.

Then the chiefs order the man to invite the whole tribe to a meeting 
which is to be held four days later. The three head chiefs inform the 
tribe, in a speech made in a low voice, of their intention to hold a winter 
dance, and the young chiefs request all to prepare themselves for this 
festival. In particular, they are asked to clean themselves, and to 
refrain from intercourse with women, as the spirit WTna'lag'ilis, who has 
his home in the north, but dwells among the Indians during the dancing- 
season, dislikes people who are unclean, or such as have had inter- 
course with women. The young man who is going to give the winter 

ceremonial is called the ye'- 
wix'ila. 

At this meeting, the father- 
in-law calls one of his sj)eak- 
ers, who must step into the 
middle of the house, holding a 
pole, which is from 6 to 8 feet 
long. It is called the winter- 
dance pole. 
The sjDeaker delivers a 
speech, in which he sets forth the amount of property represented by 
the pole, and announces the intention of the father in-law to give it to 
the young man. He asks the latter to step up to the pole and touch it, 
as a sign of acceptance. The whole assembly join in this demand, and 
the young man, accompanied by a chief — who is paid for this service 
later on — steps up to the pole. The chief who speaks for the young 
man asks the father-in-law what the pole represents, and the latter's 
speaker sets forth once more the amount of property, such as blankets, 
copper bracelets, food, and grease, which is to be used in the dance.

Then the chief representing the young man takes the pole, lays it over 
his shoulder, and runs around the fire, stooping and crying, " Whoo! 
whoo! whoo!" The meaning of this action is that the weight of the 
property represented by the pole is too heavy for him to carry. Then 
he sings the following song:' 

The Spirit of the Winter Dance came dovrn, 

The Spirit of the Winter Dance came down and stays here with me. 

Then the master of the ceremonies rises and orders everyone to 
bathe early in the morning for four days before the crows begin to cry,

and thus to prepare to meet Wina'lag-ilis. At this time the winter- 
dance whistles are heard for the first time. These whistles represent 
the voices of the spirits of the winter dance. When first heard, they 
appear to be far away from the house in a northerly direction. The 

second time they come nearer the 
house, and thus they are heard four 
times, nearer and nearer. This in- 
dicates that the spirit approaches 
the village from the north. Finally, 
the whistles of the spirit of the 
cannibal society are heard near the 
house. Then the sound is heard on 
the roof and moves around it four 
limes. At this time the son of the 
num who gives the festival suddenly 
disappears (x-is'e/t), and a few min- 
utes later he is heard to cry in the 
woods "bap, hap, hap," the sound 
which is ascribed to the cannibal 
spirit BaxbakualanuXsrwae. The 
master of ceremonies asks the people 
if they know the meaning of all this, 
and another chief replies that Bax- 
bakualanuXsi'war' has taken the 
young man to his house to initiate him in the cannibal ceremonies. To 
this the master of ceremonies replies that after four days the people 
are to assemble again, to receive the orna- 
ments of cedar bark. He asks them to sing 
their summer songs during this time, to use 
their summer names, and to make merry, be- 
cause as soon as the four days are over they 
will be forbidden to use their summer names 
and to sing their summer songs. On the fol- 
lowing morning when the crows begin to cry, 
everybody, young and old, takes a bath in 
the sea. They rub their bodies with hemlock 
branches, in order to clean themselves jjrepara- 
tory to the advent of the spirit Wlnri'lag-ilis. 
On the evening of the third day the master 
of ceremonies distributes plain head ornam.ents 
and neck rings of cedar bark among twelve 
messengers, who must blacken their faces and 
go to the houses of the people in order to 
invite them to the meeting to be held the 
following day. They receive in payment a button blanket from the 
master of ceremonies, which is not returned. Their offices are not 
hereditary. Persons who have good voices are selected to act as 
messengers. They carry in their hands staffs about 8 feet long.

When tliey come to a house, they open the (h^or uiid iuvite the people, 
the woDieii first, one of the inmates of tlie house prompting the 
speaker. When they call the names, they stand in the door and strike 
the threshold with their staffs." After the women, the hri'mats'a is 
called, and then the other men, the que'quts'a last. Then the speaker 
of these twelve men says,^ " Is that all ?" The people reply,'' " That is 
all." Then they call a certain relative of the master of ceremonies who 
has the name Ts'ix'ii'xtolsE'las.'' All the property given away by the 
master of ceremonies is given in honor of this relative, who consequently 
is of high rank. He or she receives this name anew every year. After 
the messengers have called the peoi)le by their winter names, they are 
not allowed to use their summer names again until the ceremonies are 

ended. 

By this time the people begin to ar- 
range themselves in groups, which are 
divided accordingto sex and age. These 
take the place of the clans, as described 
before. 

On the following morning before day- 
light, the same twelve men visit all the 
houses and call to everybody: "Don't 
sleep! Go and bathe in the sea. We 
are walking around again to call you."' 
The people rise and at once plunge into 
the sea, in order to clean themselves for 
the qap'ek" or assembly, which is the for- 
mal beginning of the winter ceremonial. 
Then they go to the house of the mas- 
ter of ceremonies, which is called the assembly house,'' The house has 
been prepared for this purpose. A heavy cedar plank has been laid 
along the rear wall of the house, and another one along each side. 
These are used for beating time. The door is surrounded by a ring of 
hemlock branches which is covered with eagle down, so that everyone 
who steps into the house must pass through it. When passing through 
it, the people turn to the left, step through it with the right foot first, 
and then turn again. 

The members of the seal society^ do not enter the house, but assem- 
ble in another house. During this day the i)eople sing and make merry 
until after dark. Then the master of ceremonies rises and calls four 
officers to go and invite the seal society. These offices are hereditary, 
and the men who perform the ceremonies have certain names which

belong to the offices: X-I'x-iqala, of the Gue/tela tribe; Q'e'q'aqaualas, 
of theWalas Kwakintl tribe; LoxsA/, of the Ha'ialik-auae clan, and 
A'Lu'lsEla, of the Q'o'moyur' tribe. The last is their leader. They are 
called pJi'paxaMif' (head paxalas). One of these men must be a " paxala" 
(shaman). When starting each takes a round rattle. They blacken 
their faces, put on their head rings and neck rings of red cedar bark, 
and cover their heads with eagle down. Then their speaker, A'Lo'lsEla, 
says, "We are going to fetch our friends."^ Then they go around the 
fire four times, singing as follows:^ 

O friend, O friend, O supernatural friend (meaning Winu'lag-ilis). 

Then they go to the house in which the seal society is waiting for 
them. Meanwhile, the master of ceremonies calls up four other officers 
to invite the highest members of the seal society, the ha/mats'as. These 
offices are also hereditary. The names of the officers are: K-tVqauLeE, 
of the Kue'xa tribe; Me/goatExstala, of the same tribe; K-ex-, of the 
Maa'mtag'ila clan; and Na/wulqalag-ilis, of the Kue'xa tribe. The first 
three names are que'qutsa names, the last is a ha'mshamts'ES name. 
He is the leader of these four messengers. They are also called pii'pa- 
xame (head paxala), and there must be one "paxala" (shaman) among 
them. 

The master of ceremonies gives them tallow. The ha'mshamts'ES 
puts some of it into his mouth, chews it, and then rubs it all over his 
face, while the others simply rub it on their faces without chewing. 
Each is also given a cedar bark ring, charcoal, feathers, and a round 
rattle. They all wear quc/qutsa rings. After they have received the 
ornaments, they say, "We will go and fetch our great friends.'" They 
walk four times around the fire, singing:* 

You said, AVlna'lag'ilis, that I should capsize in rough weather. Your friend 
stayed here long in my canoe near the beach. You said that I should capsize in 
rough weather, but your friend capsized sleeping while it was rough weather." 

Then they walk around the fire, go on their errand, and after about 
fifteen minutes the eight men who were sent to fetch the seal society 
and the ha'mat'sas return, and A'Lo'lsEla sings:" 

BaxbakualauuXsi'wad told me about the great supernatural means of killing people 
' with mv teeth.

^This song refers to a man named Eix-'ag-ida'lag-ilis who met Wina/lag*ilis. The 
latter asked him: "Are yon a shaman?" He replied in tlie affirmative, and con- 
tinued: "Can you cross here without up.setting your canoe?" "Yes," retorted 
Winu'lag-ilis. "Then let me see," said the former. "If you succeed, I will cross 
next." When Wlna/lag-ills tried to cross, he capsized. Then Eix-'ag-ida lag-ilis 
sang the above song. A translation is very difficult, and the sense is by no means 
certain.

The four meu who went to fetch the seal society enter first. Those 
who went to fetch the hfi'mats'as follow them. Before they enter, the 
people who are assembled in the house clear their throats, as they are 
not allowed to cough or to laugh after the seal society have entered. 
When the messengers enter, A'Lo'lsEla says, " Our friends are coming.'" 

Now Nfiwulqa'lag-ilis says, "Take care, 
our great friends are coming.'"- 

Tben the four men who called the seals sit 
down in the left-hand front corner of the 
house, the others in the right-hand front 
corner. Now everybody looks at the door 
where the fool dancers (noo'uLEmaLa) enter 
first. They strike the door with their swords 
or lances, open it, and stand in the doorway. 
Tlieir faces are blackened, they wear torn and 
soiled clothing. Tlieir heads are strewed 
with eagle down. If anyone laughs or 
coughs, the fool dancer steps up to him and 
threatens him with his sword or lance. Then 
the fool dancers turn one by oiie, go to the 
right around the fire, and sit down on their 
seats. Their jilaces are at both ends of those 
of the seal society, as they are the guards 
of the society. Then all the other mem- 
bers of the society enter, each group by 
themselves, and each dressed in their proper 
ornaments of red cedar bark. They stand 
in the doorway for a short time, and then 
go to their places, turning to the right and 
going around the fire. The ha/mats'as are 
the last to enter. They are i)receded by the 
grizzly bear dancers, whose faces are black 
ened. They wear blankets, and bear claws 
on their hands. If there happens to be an 
odd number of these, one of their number 
goes to the rear of the house. The others re- 
main at the door and look around among the 
assembly. Then they divide into two parts, 
forming two rows, one on each side of the 
door. Now the ha'mats'as enter and i^ass between the two rows of bear 
dancers, which close behind. The ha'mats'as step up to the fire and, 
standing side by side, face the rear of the house. There they stand for 
about ten minutes, during which time nobody is- allowed to move. 
Then the master of ceremonies rises and makes a speech in a very low 
voice, in which he warns the people to be careful and not to offend 
the ha'mats'as. The latter turn to the right and walk slowly to the rear

of the house, hokliuj;' their blankets in a fold over their arms, which are 
held at some distance from their chest. If any one coughs after the 
ha/mats'as have entered, the bear steps up to him and threatens him. 
The offender must give a feast to the seal society; sometimes also to 
the que/qutsa. The ha'mats'as sit down in the middle of the rear of the 
house. Kext to them on both sides sit the bear dancers; next to these 
the other groups of the seal society. Then 
the master of ceremonies asks the four mes- 
sengers who went to invite the members of the 
lower grades of the seal society to fetch tallow 
and white cedar bark. The four men rise 
together and A'Lo'lsEla says : "We go to lift 
our grandfather from the tloor."' 

All the ceremonial objects which are ac- 
quired by inheritance are called "grand- 
father." They are kept in four boxes in the 
right-hand front corner of the house. When 
the men lift them, tlie ts'a'eiia spirits enter 
them, making them hungry. This is ex- 
pressed in their song, which they sing while 
walking around the fire and carrying the 
boxes containing the tallow and cedar bark:- 

This is what makes ns confused. 

They carry these boxes four times around 
thefire and then stop in front of the ha'mats'as, 
to whom they give some tallow and cedar bark. 
They continue to distribute it, two men going 
tothe right andtwo going to the left until they 
meet at the door. 

Then the master of ceremonies calls the same 
messenger who went to fetch the ha/mats'as: 
"Come, friends, and lift from the floor your 
grandfather."^ 

They rise, walk around the fire four times, 
and, standing close to the door, the sj)eaker 
says, "We are going, friends, to lift our grand- 
father,""' which means in this case the drum. 
Then they turn to the right and walk out of 
the house. After about ten minutes, they 
are heard to return singing, and enter holding 
each one corner of the drum. They sing : ^

Tbey reniaiu standings uear the doorway, then turn to the right and 
go four times around the lire, and put down the drum. As soon as they 
do so, the small (ts'e'tsaeqa) winter danee wliistles are lu'ard to blow. 
The men say, "That is a good sign for us, friends."^ 

The master of ceremonies next calls the four men who called the seal 
society, Siiying, "Come, friends, go and fetch onr batons."^ They do 
not reply, but begin to sing their secret song, going around the fire four 
times and swinging their rattles:^ 

I am the only one who owns the winter dance. 

They walk out of the 
house and continue to sing 
until they come back, car- 
rying the batons on their 
left arms. They go around 
the fire and put the batons 
down in front of the people, 
beginning with the ha'- 
mats'as, and continuing on 
both sides until they reach 
those who sit nearest the 
door. 

Then the master of cere- 
monies calls upon the four 
men who fetched the ha'- 
mats'as, saying, "Come, 
friends, take up our red 
cedar bark here."^ They 
rise, and their speaker re- 
plies in a low voice, "JS^ow 
I Jim going to take up 
this red cedar bark, your great real friend.'''' They all sing together:*' 

BaxbakualanuXsI'wae made iiifc a winter dancer. 

BaxbaknfihinnXsi'war' made mo pure. 

I do not destroy life, I am the life maker." 

Then they walk out singing, and come back singing the same song 
and carrying the red cedar bark under their left arms. They bring it 
in a long bunch, about 12 feet in length and more than a foot thick. 
One man carries it in front, two in the middle, one at the end. They 
carry their rattles in their right hands. On entering, they turn round

to^etlier so that the cedar bark makes a full turn, i><) round tlie fire to 
the right, aud turn again in the rear of the fiie. Thus they go around 
the fire four times. They stop in the right-hand front eorner of the house. 
The master of ceremonies now proceeds to prepare the floor of the 
house for the ceremonies, or "to put the naualak into the floor.'' lie 
gives slow jerks downward with his round rattle, say- 
ing with each movement, "op," and stooping down to 
the floor. This is the song of Hai'alik-auar', the first 
shaman. Thus he goes around the fire once, and then 
he sings his secret song:' 

1. My mind is not strong enough (to lift it). 

2. My mind is ufraid of it.- 

3. I liave seen tlie winter ceremonial. 

After he has finished his song, aSTa/wulqalag'ilis 
stretches his hand backward, and somebody i)uts, 
unnoticed, a knife into it. This he gives to the 
master of ceremonies, who steps up to the four 
men who hold the cedar bark. Three times he pre- 
tends to cut it, and after each cut makes one turn to 
the left. The fourth time he really cuts through it, 
and at the same time the sound of whistles is heard 

proceeding from the ce- 
dar bark. After it is cut, 
the master of ceremo- 
nies distributes it, giv- 
ing the ha'mats'as first 
their part, then to the other members of the 
seal society, and finally to the que'qutsa. 
lie then calls to the men who brought tlie 
members of the seal society, " Bring us our 
down, friends."'' They then bring the 
dishes, each man carrying one dish. Then 
he sends them in the same way to bring 
the tallow. After he has received all the 
dishes, he calls up the four men again and 
sends them to all the people who are as- 
sembled in the house, in order to ask if there is anyone who desires to 
join in the celebration of the winter dance — that is to say, if there is 
another man ready to act as ye'wix-ila during the same ceremonial. 
He asks, "Who is the one to whom the seal society will go?"^

dishes with down. In the rear and in the front of the lire they all 
turn once. Then the master of ceremonies 
returns the dish to the four men and orders 
them to distribute the feathers: "Go and 
feather our great friends."^ 

The men begin again with the ha'mats'a 
and feather the heads of the people, begin- 
ning in the middle and proceeding toward 
both ends. Then they distribute tallow and 
batons in the same way. 

ISow the master of ceremonies puts on his 
head ring, which consists of a flat strip of 
cedar bark, to which a long trail of the same 
material is attached. Again he sings his se- 
cret song and goes around the fire four times 
swinging the rattle, which he holds ai^proxi- 
niately at the height of his head. During 
this song the i)eoi)le bend their heads down 
and move on their seats in order to gain a 
convenient position. They hold their batons 
ready for use. After the master of ceremo- 
nies has gone around the tire four times, he 
stops in front of the ha/mats'as and says 
•'wai, wai," at the same time thrusting his rattle forward. At this 
signal the people look up and begin to beat the boards for about ten 
minutes, during which time the master of ceremonies shakes his rattle.

Then lie swings the rattle in a wide circle, thus giving- a signal for the 
jieople to stop. During the following minutes not a sound is heard 
except from the shamans, who utterfrom time to time the sound "h,h," 
deep from the throat. Tliis means that they are watching to see if the 
people make a mistake or transgress any of the rules. After about ten 
minutes the master of ceremonies gives a new signal for the people to beat 
the boards. After ten minutes more they stop again. Then everyone

begins to sing his own secret song, all at the same time, which is a sign 
that the sx)irit of the winter dance has entered the house. Then all the 
que'qutsa divide according to their societies. 

After this the master of ceremonies gives another signal and all the 
men begin to beat the boards again as hard as possible and at the same 
time the bear dancers utter their cries. The fool dan(;ers are heard to cry 
"wai! hai! hai!" throwing stones and swinging their swords and lances 
at the same time. The master of ceremonies gives a new signal, and 
all the people stop at once beat- 
ing the boards. Then the bear 
dancers and fool dancers look 
down, and all the que'qutsa 
sing again each their own se- 
cret song. When the master 
of ceremonies gives the fourth 
signal for beating the boards, 
the whistles of the ha/mats'as 
are heard in the house. Then 
all the ha'mats'as, bears, and fool dancers rise and drive the people 
before them. While they are doing so they take hold of a child of 
the second ye'wix-ila; the child drops his cedar bark ornaments and 
blankets and disappears in the woods. Then the members of the 
seal society go out of the house followed by the people. Now the 
second ye'wix-ila cleans his house and invites all the people to 
enter. He puts down boards in front of the i)eople and distributes

batons among tliem. At the same time trumpet whistles are heard to 
blow in his bedroom. When the people have assembled iu his house, 
the master of ceremonies says, ''Let us try, friends, to drive aw^ay the 
supernatural being. He has carried away enough of our number.'" 
The people reply, "Come, friend, no one is stronger in 
supernatural power than you are."'^ Then all the other 
men say one after the other, "Let us go on the floor 
and beat time."-' Then they all (men, women, and 
children) get ready to sing the old song which is sup- 
posed to drive the spirits away. They cry "ye lieee 
hu hu hu ye heee!" This is the song of the wolf. 
After this song the master of ceremonies says, "That

ma ma, hamamai." Again he says, "That is wrong." 
The people next utter Hai'alik-auae's sound, "wo ip 
kf wo-ip kf Avo-ip" (kf blown upward). They continue 
this for about live minutes. The whistles continue to 
blow, and the master of ceremonies says again, "That 
is wrong ! That is wrong ! Let us sing another song." 
Now they sing "woi, woi, wdi," which is also Hai'ali- 
k*auae's song. After this song the whistles stop, and 
at the order of the master of ceremonies they sing the 
first sonff of the winter dance :^

Just before the end, the master of ceremonies joins the chorus, crying 
"o hu," and all the people shout " wa!" hitting the boards together, 
which is believed to be a means of driving away the spirits. This song 
is sung four times. Then the speaker of the second ye'wix-ila says: 

"Friends, be hapijy. I received the name from the supernatural

Then all the people reply : " You received your great name from the

3. He will devour them skin aud bones, crushing flesh and bone with his teeth. 

After the song the ye'wix-ila makes another speecli, and promises to 
give a feast early the next morning, saying: " Friends, how beautiful 
have I been made by the supernatural being. I shall give dried 
salmon for all of us and for our women.'" And all reply " wa, wa." 
Early the next morning he calls the people into his house. They take 
their seats, and are first given a meal of dried salmon and grease

In this feast he gives a new name to his relative who had been taken 
away by the ha/raats'a. On the same day the people, who are divided 
according to the societies enumerated above, go to every house, and 
keep on feasting and singing until morning. 

During this time the ha'mats'as are in a state of excitement, and 
occasionally bite some of the people. On the following morning the 




first yt'/wix-ila invites the people to a feast. He sends the Tiiaa'mx'enox 
as his messengers, who dress up and go to every house, where they 
call the women first, then the seal society, and finally the que'qutsa.

They walk through the village, driving the people before them with 
their staffs, until they reach the house of the ye'wix-ila. 

As soon as all the qur^'(iutsa have assembled there, the master of 
ceremonies rises and asks if they are all in the house.- lie sends one

some will say, " They are not all here," referring to the absence of the seal

They rush to the door, but as soon as it opeus the bears aud fool 
dancers come in and prevent them from leaving the house. The people 
ask each other where these people came from,' or, "You ugly thing, 
where did you come from?"^ and try to hit their 
noses with sticks. The bears wear head rings of 
red and white cedar bark. Their faces are painted 
black, showing an enormous mouth set with teeth 
and stretching from ear to ear. They have bear's 
claws on their hands. The 
fool dancers have their faces 
blackened all over. They wear 
red cedar bark. Their cloth- 
ing is ragged and torn. 

Now the ijeople say, "Let 
us drive them out!"-' As 
soon as they try to do so, the 
ha'mats'as jump down from the roof and drive the 
people before them. The bears and fool dancers 
get excited at the same time, and finally drive the 
people out of the house and down to the beach. 
The ha'mats'as, bears, and fool dancers pursue 
them. At last they drive them into the sea and 
keep them standing in the water until they promise 
them the best food they have in their house. Then 
the seal society return to the lo'bEk" or the house of the first ye'wix'- 
ila, while the que'qutsa enter the house of the second ye'wix'ila. 

Here the men take their seats according 
to the societies to which they belong. 
When they are giving a feast here, they 
send four dishes of each course to the 
ha'mats'a. This is called making the 
ha'mats'a eat first.* The food is carried 
to the ha'mats'a by four messengers, who 
are what is called qoe/tse'sta; that means 
people who were seals, and try to become 
que'qutsa. They alone are allowed to 
enter the lo'bEk ". 

The people are not allowed to eat until 
these messengers come back and report that the ha'mats'as have eaten. 
If anybody desires to give a feast, he announces this by calling upon 
one of his children to dance a winter dance, and says, " Come, my

II in any of these speeches a man should use a ba/xus (profane) name 

of a person, all the people cry out at once, and he must sit down. He 

may even be punished by 

the fool dancers. 

The promised feast is 

given in the evening.

people to come to his 

house on the following 

morning. They rise early 

and go in a body from 

house to house calling 

everybody until all the

people), and the people ask him to send them quickly that all may get 

their food, '■* The host sends four of the Koskimo with the food. 

The ha/mats'as will keep these

Koskimo are sent to see what the 
first four are doing, and finally 
they all come back and report that 
the seal society kept them, pre- 
tending that they had stolen part 
of the food which they were sent 
to bring them. The people inquire 
if their master (g'i'g'i), meaning 
the ha/mats'a, has eaten the food

begin to eat also. After the first

meal UDtil they have learned that the ha'mats'as have eaten. For the 
whole dancing season this rule must be adhered to. 

During all this time the father-in-law of the first ye'wix-ila has been 
gathering all his property, principally food, blankets, boxes, dishes, 
spoons, kettles, bracelets, coppers, and box lids, in order to refund 
(qaute/x-a) to his son in-law the amount promised at the marriage of 
his daughter (see p. 4'Jl). 

When he assembles his clan to announce his plans, the members of 
the seal society must not come. This is the only time when the clans 
are recognized during the winter season. He informs the people what 
amount of property he is going to give to his son-in-law, what names he 
is going to have, and how many songs he has had made for him. The 

son-in-law assembles his clan 
in the dancing house (lobEk"), 
and lets them paint their 
faces with charcoal. Mean- 
while the canoe of g'l'sExstala 
is built, as described on p. 
422. All the speakers' staffs 
which are carried at the fes- 
tival are ornamented with red 
cedar bark. The dances that 
are sung all belong to the 
winter dance, only ha'mats'a 
songs are not used. When 
the daughter of the father-iu- 
law dances, she is also dressed 
in cedar bark ornaments. 
The description of the cere- 
monial will be found at the 
place referred to above (p. 
421). 

After the whole amount of 
property has been turned 
over to the son-in-law, the 
father-in-law calls the master 
of ceremonies and, pointing to the l)ox containing the winter dance 
implements — masks, whistles, and ornaments of red cedar bark — he 
says, "Come, I am afraid of this box here; you are the only one who is 
not afraid of it, because you went through the wliole ceremonies of the 
winter dances.' To this the master of ceremonies, who carries a small 
cane, replies, " Let me go there. Yes, your word is good, friends.

It is good that you say I am the highest among you." ' With this he 
lifts the box, hides it under his blanket, and begins to sing his secret 
song, as follows : ^ 

O friend, () friend, O supernatural friend. 

Then he calls the son-in-law, saying, " Stand up; it may be that this 
box is iutended for you."^ The young man rises and replies, ''Hold it 
awhile until I dress up."^ Then he goes to the house, and after a few 
minutes returns without blanket, having his face blackened. He pre- 
sents himself to the master of ceremonies: " Here I am, friend;"^ who 
asks him once more to be ready: '• Gro on, get ready, son-in-law.'"' 
Then he gives him the winter names which belong to the contents of the 
boxes. He receives both the me'emqoat name and also the que'qutsa 
name. He asks him to step near. * The young man turns to the left 
and walks slowly down to the beach where the master of ceremonies is 
standing. The latter takes his neck ring off and, holding it, sings his 
secret song: 

1. My mind is not strong enough (to lift it). 

2. My mind is afraid of it. 

3. I liave seen the winter ceremonial.* 

Then he turns around and gives the young men the neck ring to 
which the arm rings and leg rings are tied. He turns again and takes 
off his head ring. The young man's wife, who stands next to the master 
of ceremonies, gives her dancing apron to tlie latter, who turns once 
and puts it onto her husband. Last of all, he gives him the box. 
Then the master of ceremonies says "hop op" four times. (This is 
the sound of Hai'alik-auae). The master of ceremonies continues:^ 

"Wait a while, son-in-law, you have no name for your k'i'nqalaLala, 

but T have seen what carried away our son. Her name is ." 

With this he secretly puts a whistle into the hand of the son-in-law. 
The latter turns to the right and calls "h! h!" (deep from the throat).

He turns around to the left, stoopiug down, and walks in zigzag" way up 

to the house. Wliei i he approaches 
the house, he cries "liTip! hap!" 
and all the people ot'his clan gather 
the property which has been given 
him aud follow him. As soou as 
he cries "hap hap," his son (the 
g-i'yakila), who is in tlie Moods, is 
heard to reply with the same sound. 
Now, four men of the yc'wix-ila's 
family go down to the s(piare, car- 
rying an ax, and split the box cover 
forming one corner of the square. 
This is called "sinking the canoe" 
(tso'kunsa), and means that the 
son-in-law must distribute among 
the tribe everything he has re- 
ceived from his father-in-law. 
When the people reach the house, the son-in-law gives them some 

food and gives notice that in four days 

he intends to try to bring his son back 

from the woods.' The next three days 

are spent in feasting and dancing. In 

the evening of the third day the young 

man calls all the people to go into the 

woods in order to make eight new songs 

for the ha/mats'a and two for the k-i'n- 

qalaLala, the servant of the ha/mats'a. 

The singing master and his assistants go 

into the w^oods early iu the morning, while 

the maa'mx'enox go in the evening. 

The old chiefs go last, and sit by them- 
selves. They give orders to the que'- 

qutsa, telling them what they have to 

do during the ft^stival when the ha'- 

mats'a is exj^ected to come back. 

While learning the songs the people 

sit promiscuously, not arranged ac- 
cording to the societies to which they 

belong. Those who have good voices sit 

near the singing master. They always 

select a certain clearing in the thicket Fig. 177.

unseen to the songs, as they must dance to tliern when they first appear 
in the house. The people sit arranged in a square. At some distance 
from each corner a fool dancer is placed, to watch that no uninitiated 
I)erson comes near. If, nevertheless, one of these should see what is 
going on he is captured by the fool dancer, taken into the square, and 
he is initiated. 

After all have learned the new songs, they scatter and go home singly 
in order not to attract the attention of the other people. Each family 
takes supper alone, then they get ready for the dance. When it gets 
dark, the ye'wix'ila sends four messengers to invite the people to the 
dance. He gives each of these 
a button blanket, a head ring 
and a neck ring of red cedar 
bark, and eagle down to strew 
on their heads. They walk out 
of the house to one end of the 
village and go into the door of 
the last house, in order to invite 
the people. Each of them has 
a set speech. The first says, 
"Let us try shamans!" The 
second, "We shall try in vain 
to bring back what makes us 
remember our friends!" The 
third, "Bathe, G-'epLalai! 
Bathe, Yaqoisai'!" calling the 
names of dancers. The fourth, 
"Else, friends!" also naming 
the dancers.^ 

In inviting the people, they 
begin with the women and men- 
tion the name of everybody 
living in the particular house, 
continuing with the names of 
the ha/mats'a and callin g finally 
the names of the que'qutsa. After the messengers have gone through 
the whole village, they return to the house of the ye'wix-ila saying: 
"We have been outside to the end of the village."^

Then the ye'wix-ila asks four other people to act as his messengers. 
Again he gives each a button blanket, a head ring and neck ring of red 
cedar bark, and eagle down for the head. They go to all the houses and 
invite the people to come at once. They go to each house and say, 
"Walk back."' 

As soon as the people begin to enter the house, the ye'wix-ila beats 
time on a board, in quick measures, concluding with a sharp rap and 

the call, "hai, liai." 

The Koskimo are the first to enter. Each 
man carries as many hemlock wreaths as 
he has killed enemies during war expedi- 
tions. They also carry bows and arrows. 
Then they step up to the middle of the 
house and throw one wreath after the other 
into the fire, calling the name of the enemy 
whom it represents. As soon as a wreath 
is thrown into the fire they call "ye," and 
all repeat this cry. At the same time they 
shoot arrows into the fire. This ceremony 
is called yi'lxoa, which means placing the 
head of an enemy on a pole. The fire is 
called XusE'la, which means fighting place. 
The whole ceremony is called al'Xts';iliL 
wa'lastEin (carrying blood into the house 
and giving away much property) or k-'a'- 
g''euLaxsta/la (sharp edge of knife). At 
present the wreaths represent the number 
of coppers which a man has given away. 
They have taken the place of heads, be- 
cause, according to the usages of the 
Kwakiutl, a man who has given away a 
copper by doing so becomes a victor over 
his rival. They also throw paddles into 
the fire, the meaning of which is that 
they send a caooe to call their rivals to a 
festival, in which they are going to show their greatness. 

After the Koskimo have entered, the niaa'mx'enox come in. Pieces 
of board representing dorsal fins are attached to their backs. They 
carry wreaths of hemlock branches in their hands. Their arms are 
stretched back and they make the motions of swimming, blowing from 
time to time like whales. They dro^) their wreaths in the rear of the 
house, go out again, take their fins ott', and reenter. Then the people 
beat time, and the maa'mx'enox, holding their blankets stretched out 
backward, enter. They take up their wreaths, and call the name of the 
copper or other property that they are going to give away. Then they

throw the wreaths into the fire. This means that they are going to rival 
the other tribes iu the amount of property that they will give away. 

The wives of the Koskimo, the qau'qotsaxsEm ( ? ), are the next to enter. 
Each of them carries a number of sticks, which represent the amount 
of property which they are going to give to their husbands. Each 
says what amount of i)ro])erty these sticks represent. They are fol- 
lowed by the qa'qao and k'e/k*exalaqa, the wives of the maa'mx'enox. 
Tliey also carry sticks and state how much property they are going to 
give away. 

Last of all the mEse/q, or Sea-egg, enters. Sharp sticks about 3 feet 
long are fastened to his clothing. Two men accom[)any him. When 
he comes to the rear of the house, all the sticks are i^ulled out from his 
clothing, and at the same time the 
names of all the coppers which were 
given away during the past year 
are called. Everyone who has given 
away blankets has one stick con 
tributed to the ornaments of this 
peculiar dancer. The sticks are then 
thrown into the fire, while all sing 
out, "ye!" 

The maa'mx'enox and d'o'd'opa 
then arrange themselves behind the 
fire, facing the rear of the house. 
The singing master stands behind 
them, facing the door and looking at 
the singers. The Koskimo and he'- 
melk siton each side of the house, the 
women in the rear row. (See p. 43G.) 

Finally the seal society enter in 
the same manner as described above 
p. 50G). 

While they are going to their seats 
the singers slip out singly through 
the secret door. Then suddenly they all reenter the house with great 
noise, and the people say: "The great maa'mx'enox have become 
excited." 1 They go around the fir-e slowly, holding their blankets 
spread out. Sometimes they are led by one of the me'emqoat. Then 
tliey pretend to pursue the latter.- If the member of the seal society 
sliould hapi)en to be a fool dancer, they endeavor to hit his nose, and 
as soon as they succeed in doing so he gets excited and stabs the 
people. During all this time the singing master remains in his place.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



After the singers have rearranged themselves in the rear of the fire, 
two of their number are sent to the door. Each has a rattle. They 
are the herahls who announce the dances which are to be performed 
that night in order to bring about the return of the novice. When 
the singers and the members of the seal society are in their jilaces, the 
people slip out singly and return to perform their dances. On this 
evening they do not show the highest dances which they possess, but 
those which they owned when they were children. On the whole the 
lower grades of dances come iu first, the higher ones later on, but there 
is no strict order. As soon as one of them approaches the house, the 
heralds shake their rattles, and upon this signal the singers begin to 
beat the boards rapidly, and continue to do so during the dance, at the 
end of which they sing one song of the dancer. The character of these 

dances was described in the i)receding 
chapter. 

When about one-half of all the dances 
have been shown, and particularly after 
a dance that has been well performed, two 
messengers (ho'Laq'is, listeners) are sent 
out by the speaker of the master of cere- 
monies to listen if no sign of the hfi'mats'a's 
return can be heard. They go out, listen, 
and come back saying that they have not 
heard anything. 

While the people are waiting for the 
dancers to come in, railleries are going 
on. The speaker of the yc/wix-ila sends 
the heralds: "Go to our friend (the bear 
dancer) and see if he has not washed."^ 
The herald goes out, after turning in the 
door. When he comes back, and the next dancer is to be a woman, he 
may say: "She will not come; she is fighting with her husband;" or, 
"She will not come; she and her husband are kissing each other." 

The dances continue until early, in the morning, when the ghost 
dancer appears. As soon as the people sing his song, all the old 
ha/mats'as, who have not entered the house so far, get excited, their 
whistles are blown by the he/lig-a, and they enter the house from all 
sides — through the roof, through the front door, and through the secret 
doors in the rear of the house. They jump down on the floor, squat, 
and, looking up, cry " hap hap ! " They j ump around the fire four times, 
looking up and crying "hap!" all the time. Their cries are supposed 
to be heard by the novice in the woods, who is heard all of a sudden 
on the roof of the house. He runs around four times. Three times 
he i)ushes t)ie boards of the roof aside, and then he jumps down. The

j)eople surround him and try to hold him. He runs around the fire 
four times, but all of a sudden he has disappeared a^iain, having made 
his exit through the secret door in the rear of the 
house. Only the hemlock branches with which he 
was adorned remain in the house. As soon as tbe 
people see that he has disappeared, they say that 
somebody has made a mistake which angered tbe 
ha'mats'aand caused him to leave the house again. 

Not always is the ha'mats'a induced to return in 
the manner described here. Sometimes the xoa'exoe 
dances and the earthquake that is thus produced 
brings him back, or the dance of the t'd'X'uit may 
bring him back. 

In some instances a particular ofticer, the lcIc'l'- 
alenox, must try to call tlie novice. He is considered 
the chief of all the que/qutsa. He wears a rough 
head ring and neck ring of red cedar bark which is 
twisted four times. His face is blackened. He enters 
cariying a baton and stops in front of the fire. If 
anyone should laugh, he points at him, and the per- 
son who is -thus singled out must look downward. 
He goes around the fire singing his secret song, as 
follows:^ 



Ah, ah, supernatural power!

In the rear of the house he turns once, cries "hu!" 

and stoops down to listen. Then he continues his 

circuit and repeats this action in front of the house. 

While he is doing so the ha'mats'a appears on 

the roof, in the rear right hand corner of the house, 

runs around the roof, and opens a hole on the left hand front corner 

and looks down into the house. From here he rushes to the rear left 

corner of the house. Then he runs to 
the rear right corner, and to the front 
right corner, pushes the boards aside, 
and looks down into the house. Then 
the people take a number of blankets, 
spread them out tight, and hold them 
under the place where the ha'mats'a is 
looking down. Finally he jumps down 
into the blankets in the front right cor- 
ner of the house. They try to hold him, 

and slowly go around the tire trying to lay their hands upon him, but 

he disappears again. Only his hemlock branches are left in the hands 

of the people.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



Theu the LEle'L'alenox says that the laughing of the person whom 
he pointed out iu the begiiiniug was the cause of the clisappeaiauee 
of the ha'mats'a. The laugher mnst call his daughter to dance, 
and he must take a staff (the feast pole (jfi'sop'eq) in his hands and 
promise to give a feast after her dance. 

If any other mistake should have been 
made, the LEle'L'alGuox points it out in a 
similar way. When, for instance, a woman 
has brought her uninitiated children into 
the house, he will say on entering, "I smell 
someone who is profane;"^ and the people 
will reply, '^ Important is your word."' 
Then he asks for red cedar bark, which 
is given to him. He makes a neck ring 
and a head ring (figs. 186, 187, pp. 527, 
528). He asks one man to beat time. 
Then he sings his secret song, and sud- 
denly the voices of birds (whistles) are 
heard on top of the house. He holds the 
red cedar bark in front of his face, push- 
ing it forward with every stej) and crying, 
"o, o, op, op." Then he puts the cedar 
bark on the child's head. The birds' voices 
suddenly disappear, and are heard on the 
roof of the house of the child's father. 
Then that child must disappear, it being 
supposed that he has been taken away by 
these spirits. 

After the novice has disappeared again, 
the chief's speaker asks all the people to 
make themselves ready to expect the nov- 
ice on the following morning. All this 
time his whistles are heard in the woods. 
Then the people go to their houses and 
have a short rest, but after about an hour 
or two the ye'wix-ila calls them to his 
house and asks them to try to catch the 
new ha'mats'a. He says: "Take care! we want to save our great 
friend."^ Then the master of ceremonies requests the seal society to 
assemble, and the que'qutsa to follow them. He says, " Gather seals ! " '

Tlie k'i'nqalaLala lead the way, each singing her secret song. All the 
people follow them toward the beach. The first k-i'nqalaLala sings : ^ 

Yiya haul yiyaha. I am the real tamer of BaxbakiifilauuXsl'waf'. 

Yiya ham yiyaha. I pull the red cedar bark from BaxbakualanuXsI'wae's back. 

Then the second one sings:' 

It is my power to pacify you, when you are in a state of ecstasy. - 

They go westward, and as soon as they come to the place called 
Naii'alak'nas (place of sui)eniatural power), about one-eighth of a mile 
west of the village, four sons or 
relatives of the ye'wix-ila are sent 
out to gather hemlock branches. 
During this time the singers sing 
the new songs which were made 
on the preceding day in the woods, 
in order to enable the other people 
to learn these songs. Now, the 
boys return, bringing the hemlock 
branches, which are used for mak- 
ing head and neck rings for the 
people. All the quc'qutsa form a 
row and take each others' hands. 
They sing the new songs and go 
forward. The old ha'mats'as and 
the other members of the seal society go before them. TheU' all of a 
sudden the new ha/mats'a appears, and is surrounded by the people, 
but he disappears again. It is not the novice himself who appears at 
this time, but some other man who looks like him, and who while being 
surrounded by the "seals" takes off his hemlock dress and dresses in 

red cedar bark like the other seals, 
so that apparently the ha/mats'a has 
disappeared again, leaving only his 
hemlock dress. Suddenly the novice 
is seen again in front of the village. 
Everybody runs to take him, but he 
disappears again in the same man- 
ner as before. After a short time he 
is seen again at Nau'alak'uas. He 
is surrounded, but disappears a third 
time. Then all the people form a 
row, take each others' hands, and each begins to sing his own secret 
song. Thus they approach the village, where the ha'mats'a is seen 
again. One man strips off his clothing and goes in front of the people. 
He is called the bait of the tribe (te'lEm). As soon as the ha'mats'a 
sees him he rushes up to him, seizes his arm, and bites it. Then the

people catch him and k'ad him toward the house, singing the new 
songs. (Phite 44.) The he'lig-a sing their secret songs, and the unini- 
tiated cry "hoi'p." By this means they attempt to tame the ha'mats'a. 
The people lead him to the house of the ye'wix-ila, who, on their 
approach, steps out of the house with his whole family, dressed in red 
cedar bark ornaments and hutton blankets. Their faces are marked 
with black spots. Their heads are covered with down. They dance in 
front of the bouse, accompanying the new songs. Some of the ye/wi 
x-ila's relatives go down to the people, who lead the ha'mats'a, and 
hold boards in their hands for the jDCople to beat time on. Then the 
latter begin to sing as follows: "Woe! you are making your iiarents 
poor, naualak !" ' Then they walk into the house. After they have all 
entered, the new k-i'nqalaLala who returned with tlie hfi'mats'a from 

the woods, and who, during the 
ceremony, is entirely naked, be- 
gins to sing her new song. She 
enters the house going backward, 
facing the ha'mats'a, whom she 
desires to lead into the house. 
The ha'mats'a, however, is appar- 
ently unwilling to enter, and stays 
for about half an hour in the door, 
where he turns four times, the he'- 
lig*a surrounding him all the 
time. During this time the i^eo- 
ple raise the ha'msi^'rq and the 
mil'wiL. As soon as it is com- 
pleted, the ha'mats'a leaves the 
door, goes to the right until he 
comes to the rear of the house, 
and climbs the ha'msp'eq. He 
ascends the roof of the house, 
runs around once, and returns, 
descending the ha'msp'eq, or he 
jumps down from the door of the

Then he climbs the ha'msij'eq again, runs around the roof, and after 
he comes down again bites another man. This is repeated four times. 
The people during this time sing the new songs, and the ha'mats'a 
dances around the fire, but not properly, as he is supposed to be still 
out of his senses. After he has danced around the fire the fourth 
time, he goes into the ma'wiL. Then all the people take off the hemlock 
branches and throw tliem into the fire. This is called smoking the 
wildness of BaxbakualanuXsi'wae out of the ha'mats'a. Then they 
arrange themselves according to the societies to which they belong. 
The ye'wix'ila who stands at the left-hand side of the door says: "I

coppers."^ Tlie name by which he calls himself here is the one which 
he assumes at this festival. Then the members of the society to 
which he belongs take the brass bracelets and the coppers out of the 
box and give them to him. He says : " I obtained this property from 
my father-in-law, and I am going to distribute it now according to the 
laws of the winter dance." ^ 

The ye'wix-ila turns everything over to the master of ceremonies or 
to one of his own relatives, who in their turn distribute the i^roperty 
among the assembly, giving the women first, then the "seals," and 
lastly the que'qutsa, each jierson receiving one stick of bracelets and 
one stick of copi)ers. After the property has been distributed, the 
people go home and take their breakfast in their own houses. 

In the evening the ye'wix-ila again requests four messengers to invite 
the i)eople. He tells them the names of the new ha/mats'a and k-i'n- 
qalaLala, and tells them to call the people to come to his house, in order 
to tame the new ha'mats'a and k'i'nqalaLala. Each of these messen- 
gers receives o^ie bjitton blanket. They go to the various houses and 
say:^ 

"Shamans! We will pacify this su])ernatural one. We will soften 
(TsE'mqok-aLa)^ by means of our songs. Friends! We will pacify this 
supernatural one. We will restore to her senses (He'lig'ixsteg-ilisa).^ 
Let us go into the dancing house before dark !" 

After they return to the dancing house, the ye'wix-ila calls four 
more messengers, who also receive a button blanket each in payment 
for their services. They must go to the end of the village, and begin- 
ning at the last house they must say: "We come back to call you. 
The fire is going out. We have no fuel. Come quick, shamans!"*' The 
people follow them at once, and all enter the dancing house.

530 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

During the whole day the whistles of the hii'mats'a were heard in the 
house. Then the speaker of the ye/wix-ila says as follows : "Friends, 
do as I desire ! Try to pacify our friend ! Let all the women dance !"' 
This is a request to the women to dance with the ha'mats'a in order to 
tame him. The master of ceremonies calls upon all the ha'mshamtsEs, 
the hai'alik-ilaL, the t'o'X'uit, and the k-i'nqalaLala to dance with the 
lifi'mats'a. They blacken their faces, put eagle down on their heads, 
iind l)egin to dance. Then the h<l/mats'a shakes the ha'msp'cq and 
coines out of the ma/wiL. At once the people begin to beat the boards, 
but do not sing. The ha'mats'a goes around the fire once and disap- 
pears again in the ma/wiL. The master of ceremonies says : "Some- 
body must have made a mistake," and calls up tlie i>axa'lalaL — that 
means the shaman dancer. He steps forward, calls for a round rattle, 
and as soon as the master of ceremonies has given it to him he begins 
to sing the song of the paxa'lalaL,^ "You took me around the world, 
BaxbakuillanuXsi'wae." He goes around the fire and then enters the 
ma'wiL at the same place where the hfl/mats'a went in. He stays 
there for about ten minutes and then reappears, saying that the people 
have made too much noise, and that they did not have enough down on 
their heads, and that the ha/mats'a had disappeared again for these 
reasons. The master of ceremonies calls for four dishes of eagle down. 
Then four men come out of the right hand front corner of the house 
carrying the dishes and saying that they were waiting for the orders 
of the master of ceremonies. He sends the four men to feather the 
heads of the people, beginning with the ha'mats'a, continuing with the 
other "seals," and finishing with the que'qutsa. Then the master of 
ceremonies says that the eagle down brought into the house super- 
natural power (which is not supposed to be present where there is no 
down). 

Now the ha'mats'a is seen to leave the ma'wiL again. He jumps 
down, goes around the fire once, and disappears again. Again the 
paxa'lalaL is sent to discover if a mistake has been made which 
induced the ha'mats'a to leave again. He sings the same song as 
before, enters the ma/wiL, where he stays for some time. He reappears 
and says that the ha'mats'a was displeased because the hc'iig-a did 
not sing their secret song. Tlien four he'lig-a are sent into the ma/wiL. 
The ye'wix-ila gives four button blankets to the master of ceremonies 
and requests him to do with them whatever he pleases. The master 
of ceremonies gives them to the he'lig-a, who then begin to sing: " Wa

ya JO he ya ye ha ye ha, hoip." 

Now they enter the inawiL, and after a short time bring out the 
lia'mats'a, who bites the arm of one of them. As soon as they approach 
the door of the house, the hfi'mats'a lets go his hokl, turns around, 
and bites a second one in the same way. They continue their way, and, 
when they reach the ma/wiL, the ha'mats'a disai)pears once more. The 
he'lig'a follow him, and soon lie reappears, biting the third one. As 
soon as they come to the door, he lets go his hold and bites the fourth 
one. When they reach the rear of the house again, the he'lig-a do not 
allow him to reenter the ma/wiL. The people beat time rapidly. Dur- 
ing these ceremonies the ha'mats'a is entirely naked, with the exception 
of a wreath of hemlock branches which he wears around his neck, one 
around his head, one around the waist, and bracelets and anklets of the 
same material. 

Now the people begin to sing the new songs which were made for 
the ha/mats'a. After the first song has been sung, he disappears in 
the ma/wiL, and immediately the mask of QoaqoaXualanuXsI'wae, the 
raven, appears. After the mask has disappeared, the ha'mats'a appears 
again, entirely naked. When he has finished his dance, the mask of 
BaxbakualanuXsI'wae comes out (see p. 440). The mask disappears in 
the uia/wiL, and the ha'mats'a comes out again dancing slowly. He 
wears a crown of red cedar bark on his head, a wide neck ring of the 
same material, anklets, bracelets, a dancing apron, and a bear skin. 
Then the people continue to sing the new songs which were made for 
him. The master of ceremonies spreads a new mat in the middle of the 
rear of the house in front of the singers. After his dance the ha'mats'a 
sits down on this mat, facing the rear of the house. Then the k-i'nqala- 
Lala comes out of the ma'wiL singing her new secret song. After she 
has finished, the i)eople sing the new songs which were made for her in 
the woods. She dances until the two songs are finished. Then the 
master of ceremonies calls up a man named Ts'e'qame (que'qutsa name) ; 
'' Come, friend, try if you can reach our friend." ^ This is the request to 
him to tame the ha'mats'a. Ts'e'qame asks for four pieces of white 
soft cedar bark, which are given to him by the ye'wix-ila.' Ts'e'qame 
takes them, crying " hoip, lioip." That means that he is putting the 
secret of the winter dance into the bark. He asks for a pole (about 
■feet long), which is given to him by the ye'wix-ila, or by the brotlier of 
the latter, who is looking after the fire. Ts'e'qame ties the four pieces 
of cedar bark to the end of the pole. Each piece is about 8 feet long. 
He tells the people to be ready to beat time when the signal is given. 
He asks one of the k'i'nqalaLala to talie off the clothing of the hfi'mats'a. 

'Qelag-a ade', qas gu'nx-'itads do'qoaL qas goayo'Lasos ax gins nEmo'xtsek-. 

Come, friend, for to try see that yon reach our friend. 

2 He says; Ax'e'ta g-ax k-a'tsekoaqaE'n; luoxsaE'iiiLe. 
Give white cedar bark me four pieces only. 



532 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The k-i'uqalaLala goes around the fire saying ^'lioip, hoip, hoip, hoip," 
and then takes the h I'mats'a's clothing and cedar bark ornaments off. 
Then Ts'c'qanic gives the signal to the people to begin beating time, and 
as soon as they begin he i)nts one end of the cedar bark into the fire. He 
runs around tlie fire until he comes to the place where the ha/mats'a is 
sitting. Here he swings the burning bark over the ha/matsa's head, and 
at the same time the latter turns around sf^uatting and crying "hap, 
hap, hap." Ts'e'qame goes around the fire once more, and keeping 
his eye on the ha'mats'a until he reaches him tlie second time he swings 
again the burning cedar bark over his head. This is done four times. 
This is called nawa'qama. Then the he/lig-a lift the ha'mats'a, lug him 
around the fire, and take him into the ma'wiL. The master of cere- 
monies now calls the ye'wix-ila and asks him to pay Ts'e'qame for his 
work. The ye'wix-ila goes into his bedroom and brings out a button 
blanket, which he gives to him. Then the ye'wix-ila asks the master 
of ceremonies or one of his relatives to distribute the rest of the brass 
bracelets, coj^pers, and button blankets among the people. Each 
person receives one stick of bracelets, one stick of coppers, and one 
button blanket. 

Now all the profane must leave the house. The door is closed and 
the j)urification of the ha'mats'a begins. Four men must take part 
in this ceremony, — the kue'ts'cnox or the washer, the qa'nenox or 
the rubber, the ts'e'silaenox or the tongsmaker, and the t'a'mtse- 
nox or the time beater. Whatever these men ask for incidentally 
to the ceremcmy must be given to them, and they retain it as their 
X)ersonal property. When everything is quiet, the ts'e'silaenox asks 
for a piece of cedar board about 6 feet long, for a wedge, and for a 
stone hammer. After this is brought to him, the t'a'mtsenox sits 
down in his i)lace ready to beat time. Then the ts'e'silaenox asks for 
a belt. After he has received it, he i)uts it on, goes around the fire 
four times, carrying a rattle in his hand, w^hile the t'a'mts'enox is beat- 
ing time. He does not sing, but says -'hoip, hoip." After he has gone 
around the fire four times, he stops, puts his rattle down, and stoops 
three times, as though he was going to take up the hammer and wedge, 
but he does not really take it until he stoops down the fourth time. 
Every time he stoops the t'a'mtsenox gives a short rap on the board. 
Then the ts'e'silaenox goes around the fire until he comes to the place 
where the board is lying on the ground. He steps up to it, turns once 
to the left, i>uts his wedge against the board, and pretends to drive it 
in with his stone hammer, but he takes it off again, turns once more to 
the left, and places it a second and third time against the board. 
The fourth time he really, with one hard blow, drives the wedge into the 
board and splits it. Then he asks the yc/wix-ila for a knife, and after 
it is given to him he makes a pair of tongs out of the cedar board. 
Then he asks for a clean mat and for a piece of soft white cedar bark. 
He takes it uj) with his tongs, goes around the fire, and gives it to the 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 533 

qa'nenox. Every time these meu go aroiiud the fire the t'a'mtseuox 
must beat the boards. 

Then the qa'iienox takes the mat and spreads it on the floor at the 
left-hand side of the door, and lays the cedar bark on it. lie begins to 
rub the bark and to cut it. When cutting, he draws his knife three 
times, pretending to cut, and every time he does so he turns to the 
left. The fourth time he really begins to cut the bark. One of the 
pieces which he cuts is about G feet, and two other pieces about 2 feet 
long each. A knot is tied in the middle of the long piece, which is then 
tied in shape of a ring, the ends crossing each other and leaving about 
1 foot free. The two shorter j)ieces arc tied near the middle of the long 
piece, so that the whole forms a ring with two ends on one side and two 
ends near the middle. The ring represents the body, the knot the head, 
the upper ends the arms, and the lower ends the feet of a person. 

Now he rises and gives a signal to the t'a'mtsenox to beat time. He 
goes around the fire once and stops near the tongs which the ts'e'si- 
laenox made. Then he puts the ring down. Now the ts'e'silaenox 
rises. He spreads the tongs with a small stick. Three times he pre- 
tends to take them up, turning each time. The fourth time he really 
takes them and goes toward the ring of white cedar bark, the qa'na'yu. 
At this time the t'a'mtsenox begins to beat time again. The ts'c'sila- 
enox goes around the fire with the tongs in his hands and keeps his 
eye on the qa'na'yu all the time. When he comes to the mat on which 
it is lying, he ])retends to take it ui) with the tongs, but he does not 
touch it. Then he turns around to the left and extends his arms 
toward the place of the rising sun. Every time he does so the t'a'm- 
tsenox gives a hard rap on the board, and the people cry " wa ! " This is 
repeated three times; the fourth time he takes the qa'ua'yu, and goes 
around the fire four times until he arrives at the east side of the house. 

Then he pushes up the tongs three times. The fourth time he turns 
them around and places the handle under the roof of the east side of the 
house. He goes around the fire four times. Then he pretends to take 
up four stones with his tongs. He does not really take them until the 
fourth time. During this time the t'a'mtsenox beats again. Then the 
kucts'enox asks for a new dish, which is put on the floor. He asks for 
water, which is brought to him in a bucket. When he takes the latter, 
he gives a signal to the t'a'mtsenox to beat. He walks around the 
fire with the water, while all the people say " wa wa wa.'' Every 
time he comes to the point where he started, either opposite the door 
or in the rear of the house, he turns and lifts his bucket toward the sun. 
Every time he does so the t'a'mtsenox stops with a loud rap. After 
he has done so four times, he goes to the dish, which is standing at the 
left-hand side from the door. Three times he pretends to pour out 
water, and the fourth time he empties it into the dish. After this has 
been done, the new ha'mats'a is called to come out from the ma'wiL. 
He and the k-i'nqalaLala come out entirely naked. A new mat is i)ut 



534 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

down for them uext to tlie dish. The qa'iieiiox holds the mat in his 
hands, turns, and pretends to put it down. After he has done so three 
times, he really puts it down. Every time he turns he says, "hoi'p." 
The fourth time, after putting down the mat, the k-i'nqalaLala sings 
the he'lig-a song.' The k-i'nqalaLala goes four times around the fire 
singing. The ha'mats'a must follow her, and every time the k'l'nqala- 
Lala turns he must turn too. They turn whenever they reach the point 
opposite the door and in the rear of the house. After they hav'e made 
four circuits, they sit down, the ha/mats'a looking wild all the time, as 
though he wanted to bite the people. The qa'nenox rises and goes 
around the fire after signaling the t'a'mtsenox to heat time. He takes 
a small stick, and places it in the wall of the house a little below the 
tongs on which the qa'nfiyu is hanging, but before really placing it 
there he pretends to make the motion three times, tnrning after each 
motion. Then he attempts to take the qa'nayu from the tongs, but he 
really does not take it down until after he has made the motion three 
times. As soon as he really takes it, the t'a'mtsenox gives a loud rap, 
and says " ya." Then the qa'nenox turns once and puts the <{a'nayu 
on the short stick. Again he goes around the fire while the t'a'mtse- 
nox is beating time. He goes to the tongs, turns around once, and 
takes them down. 

He goes around the fire holding the tongs downward. During this 
time the t'a'mtsenox beats time. The qa'nenox stops at the door and 
holds the tongs toward the door. Then the kue'ts'enox rises, and with 
a common baton he strikes the small stick which spreads the tongs, 
thus throwing it out of the door. If the stick should happen to strike 
the walls of the house and not hit the door, it forebodes short life for 
the ha'mats'a. Then the ts'e'silaenox turns and goes around the fire. 
Three times he pretends to take the stones out of the fire, every time 
extending the tongs towards the sun. The fourth time he really takes 
the stones up. Then the people cry "wa wa." He turns, goes around 
the fire four times, and stops near the dish containing the water. Three 
times he pretends to throw the stones into the water, and every time 
he does so the t'a'mtsenox beats time. The fourth time he throws them 
into the water. 

This ceremony is performed with each stone singly. Then he goes 
again around the fire and puts the tongs back under the roof in the 
same place where they were before. 

Now the kue'ts'enox rises. He goes around the fire stretching his 
right hand backward and shaking it. This is the signal for the t'a'm- 
tsenox to beat the board as hard as possible. Every time he reaches 
the east and the west side of the fire he turns around and the beater 
gives one short rap. Every time he comes to the turning point he 
extends his hands toward the qa'na'yu as though he was going to 
take it down. His hands are shaking all the time like those of Bax- 

1 It is my power to pacify you (see page 527). 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 535 

bakualanuXsT'wae. The fourth time he really takes the qa'na'yii down. 
Its "head'' is hi his left hand, its lower end in his right hand. He 
holds his left hand stretched forward. He goes around the fire, and at 
the turning point extends the ring toward the sun. Every time he 
does so the t'a'mtseuox gives a short beat. 

He walks around the fire four times, and finally stops near the 
ha'mats'a. Then the qa'nenox calls the kuets'enox to come to the 
ha'mats'a. The kuets'enox goes aroung the fire four times, stoi)S at 
the dish holding the water, and stoops down three times, intending to 
dip water out with his hands. He does not really take it until the 
fourth time. He holds the water in his two hands, goes around the 
fire, lifts it toward the sun, turns around, and puts it on the head of 
the ha'mats'a, softly stroking the latter. Then he takes more water, 
puts it again on the ha'mats'a's head in the same manner. This cere- 
mony is also repeated four times. The k-i'nqalaLala sits next to the 
ha'mats'a. The kue'ts'enox turns around and puts four haudfuls of 
water on her head in the same way as he x>ut it on that of the 
ha'mats'a. Then the qa'nenox rises again and the t'a'mtsenox beats 
time. He goes around the fire carrying the ring, and on the west side 
he extends it toward the sun. Then he walks around to the ha'mats'a, 
turns slowly, and puts the ring over the ha'mats'a's head, doubling it 
up and wiping his whole body. The ha'mats'a first extends his right 
arm, then his left arm, through the ring. When the ring comes down 
to his feet, he raises his right leg first, puts it down outside the ring, 
turns all around on his right foot, then takes up his left foot, and sits 
down on the mat, facing east. The qa'nenox takes the ring up, turns 
around, and drops his left hand and raises his right hand alternately. 

Again tlie ha'mats'a extends his right arm, and he rubs him in the 
same way as the first time. This is repeated four times. Then the 
qa'nenox goes around the fire and x>erforms the same ceremony with 
the k-i'nqalaLala. Then the people sing: "In olden times you went 
all around the world with the supernatural being." ^ 

The qa'nenox takes the tongs down from the roof and takes up the 
qa'na'yu, while the t'a'mtsenox is beating time. He goes around the 
fire swinging the ring, turns in the front and in the rear of the house, 
raising the ring toward the sun. After he has gone around the fire 
four times, lie swings the ring over the fire until it ignites. Then all 
the people say "wa wa." He walks out of the house, and burns the 
ring on the street. Then he burns the tongs in the house. Then all 
the people are allowed to enter the house. 

After the song has been sung, the ha'mats'a gets excited, leaves the 
house, and runs around the village. 

The ye'wix'ila now brings all his dishes and kettles, spoons and mats, 
and distributes them among the people of his tribe, thepeoi)le going to 
the i)ile and each taking one piece. This celebration lasts until it is 
nearly daylight. 



' Appendix, page 724. 



536 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

About this time the four officers, the kue'ts'enox, the qa'nenox, the 
ts'e'silaeiiox, and the fa^mtsPuox, leave the house, the last named car- 
rying the baton. Then they say : ^ " Here is food for you (lur'qutsa." 

This is the notice for the last great feast in the winter dance cere- 
monies. At this time they count up all the mistakes made by the 
ha/mats'a.^ 

For four days after this the ha'mats'a runs about biting the people. 
On the fourth night the ye'wix-ila calls his society and tells them that 
the lia'msp'cq is to be burnt. A messenger belonging to his society is 
sent out to call all the i)eople together. He is given a button blanket 
and a new head ring and neck ring. This messenger goes to every 

house and says : ^ " Friends, we will tame our great friend ." 

Then the whole tribe, men, women, and children, assemble. They sing 
the ha'mats'a songs, and during the ensuing day the ye'wix-ila pays 
them for their bites, the price being one canoe for each bite. The 
women who danced receive bracelets; the men who sang, button blan- 
kets. These presents must be returned with interest when the receivers 
give a festival another year. 

All the que'qutsa must now leave the building. The fool dancers 
and bears are also required to go out. Only the ha'mats'a, ha'msham- 
tsEs, no'ntsistalaL, qoe'qoasElaL, na'ne of BaxbakualanuXsI'wae, and 
k-i'nqalaLala; the laxsa, stay. They nail the door up and close all 
the chinks and holes in the walls. The k-i'nqalaLala take the batons, 
then all the ha'mats'as begin to cry " hap, hap." The ha'mshamtsEs cry 
" wip, wij), wip,"and all the others utter their peculiar sounds. The k-i'n- 
qalaLala beat time, and each sings his own song. During this time the 
ha'mats'a gets excited, goes around the fire and around the ha'msp'eq 
four times. Then they lift the ha'msp'eq and pull it down, laying it so 
that it slants down from the roof. During this ceremony all the ha'ma- 
ts'as are naked. Four times they go up and down the ha'msp'eq while 
it IS in this position, crying " hap, hap." Then the ha'msp'f'q is taken 
down entirely. The ha'mats'as cut it into four pieces, while the k-i'nqa- 
laLala and the others who are present make as much noise as i^ossible. 
Then four ha'mats'as carry each piece. They carry it around the fire, 
turning in front and in the rear of the house, and crying "hap" all 
the time. Then they throw the pieces into the tire. N"ext, the ma'wiL 
is pulled down and burnt with similar ceremonies. For four days they 
remain in the house singing the new ha'mats'a songs. On the fourth 
day they dress in red cedar bark, strew their heads with feathers, and 
blacken their faces. Then the wa'leqa — the first meal of the hfi'mats'a

after his return from the bush — is celebrated. The k-i'nqalaLala leaves 
the house, followed by the ha/mats'a, each singiug his own song. They 
go into four houses and are fed by the people. The hn'mats'a must 
eat all th.at is given to him. Then they walk into the next house, where 
they are fed again. 

Now the whole tribe assembles again in the house of the ye'wix-ila. 
A canoe mast is put up in the middle of the house, and the master of 
ceremonies asks, "Who will take the red cedar bark off from the people 
and keep it until next winter?" Whoever intends to give a winter 
dance the following winter must step up and take hold of the stick. 
Then all the people take their rings off and throw them into the fire. 
Four only are kept until the next year. The people tie handkerchiefs 
around their heads in place of the cedar bark. 

Then " the sound of the batons is driven out of the house." The 
l^eople beat time four times and then throw all the sticks into the fire. 
This is the end of the winter dance. 

After biting persons, and particularly after eating slaves or bodies, 
the ha'mats'a must observe a great many rules. Immediately after they 
have eaten of a corpse, the he'lig-a brings them salt water, of which 
they drink great quantities in order to produce vomiting. If they do 
not vomit as many pieces as they have swallowed, their excrements are 
examined in order to ascertain if all the pieces of human flesh have 
passed the body. The bones of the body that they have eaten are kept 
for four months. They are kept alternately four days in their bedrooms 
on the north side of the house where the sun does not strike them, and 
four days under rocks in the sea. Finally they are thrown into the sea. 

The ha/mats'as are not allowed to go out of the house do(n^, but they 
must use the secret door in the rear of the house only. When one of 
them goes out to defecate, all the others must go with him, each carry- 
ing a small stick. They must all sit down together on a long log. 
They must rise again three times, and do not sit down until the fourth 
time. Before sitting down they must turn four times. Before they 
rise they must turn four times. Then they go back to the house. 
Before entering they must raise their feet four times. With the fourth 
step they really pass the door. They go in, the right foot first. In the 
doorway they turn four times and walk slowly into the house. They 
are not allowed to look back. 

For four months after eating human flesh the ha'mats'a uses a spoon, 
dish, and kettle of his own, which are thrown away after the lapse of 
the prescribed time. 

He must wear soiled cedar bark. He must stay alone in his bedroom. 
A grizzly bear dancer is placed in the doorway to see that no one 
enters. 

Before taking water out of a bucket or before dipping it out of a 
brook he nmst dip his cup three times into the water. He must not 
take more than four mouthfuls at one time. 



538 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

He must carry a wing bone of an eagle and drink through it, as his 
lips must not touch the brim of his cup. He also wears a copper nail 
to scratch his head with, as his nails must not touch his skin, else they 
would come off. For sixteen days after he has eaten human flesh he 
must not eat any warm food, and for four months he is not allowed to 
blow hot food in order to cool it. For a whole year he must not touch 
his wife, nor is he allowed to gamble or to work. When the dancing 
season is over, he feigns to have forgotten the ordinary ways of man, 
and has to learn everything anew. He acts as though he were very 
hungry all the time. 

The whole ceremonial of bringing back the novice is, according to 
the ideas of the Kwakiutl, a repetition of the same ceremonial per- 
formed by the wolves who attempted to bring back their novices; and 
the following tradition, which, however, is not complete in all its details, 
is made to account for its origin : ' 

Mink made a salmon trap back of Qa'logwis, the village of the 
Kwakiutl. The different tribes held a winter ceremonial, and the sons 
of the chief of the wolves had disappeared in the woods. While there 
they spoiled Mink's salmon trap. For three days they did so. Then 
Mink became angry. He made up his mind to watch who was tamper- 
ing Avith his salmon trap. He went there in the evening and hid near 
his salmon weir. Now the four sons of the wolf, who had disappeared 
in the woods, came. They went right up to the salmon weir and took 
out the salmon that had gone into it. Then Mink said to himself, 
" You are the ones who tampered with my weir." They sat down and 
ate the salmon raw. Mink crawled up to them from behind and killed 
them with his club. He cut off" their heads, and went home carrying 
the four heads. Xobody knew that he had killed them ; even his mother 
did not know it. 

Now the wolves were going to bring back their novices after two 
days. When the time came for bringing the novices back, Kue'kuaxaoe 
was master of ceremonies. Mink closed all the holes and cliinks of his 
own iiouse, and tied ropes of cedar around it to strengthen it. 

Before daylight Mink went in his canoe to Me'mk'umlis. He made a 
salmon weir of stones. Then he went and sat down on a rock. He 
looked at his weir. '' What fish is in my trap ?" he said. "A small bull 
head,'' replied the trap. Then he scratched his head. "Oh, that is 
])retty; 1 am working hard looking after my trap! Throw it into the 
water!" He asked again, "What fish is in my trap?" It replied, "A 
small flounder." He threw it into the water, and then the trap had 
caught tirst an eel, then a dogfish, a perch, a silver perch, a cohoes sal- 
mon, a dog salmon, a humpback salmon, a steel-head salmon, a spring 
salmon, and finally a si'siuL. Then he said, "That is it; that is it!" 
and he was glad. He took the si'siuL out of his trap and put it down 
on the rock. He broke off hemlock branches, laid them into his canoe, 
and put the fish on top of them. Then he went home to his house at 



' Appendix, pa.^e 725. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 539 

Qa'logwis. He went ashore to liis liouse. His mother was lying down. 
Then Mink spoke: "Don't stay here, grandmother, but carry my fish 
into the liouse." His mother went down to the beach. She went to 
the canoe and looked in vain for the tish. Her body became contorted; 
her head looked backward, because she had seen the si'siuL. Mink 
waited for his mother a long time. Then he arose and went to look 
for her. He found her, and saw that her whole body was contorted. 
"That is the way, grandmother! Are you so glad?" He took her and 
straightened her body. He carried the si'siuL himself from the beach 
to the house. He put it into a box. It became evening. The people 
intended to bring back the novices that night. In vain they beat the 
boards for the expected ones. They had been killed by Mink. 

The people were still singing in the house. One of the chiefs said, 
"Let us try, dancers, to bring back our novices." But when they did 
not come after numerous attempts, one of them spoke: "Dancers, we 
are not going to succeed in bringing back our novices." One of them 
replied, " Wash yourselves, friends." Then the last one spoke: " You 
who are not initiated, turn your faces toward the rear of the house. 
We will go in' before dark." Then the people thought they would have 
to give up trying to bring back their novices. They listened, but did 
not hear the arrival of the supernatural power. 

Up to this time Mink had not made his appearance. Then the people 
said, "What is the matter with our chief K-ex* (mink)?" They went 
to fetch him. Now Mink, and his cousins the raccoon, the killer whale, 
and the squirrel, did what they had planned. His sister Ts'E'stayukoa 
and the raccoon went and pulled out a board in the rear corner of the 
dancing house. The raccoon sat down in that corner. Now K-ex* 
came in. He danced a little while and went out again. Then he came 
in and danced again with his sister. He sang, — 

Spread your legs, Ts'E'stayukoa, 
Spread your legs, Ts'E'stayukoa,— 

and jumi)ed through between the spread legs of his sister. 

Then he came in again. He wore the heads of the wolves for his 
mask. But he was hiding them behind his blanket. He sang: 

Miuk is wearing the middle of the face of the sons of the chief of the wolves. 

He went out again; and when he came in, the heads of the wolves 
were attached to his blanket. Now the people tried to kill him, 
because they saw that he had killed the sous of their chief. Then he 
went out of the doorway in the rear while his friends the squirrel and 
the raccoon w ere beating the drum. He came in again wearing the 
si'siuL mask. As soon as he entered the door he uncovered the mask, 
and all the people died in convulsions when they saw it. Then K-ex* 
selected all his relatives and the people whom he liked and resuscitated 
them. That is the end. 

The initiation of members of the lower grades of the ts'e'tsaeqa 
is not attended with as elaborate ceremonies as that of the la'xsa. 



540 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Their initiatioii is called kne'xalak". Those who are initiated by the 
kiie'xalak" ceremonies are called g-ixsCg-i, that means, leaning against 
the wall of the ma'wiL. In most cases they retnrn from their initia- 
tions during the festivals celebrated to bring back a novice of the 
la'xsa, Sometimes, however, while the people are assembled at a 
feast, the wi'xsa or kne'xalak" novice is taken away by the spirits, and 
then his father announces that four days hence he will be brought 
back. He calls the master of ceremonies of the kue/xalak", who wears 
a head ring ornamented with five feathers, — one in front, one on each 
side, and two in the back. His face is painted red. He enters 
and begins to go around the tire, swinging his baton from the elbow. 
When he reaches the rear of the house, he turns around, swinging his 
stick, and then gives one rap on a board, crying at the same time 
"ha'mamamama" (very rapidly). As soon as he does so, all the peo- 
j)le strike the boards. Meanwhile the master of ceremonies turns 
around, strikes the board again, crying " hamamai'." Again all the peo- 
ple strike the boards together and cry "ha'mamamama." These cries 
represent the sounds made by the ghosts. The master of ceremonies 
continues his circuit, swinging his baton all the time. When he reaches 
the door, he turns again and proceeds. When he reaches the rear of 
the house the second time, the same ceremony is repeated. He con- 
tinues his circuit in the same way as before. When he reaches the rear 
of the house the third time, he turns and cries "yehee"' and gives a 
rap on the boards ; then all the people cry " yehee/hoooo." This repre- 
sents the sound of the wolf. While the people are l>eating time the 
master of ceremonies turns again and then strikes the boards, crying 
"yehee," drawing out the last syllable as long as possible. Then the 
people strike the boards all at the same time and repeat his cry. 

The master of ceremonies goes around the fire the fourth time, and 
when he reaches the rear of the house, he turns and cries " wowowo " or 
"woe'p." Then the people beat time and say "kf" (the f drawn out 
very long). This is the sound of Hai'alik'ila. During this time the 
whistles of the ghosts are heard continuously. 

When the master of ceremonies turns the last time, he smiles at the 
people, strikes the board, and cries " wo,'' to which all the people reply 
"hJia." The ceremonies of this evening are called IdL. 

Now the chief steps forward and says, "This is finished, friends; 
bring in your boxes." ^ While he remains standing, those people who 
are willing to bring boxes leave the house and soon return carrying 
them on their shoulders. The lids and ropes of the boxes are thrown 
into the fire. The boxes are placed in a row in the rear of the house, the 
openings turning backward. Then the ye'wix-ila asks one of his rela- 
tives or his daughter to dance. He holds a large staffin his hand, which 
is called qa/sop'eq or " feast staff." He promises to celebrate the winter 
dance; and calling up his father-in-law says that he was compelled to

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 541 

celebrate the winter dance without having had previous knowledge of 
what was coming, and re<iuests his father-in-law to rejiay him for the 
l)roperty with which he was presented at the time of the marriage of 
his daughter. The father-in-law rises, asks the young man to give 
him the staff, wliich he grasps in the middle, holding it horizontally. 
Then he calls his friends to take hold of the staff with him. By doing 
so they pledge themselves to help the old man to repay his son-in-law. 
He says how much he is going to pay to his son-in-law and returns the 
staff to him. Then the latter takes it and carries it, pretending that it 
it is exceedingly heavy, saying, "o, o, o, o!" It is supposed that the 
property is attached to the staff. 

The father-in-law asks: " When will you want me to pay you all this 
property ? " And the young man says that he wants it by the third day. 
The following days the people are invited to feast and to dance in the 
chief's house. A sail is stretched across the rear of the house. The 
seal society have their seats close to this sail. 

Now the master of ceremonies rises and calls one man (the ma'mE- 
nats'enox), whose office it is to look after the drum. This office is 
hereditary. The master of ceremonies says: "Go and bring your 
inheritance." The man rises, steps up to the fire, goes around it, leaves 
the house, and soon returns carrying the drum on his shoulder. He 
stops in the doorway, turns around silently, and walks around the fire 
four times. He stops finally in the left-hand rear corner of the house, 
where he puts down the drum on its flat side. He carries a small 
whistle in his mouth and every time he pushes the drum he blows the 
whistle. It is of course supposed that this sound is produced by the 
drum. Then he says, ''It is done; I have brought my inheritance." 
The master of ceremonies asks, "Did you bring the baton with you?" 
To which the man replies, " My grandfather has been dead so long- 
that I forgot this part of my inheritance." He is sent to fetch it, and 
walks out of the house and returns in the same way as the first time. 
He deposits the batons in the middle of the rear of the house, and 
every tinu^, he moves them he blows another whistle. 

Then the master of ceremonies calls another man, whose office it is 
to look after the eagle down. This office is also hereditary. He goes 
out in the same way as the other officer, and soon returns, carrying a 
painted l>ag filled with down. He says, "Here is the bag which my 
grandfather left for me to take care of." He walks around the fire 
four times, turning in the front and in the rear, and finally deposits it 
in the right hand front corner of the house. Then four men take four 
dishes, each takes one handful of down out of the bag, and puts it into 
the dish. The down is pulled apart so that it fills the dishes entirely. 
The owner of the down shakes his bag, which then appears to be 
quite full again, and carries it back. It is supj)osed that the bag 
always remains full. Then the master of ceremonies takes up one of 
the dishes and asks his brother, who is chief of the que'qutsa, to take 



542 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

another one. Tlie name of this office is da'sqame xa kue'xalak", holder 
of the kue'xalak". The officer has the name Q'E'mtq'atas.^ Two other 
men take the other two dishes and they walk around the fire once. 
Then they begin to strew the down on the heads of the people. The 
master of ceremonies begins either with the ha'mshamtsEs or with the 
bear-fool dancers (iiE'nq'oLEla) (see p. 499 No. 16). Then he gives eagle 
down to the fool dancers and to all the other dancers. 

Then the master of ceremonies goes around the fire again, swinging 
the baton. He stops in the rear of the house and strikes a box. All the 
people imitate him. Then a number of women, who are hired for the 
purpose, begin to dance. The jjeople sing one song for each of the 
women. After this dance the chief of the que'qutsa promises a feast 
for the next day, and the people go home. 

The next morning a number of que'qutsa go around from house to 
house to invite the i)eople for the feast. The same women who danced 
the first night, dance this evening. Again a feast is announced for 
the following day. On this day all the dancers who are allowed to 
wear masks enter first and arrange themselves behind the sail, wearing 
their masks. Then the people enter, last of all the master of cere- 
monies, wearing his cedar bark ring, his face painted red. Again he 
swings his stick from the elbow, turns in the house, and says " woi woi," 
and strikes the box. Then all the people beat the boxes for about ten 
minutes. Suddenly the master of ceremonies stretches out his arm 
and swings the baton slowly all around. The people stoi) beating time 
at once. He continues swinging his baton, and swings it faster and 
faster. Finally he beats the box again, and again all the peoi)le begin 
to beat time. Now the dancers are heard behind the curtain, each with 
his peculiar sound. The curtain begins to shake and is lowered, all 
the masks standing behind it. This is the end of the celebration of 
the third night. Again a feast is promised for the next day. This 
evening the same ceremony is repeated, but after all the masks have 
appeared in the rear of the house, the young person who had disap- 
peared in the beginning of the ceremonies comes out from the right 
hand rear corner of the house. He sings his new song and dances. 
Then his father brings out all the property given to him by his father- 
in-law and distributes it among the people. Bracelets, copp?,rs, and 
spoons are given to the women and childien. Silver bracelets, kettles, 
and box covers are given to the men. Before the people go home the 
chief promises another feast. 

The following day the people assemble again, and a feast is cele- 
brated, in which everybody takes part. Before they begin to eat, the 
host brings all the button blankets which he has received from his 
father-in-law and distributes them. The women receive white blankets.

but, instead of feeding them, only taught them four songs. The name means, eating

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 543 

Tliis is called a present to wipe the mouth with (da'yaxstano). Each 
person receives oue dish and si)oons, which they take home after the 
feast. After this feast the novice receives his name. Then the people 
leave the house. The purification of the novice is performed in the 
same way as described above (see p. 532), 

Sometimes the li;ue/xalak" begins with a curious contest between the 
ts'e'tsaeqa and the profane. This ceremony is used by the Kwakiutl, 
Ma'maleleqala, Mmkish, Lau'itsis, T'Eua'xtax, Ts'a/watEenox, Axua'- 
mis, Qoe'xsot'enox. The tribes forming the Newettee and Koslvimo 
group use the ghost dance in its place. Mr. George Hunt told me the 
following instance of the performance of this ceremony: 

The Q'o'mk'utis, Walas Kwakiutl, and Kue/xa had celebrated the 
ts'e'tsaeqa without inviting the Gue'tEla, the highest of the Kwakiutl 
tribes. Then the chief of the last-named tribe called all his people 
together into his house. He put u]) a long pole, the " winter dance x)ole," 
leaning it against the beam of his house, and asked his people, "Are 
you glad to hear the winter dance going on at the other end of our vil- 
lage while you are asleep in your houses f If you want to remain 
ba/xus, do so. If you want to join the winter dance, then one of you 
step up and touch this pole." As nobody stepped up to touch thei>ole 
he put his hand on it himself and said : " I will be the ye'wix'ila; but 
first let us all turn ourselves into dogs" (wa'tse; in the ordinary lan- 
guage, wao'tse). Then all his people took oft' their clothing, even their 
earrings and anklets, the women keeping only a small iDCtticoat. 
They blackened their faces and hands and painted men's and dogs' 
faces all over their bodies. Then they cut the winter dance pole in 
pieces about a fathom in length each. The chief ordered them to cut a 
hole in the rear wall of the house. After this was done, they went out 
secretly and from the rear approached the house in which the other 
tribes were celebrating their winter dance. Then tliey barked like dogs, 
broke through the rear wall of the house, and drove out all the dancers, 
including even the ha'mats'a. They broke the canoes and all the 
belongings of the dancers. This was their revenge for not being 
invited to the festival. This ceremony is called wii'ts'axt, which means, 
dogs running from one house to the other. 

Now the ts'et'saeqa assembled on one side of the street, while the 
"dogs" or the ba/xus assembled opposite them. The chief of the 
Gue'tEla, standing in front of his tribe, asked theye'wix-ila of the other 
tribes, "Can you throw the supernatural power among us?" Then the 
ts'e'tsaeqa began to beat time, the que'qutsa and mr^'emqoat all stand- 
ing together. Then the t'd'X'uit with the frog stepped out from among 
the ts'e'tsaeqa and danced like the ma/maqa, trying to catch his super- 
natural power. After some time she apparently caught it in her hands 
and threw it against the "dogs." The first throwing is called the 
daE'lk" (dEdfi/LElaL, Newettee dialect), which means laughing. The 
dogs laugh and bark all at the same time. 



544 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Then the ts'et'saeqa beat time again. Again the dancer caught his 
supernatural power, went four times forward and backward, turned 
around, and threw it against the dogs. Then they sat down, still laugh- 
ing, and began to scratch their heads. Again they barked. The 
ts'e'tsaeqa beat time for a third time, and the dancer caught the super- 
natural power again. She went forward and backward with ({uick steps, 
turned around, and threw it again. Then the dogs rushed into the 
water, scratching and rubbing their bodies, which means that they are 
removing the ba'xus from their bodies. They barked and came out 
again. 

Now the que'qutsa of tlie other tribes assembled in a group by them- 
selves and sent four men to the dogs, apparently to send some message, 
but actually in order to carry to them some red cedar bark. After they 
had returned, the dogs in their turn sent four of their number to fetch 
some more cedar bark. This is repeated four times, and is called 
ts'a'ts'exsila — that is, pretending to carry messages. 

Now the chief of the que'qutsa spoke to his people : " Take care ; don't 
give in, and remain what you are." All his people arose. Then the 
que'qutsa beat time again, and the dancer continued her dance. Sud- 
denly she was seen to hold red cedar bark in her hands. Four times 
she went backward and forward holding the cedar bark and moving her 
hands up and down. She turned four times, and every time stretched 
her hands out as though she was going to throw the cedar bark against 
the "dogs." The fourth time she really threw it. Then all the people 
stooped, and when they arose again they had cedar bark rings on their 
heads. 

Then the hamats'a, nfi'LmaL, na'ne, and the other me'emqoat of the 
Gue'tEla began to get excited. The chief pushed his son toward them. 
They surrounded him and dragged him around until all of a sudden he 
disappeared. Then it was said that the supernatural power had taken 
him away from the hfi'mats'a. This novice was now kue'xalak". The 
chief next invited all the "dogs" and the ts'e'tsaeqa into his house and 
annou iced that after four days he was going to try to bring the novice 
back. This is called wa'sdana qap'^'k", or short assembly, and takes 
the place of the ([ap'e'k" ceremony described above. The kue'xalak" 
then continues as described before. 

X. The Winter Ceremonial at Fort Rupert, 1895-96. 

Ill the preceding chapter I have given a general description of the 
ceremonial of the initiation of a single novice. When the ceremony is 
actually in i)rogress, there are several novices to be initiated, feasts are 
being held, and numerous incidental ceremonies are performed which 
depend upon circumstances, such as atonement for mistakes, rivalry 
between chiefs, and so forth. In order to make clear the character of 
the ceremonial, I will describe in the present chapter the ceremonial as 
it actually took place and So far as I witnessed it in the winter of 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 545 

1895-9G. At tliJit time three tribes Lad iissembled at Fort Eui)ert 
(Tsil/xis) — tbe Kwakiutl, the Koskimo, and Na'q'oaqtoq. Tbe Kos- 
kimo included also the G-d'p'enox, L'a'sq'enox, and Gua'ts'enox, I 
reached Fort Eupert on November 15, 1895, and shall record here what 
I saw. 

On the 16th of November one of the ISTfi'q'oaqtoq gave a feast. The 
Kwakiutl had their seats in the rear of the house, the Koskimo at the 
right hand side, the Na'q'oaqtoq on the left hand side. When all had 
assembled, the chief speaker of the Kil'q'oaqtoq said: ''Welcome, 
friends. Now that you have all come in, take the handles of your 
batons and sing.'" Then the batons were distributed. Planks were 
laid for beating time. While the people were still coming in, one of 
the que/tsEui (que'qutsaj began to tease a fool dancer, who intended 
to give up his dance and to become a que'qutsa. He pulled his nose, 
rubbed it with snow, and threw snowballs at it. As stated before, 
the fool dancer is supposed to have a long nose, and to resent all allu- 
sions to the nose. He does not allow it to be touched. The quc'qutsa 
tried in this manner to excite him so as to prevent him from leaving 
the seal society and becoming a que/qutsa. Finally, a number of 
quc'qutsa joined the first que/tsEm. They pulled the nose of the fool 
dancer, spat on it, and smeared it with grease, notwithstanding his 
endeavors to escape them. Finally, they tied him to one of the house 
posts and continued to maltreat his nose. Now the Kwakiutl sang 
two songs. They were followed by the Koskimo, who sang two songs 
in their turn. Meanwhile the meal, which consisted of soap- berries, 
had been prepared, and the speaker held u]> a dish which was intended 
for tlie iirst hiVmats'a. He shouted: "This is the dish of Yaqois."^ 
The dish was carried to him. The members of the seal society re- 
ceived their shares in order, next the women, and finally the que'- 
qutsa. Now the host turned to the fool dancer who was tied to the 
post, and wliom the people were teasing again. He said: "I will ask 
your friends to stay at their x)liices for a little while because I am 
cooking for you, and wish to feed you." Then several of the fool dan- 
cers came to his assistance. They licked the grease off from his nose, 
untied him, and took him back to his seat. As soon as the dishes were 
distributed, the host's assistants began to prejiare the second course, 
which consisted of rice. While the people were eating, the different 
societies uttered their cries: 

"The hens are pecking!"-' 

"The great seals keep on chewing."''

"The food of tlie gfreat killer whales is sweet.'' ^ 

"The food of the foolish boys is sweet." ^ 

"The great rock cods are trying to get food."^ 

"The great sea lions throw their heads downwards."* 

The Mosmos said: " It will be awful." ^ 

When utteriug these cries, the members of the societies lifted their 
spoons and seemed to enjoy the fun. Next, the Koskimo (tribe) lifted 
their si)oons and all cried "yfi." Then they ate as quickly as they could, 
and all the different que'qutsa- societies vied with each other, singing 
all at the same time. 

Next, a man arose who acted as though he was a Haida. He 
delivered a speech, during which he made violent gestures, imitating 
the sound of the Haida language. An interpreter who stood next to 
him translated the pretended meaning of his si)eech, which was sup- 
posed to be of the nature of thanks to the host for the soap berries, 
because they were one of the principal food articles of the Haida, and 
because the speaker was pleased to eat the kind of food to which he 
was accustomed in his own country. He continued, saying that he 
carried a box filled with food which he was going to give to the person 
who would pronounce his name. Then the host's daughter was called 
upon, and was asked to say his name. He began, G-a'tso, which she 
repeated; Se/as, which she also repeated; then followed, spoken very 
rapidly, Qoaga/ii Gustate/n Gusgitate'n Gusoa't Qoag'c'ns Qaqa/xsl.i.'^ 
Then she said: "lean not say this; I must go to school in order to 
learn it." The Haida asked her to go to school with him for tour 
nights; then she would know it. The girl's father interrupted them, 
saying that he wanted to wash his daughter before she went to school 
with him. 

Now the Kwakiutl and the Koskimo sang two songs each, before the 
rice was dished out. After the songs the host's father-in-law, who had 
contributed the rice for the feast, spoke as follows : " O, friends ! I have 
not finished giving food for the marriage of my son-in-law to my 
daughter;" and turning to his son-in-law, he continued: "Don't say 
that word. Don't refuse my kind offer, else I shall be ashamed. I do 
not do the same as other people, who only pretend to give fe^ists, giv- 
ing only to those who have to buy my property Irom me."^

While the rice was being eaten a man arose and announced that he 
was going to buy a copper from E'wanuXtse. The latter replied, but 
iu his speech he made a mistake, naming the summer name of a person. 
He was interrupted at once and compelled to sit down. 

November 18. — In the morning the Kwakiutl assembled in their 
secret meeting j)lace in the woods. A new bear dancer and fool dancer 
were to be initiated in the evening and the plan of the festival was 
laid out. At the same time the song makers taught the people the 
four new songs which the father of the new bear dancer had bought 
from them, and which were to be sung in the evening. Then -c)a'lSaxola, 
who was going to give the dance, made the following speech: 

"I*^ow come, my tribe, come Nu'xnemis, come Ho'LElite, come 
LE'mg-ala, x*i'xak"ala, and Nenau'alakuela. Now I will make my speech 
on this place of my friends. I will let you know my heart, friends. 
We will begin to beat the boards this night. You shall begin the 
songs, De'mis, and you Waxsganulisax, and you NaXualTsax, you 
song makers. That, Ts'a'qame and Go'koayu, is all that we say to our 
friends." 

Then NE'msqemiit arose and answered: "I am the one who was 
struck by the words of our friend." All the men who were sitting on 
the ground, said: "Goon!" He continued: "Now come! Listen to 
the speech of our friend on this ground and take care else the secret of 
our song makers will be known. I say this, Nu'xnemis and Ho'LElite. 
Take care, friends. I say this, LE'mg-ala, I say this, x'i'xak-ala." 

Then the song makers sung and put words into the old songs. Now 
the song maker linished. Then the men who gave the ceremonial told 
how many dancers there were to be and how many songs. Now he 
finished. Then the song maker took as many sticks as there were to 
be dancers, and gave them to him. Then the man who gave the cere- 
monial named each dancer and said : "This will be the song of Ga'yax- 
stalasas," and pushed one stick into the ground. Then he called the 
name of another one and put a stick into the ground. He put down as 
many sticks as there were women who were to dance. 

When he had spoken, LE'mg-ala arose and asked his tribe: "How 
will you dress r' The chief of the killer whales, Qil'quLayi, arose and 
said he would go with his friends, and the chief of the policemen, Gu'- 
kwayu, arose and said he would go with his men and they would dress. 
LE'mg-ala was standing all the time while the people were speaking. 
After they had finished, he said: Now, Qa'quLayi, now Gii'kwayu, 
you have finished your speeches. 1 thank you. Why should you be

ashamed, frieiulsf We do not ueed to be ashamed of what we are 
doing here in the woods." 

He continued: "Now take care, members of the seal society! put on 
your painting of charcoal. Take good care of what we are doing in the 
house; if anything should happen to one of our masks you must get 
excited. Wa, wa!" 

After their return they were invited by one man of the tribe to a seal 
feast in which the Na'q'oaqtoq and Koskimo did not take part, because 
seal feasts are considered a privilege of the noblest tribe, namely, the 
Kwakiutl. The seal was singed and boiled. Then the skin with the 
adhering blubber was cut spirally all around the body, and handed to 
the men who stood up all around the house. They received about a 
yard of blubber each. Then the host made a short speech; and after 
the four feast songs were sung, they all fell to. After the blubber was 
dispatched, the meat was distributed in dishes and eaten. 

In the evening the father of the new bear dancer gave a feast. The 
Kwakiutl sat in the rear of the house, the Koskimo on the left hand 
side on entering, the Na/q'oaqtoq on the right hand side. When all 
had entered, the members of the seal society came in— first the bears 
dressed in button blankets. They had bears' paws on their hands, put 
on likemittens. They remained standing in the door and looked around 
wildly. The next to enter was the Ts'O'nOqoa, who, according to the 
tradition, is sleeping all the time. She had her eyes closed and attempted 
to go to the rear of the house, turning to the left, while the customary 
circuit is to the right. One of the messengers who was stationed in the 
door took her by the arm and led her to the right. A rope was stretched 
from the door to her place, along which she walked to her seat in the 
rear of the house, feeling her way by means of the rope. The next to 
enter were the fool dancers. While they were going to the rear of the 
house a loud noise was heard outside. They pretended to be afraid, 
hid their faces among the people, and hastened to their seats ia the 
rear of the house. The noise came nearer, the door opened, and in 
came the killer whales, young men and boys, dressed in blankets and 
having long carved fins attached to their backs. Some of these consisted 
of a sheath in which a carved board was placed so that it could be pulled 
out and dropped back by means of strings, thus giving the appearance 
of a flu which was alternately lengthening and shortening. The men 
came in stooping down low, so that the fins stood upright. They blew 
like whales, turned in front of the fire, and slowly went to the rear of 
the house, leaving the fire to their lelt, stopping and blowing on their 
way. After they had made one circuit they disappeared again. Next, 
a number of people came in, spreading their blankets and imitating 
motions and voices of ducks. They went to the rear of the house. As 
soon as all had assembled the people began to sing. Suddenly a man 
holding his young son on his arms rushed out of the right hand rear 
corner of the house, ran around the fire uttering the cries of the nu'L- 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 549 

maL "lii, lii, lii, lii!" and pushing right and left with a dagger which 
he was carrying. At the same time he smeared his son's face with the 
mucus of his nose, thus " imbuing him with the sacred madness of the 
nfi'LmaL." The poor cliild was frightened, and cried piteously during 
the ceremony. This was his initiation in the nu'LmaL society. It 
happened during an interval between the four songs which were sung 
before the meal. 

After the people had eaten, the bear rushed out of the same corner 
whence the fool dancer had come. He was dressed in a bear skin and 
came out on all fours, pawing the ground, growling, and looking wildly 
upon the spectators. The people began to sing the first of his new 
songs, and eighteen women danced accompanying the song, in order 
to appease his holy wratli. The songs pacified him, and he disappeared 
again in the corner of the house from which he had come and where 
he is supposed to be initiated. After this the second course was served, 
and then the i)eople dispersed, each lighting his torch and wending 
his way home along the dark street or down along the beach and up 
the narrow bridges which cross the stream leading from the beach to 
the street. Soon the glimmering lights disappeared in the houses, 
where the fires were tended before everybody went to his bedroom to 
enjoy the rest. 

On the 19th of November the first hfi'mats'a gave a feast of salmon 
and berries. Early in the morning he himself, accompanied by the seal 
society, went from house to house, their faces blackened, and dressed 
in their various ornaments — the fool dancers with their lances, the 
bears with their enormous paws. The fool dancers knocked at the 
doors with their lances. Then they entered and invited the people with 
the same words as are used at ordinary occasions. But they did not 
raise their Aoices; they uttered the invitation in a low growling tone. 
Whenever the name of a person was mentioned the meaning of which 
in some way offended the bears, they jiushed the speaker — one of the 
fool dancers — so that he almost fell down. While the names were 
being called, the members of the seal society looked around angrily. 

Generally four calls are necessary to convene the people, but the 
seals do not allow them to tarry. After they had called the first 
time, they went around apparently offended by the tardiness of the 
people. They carried a long rope, entered the houses, and the fool 
dancers pushed the people from their seats with their lances. The 
bear dancers scratched them and drove tliem towards the rope, which 
was stretched tightly. Then the members of the society who held the 
rope pushed the people out of the house on to the street. After hav- 
ing arrived on the street, they drove them before the rope until they 
reached the dancing house. Thus it did not take very long to bring 
the peoi)le together. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon they began their 
second call, and at 4.30 p. m. all the people were assembled. As the 
host belonged to the Kwakiutl tribe, the Koskimo and the Na'q'oaqtoq

had the seat of lionor in tlie rear of the house where the seal society 
is generally sitting. The Kwakiutl sat to the right and to the left of 
the door. The members of the seal society and the relatives of the 
host were standing near the door tending the fire and preparing the 
food. As soon as all the people were assembled, the seals placed two 
logs in front of the door, over which they laid a plank. The ha'mats'a 
and two fool dancers took their seats on the plank, thus preventing 
any of the guests from leaving the house. 

About this time IlryLElitc, the speaker of the Gue/tEla, arose and 
asked his debtors to pay his debts.' He said: "J^ow I beg you to 
please me and to pay my humble debts ;^ then calling the names of 
those whose debts were due. One of the latter arose and promised 
that all would pay on the following day. These debts had been con- 
tracted a year before the feast, and therefore became due by this time. 

IIo'LElite continued speaking. In behalf of the seal society he 
thanked the people that they had come to the feast. He called up four 
men to distribute eagle down. Then they took up the down, which was 
placed in four dishes, and put it on to the heads of the assembly. Now 
he asked the people to sing and to beat time, and four young men 
distributed the batons. The seals continued preparing the food, while 
the Koskimo and Na'q'oaqtoq sang two songs each. The bears had 
their paws on; the fools carried their lances while they were prepar 
iug the food. One of the bear dancers was being led by a rope which 
was held by one of the fool dancers, in order to prevent him from get- 
ting excited and attacking the people. During their songs one of the 
Na/q'oaqtoq women danced in the rear of the house. 

After they had finished singing, the speaker of the Na'(j'oaqt6q arose 
and said: "The Kwakiutl do not look proi)erly after the winter cere- 
monial. But now they shall see that we know well how to arrange our 
ceremonials." He took off his head ring, called his cousin Qa'snomalas, 
and gave him the ring, asking him" to go around the fire and to look 
for someone who had no red cedar bark ornaments. Qfi/snomalas took 
the ring and went around the fire, turned once in front of the door, and 
continued his way to the rear of the house. There he put the ring 
around the neck of his cousin, NE'msqEmk-ala, who had just arrived 
from the Na'q'oaqtoq village, and who therefore had not taken part in the 
opening ceremonies, when everybody received his ornaments of bark. 
As soon as he had received the neck ring, he arose and danced as

ha'mslianitsEs. After lie had danced, his father, T'e't'esumx-tsana, arose 
and promised to distribute blankets. ISTE'msqEmk'ala's wife asked her 
speaker, Qoe'neqoiL, to speak for her. He held a silver bracelet in his 
hands and i^romised in her behalf that she would give to her husband 
four sticks of silver bracelets, ten bracelets to a stick, and button 
blankets as many as were needed for a festival which he was going 
to give. Then Qfi'snomalas took the blanket and T'e't'esumx-tsana took 
the bracelet. The latter spoke: " This is my way. Ko other clan can 
equal mine; no chief can equal me. I always distribute all my prop- 
erty." Then Qa'sndmalas interrupted him and said: " Don't say too 
much ! You have made me your speaker and taught me not to mind others 
in what I am doing. You have made me happy. Therefore I shall 
sing." Then he sang two songs which expressed his happiness. After 
his songs he said: "That is enough. I sing two songs for what you 
have promised me to-day. I shall sing four songs when you will 
promise me a copper." He thanked his uncle's wife for considering (he 
noble position of her husband and helping him to keep that position. He 
announced that he would distribute the bracelets and button blankets 
among the four tribes of the Kwakiutl. " Ya Koskimo," he said, "fol- 
low this way, follow my way. Don't lock up your boxes ; keep them 
open as I do. Thus 1 have become higher than any other man. I 
always put my property into a box with red-hot bottom.' Let both our 
tribes strive against the Kwakiutl, so that we may take off" two finger 
widths of their highness." ^ 

By tliis time the salmon was done and was put into long flat dishes 
and fish oil x>oured upon it. The fool dancers and bear dancers 
distributed the dishes and the wooden spoons, every three or four 
people receiving one dish. The Koskimo and Nii'q'oaqtoq were given 
first, the Kwakiutl last. Etiquette demands that the guests eat as 
quickly as possible. Whenever the bear dancers and fool dancers saw 
a person eating slowly, they went up to him and pushed and scratched 
him. During all this time a huge tire was being kept up in the middle 
of tlie house and grease was poured into it. The flames leaped up to 
the roof of the house, which every now and then caught fire, so that a 
man had to be sent up to extinguish it. It is considered improper for 
the guests to mind such fires, and aj)parently no notice is taken of 
them until the host deems it proper to send up to the roof. He some- 
times disregards the tire until it has attained quite considerable dimen- 
sions. 

As soon as the people had finished eating, the chief fool dancer, who 
is the speaker of the ha'mats'a, tried to deliver a speech. But it is 

'That means, as water is scattered by being poured upon red-Jiot stones, thus his 
blankets are scattered among the tribes as soon as they fall upon the red-liot bottom 
of his box. 

^The Kwakiutl arc^ counted as high as four linger widths, as they consist of four 
tribes. The other tribes are each ouly one tiuger width high. Of these, theN:i'q"oaqt6q 
and Koskimo wanted to have each one, in order to become as high as the Kwakiutl. 



652 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

customary to interrupt him. Whenever he made an attempt to speak, 
the people raised a great din, which compelled him to stop. He pre- 
tended to get angry and threw stones at the people. At this time he 
ordered the members of the seal society, of wliich he himself is a mem- 
ber, not to eat of the salmon, as a number of fish were set aside for 
them. When a number of fool dancers and bears began to eat, not- 
withstanding his commands, some of the other members of the seal 
society took the food away and pulled them back. After all the gnests 
had eaten, a large dish was placed on the i^lank which was laid in front 
of the door. The hii'mats'a ate out of the dish, while the other mem- 
bers of the seal society ate out of large kettles which were standing 
near the lire. Then all the people laughed at them because they ate 
after the others had finished, although they are the highest in rank 
among the whole tribe and ordinarily receive their share first. When 
the people were teasing them, the friends of some of the members of 
the seal society stepped before them, spreading their blankets, thus 
hiding them from view, so that the peoj^le should not see them eating. 

Now Ho'LElitc arose again and spoke: '' This is the way of my chief. 
He gives a large feast on account of the nobility of my tribe." He 
asked the people to take the batons and to sing. The Nfi'q'oaqtoq 
commenced and sang two songs. The Koskimo followed with four 
songs. In the fourth song the word " raven" occurred. As soon as it 
was heard, one of the ha/mats'as of the Koskimo became excited. He 
jumped up, crying "hap, hap, hap," trembling all over his body. His 
attendants rushed up to him, the people beat time violently, and the 
drummer beat the drum, while the ha/mats'a tried to rush up to the 
people and to bite them. But he was held back by his six attendants. 
Slowly he moved to the rear of the house, where he went once to the 
left, once to the ri^iit, then continuing his course around the fire. 
When he came to the door, he went out, followed by his attendants. 
Then the Koskimo called four times, " yu !" 

While this was going on, ]!^Eg*e'ts'e, speaker of the Koskimo, arose, 
and as soon as quiet was restored, he spoke: "Take care, my tribe; 
the supernatural power has entered our ha/mats'a Nau'aqis;" and turn- 
ing to the Kwakiutl, he said: " Be ready, friends, you on both sides of 
the house; we will try to tame our ha/mats'a." This was said at the 
moment when the ha'mats'a ran out of the door. His attendants 
returned after an absence of about ten minutes. 

Now a number of large carved dishes were brought in, one repre- 
senting a bear, the other a sea lion, and others otlier animals. They 
were placed in a row in front of the fire. Then Ho'LElite arose again 
and with him AmA/x-idayu, an old speaker of the Gue'tEla. Ho'LElite 
spoke, calling the host's ba/xus name, NEmo'gwis, and pointing to the 
bear dish said: "This is NEmo'gwis's dish, which was used by the first 
NEuio'gwis when he gave a grease feast. He used a dish like this one. 
He also used this second bear dish and a wolf dish and a killer whale

disli/' Tlieu be called up No'Lq'auLEhi, the lather of NEino'gwis. 
" Speak yourself regarding your own dishes." N^o'Lq'auLEla called up 
his mother, Mo'sqEniXLala. He asked her to give to his son some of 
her father's dishes. Then she pointed out a bear dish and a dish repre- 
senting the sea lion's stomach. He continued, asking her for some of 
her mother's dishes. Then she pointed to a killer whale dish and to a 
wolf dish. He spoke: "Friends, my mother has some more carvings, 
but I do not want to give them to my son as yet. First I want to give 
another feast; then I shall give them to my successor. That is all." 

Then HO'LElitil spoke again: "Did you hear what my chief said? 
He said that he wants to use the dishes before giving them to his son. 
That means he is going to give another feast. Hu, hu, hu, hu, hu," 
and all the people repeated this cry. The fool dancers and bear dancers 
took the dishes and carried them to the guests. Hd'LElite called: 
"This is the dish of the troublesome ones.^ This is the dish of Ts'e- 
qolag-ilis.2 This is the dish of the cormorants.'' This- is the dish of the 
rock cods and bears.^ This is the dish of the whales for whom one 
waits.'' This is the dish of the gulls.*^ This is the dish of the pigs.""^ 

After all the large dishes had been distributed, the small dishes were 
carried to the women and to the young i)eople. While all were eating, 
Ho'LElite remained standing and asked the Kwakintl to sing. They 
assembled in the door, and after having placed a plank on two logs 
they sang, standing, the feast song of the winter dance. As NEmog'wis 
had no daughter, his grandmother and his father danced, accompanying 
the song. 

After they had finished singing, Ho'LElite spoke: " Ya, friends, this 
is the way of my chief. He does so not only this time to show his great- 
ness, but he always acts this way. Eat and swallow what is given to 
you as well as you can; eat it all. Bring our food and we will feed the 
chiefs." Then the members of the seal society brought a barrel filled 
with berries and placed it in front of Ho'LElite. While carrying it they 
cried, "u, u, u, u, u," indicating that the barrel was exceedingly heavy. 
Then they brought a number of large wooden ladles. Ho'LElite dipped 
berries out of the barrel, and said, "Now sip, Xfi'msqEmk-ala,'"* and the 
ladle was taken to him. He drank, and when he was unable to empty 
it he poured the rest of the food into his dish. Thus the ladles were 
carried to all the chiefs. After all had received their share, Ho'LElite 
spoke: "Oh, tribes! I do not do so once only; T often give feasts of this 
kind. That is why we are called Kwakintl — that means the smoke of 

'Wu'n'awnnx'is, the society of the Na'q'oaqtoq, which embraces the secret socie-

the world. All tlie tribes try to Imitate us, but I have not seen anyone 
who has been able to do as we do." Then all the people said, " True, 
true!" Next NEmo'gwis's father, No'Lq'auLEla, spoke: " Look at me; 
look at my son ! You shall not call me chief on account of what I am 
doing, but call my son chief, because I am doing it for his sake. I am 
working for him; I want to make him heavier all the time."' Then he 
asked one of the Nfi'q'oaqtoq chiefs, who had expressed his intention to 
leave, " Is it true that you are going to leave 1 If you intend to do so, 
wait four days longer, because my brother is going to give away 
blankets within a few days," and he continued : " Ma'maleleqala ! my 
son is ready for you. He intends to give blankets to you. My brother- 
in-law KuLE'm is also ready for you, and Afi'listalitsa intends to give 
blankets to you." Then the Na'q'oaqtoq, who intended to leave, arose 
and said : " I wish there were two men like you in Tsa'xis (Fort Eupert). 
You are the iirst who treated me well; you who asked me to stay here," 
Novemher 20. — In the afternoon the Koskimo sent their messengers to 
invite to a feast. About 6 p. m. the people had assembled in their 
dancing house. First a Na/q'oaqtoq distributed blankets among the peo- 
ple, and then one of their number arose, holding a copper in his hands. 
He spoke about its value, and said that he was going to buy it. Sud- 
denly whistles and noise were heard outside, and the Koskimo ha/mats'a, 
who had disappeared the preceding night, entered, accompanied by his 
attendants. He danced around the fire once and disappeared again. 
Then the speaker of the Koskimo asked the Kwakiutl and theNa/q'oaqtoq 
to sing. The Kwakiutl sang their two songs. The Na'q'oaqtoq followed, 
but when in their first song they got out of time Ya/qois, the principal 
hamats'a of the Kwakiutl, got excited. He jumped up, crying "hap, 
Inlp, hap." His nine attendants rushed up to him, and while he was 
trembling violently they moved once to the right, once to the left behind 
the fire, then around the tire, and when they reached the door, they 
went out. During all this time whistles were heard proceeding from 
the circle of the attendants. While the Koskimo chief was continuing 
his speech the whistles and the howling of the ha'mats'a was heard on 
the street. Soon he returned, dressed only with a dancing apron, two 
rings of cedar bark worn crosswise over his shoulders, and a heavy ring 
of red cedar bark worn on his head. The first circuit he danced in a 
squatting posture. When opposite the door, he was for a short time 
carried by his attendants. In the rear of the house he turned once. 
The second circuit he danced standing, and tlie songs which were sung 
during this time were in a five-part measure. His feet were put down 
with the beats of the batons. The knees were lifted high up for each 
step, while the trunk moved downward at the same time. After he 
had gone around the fire twice, his father dressed him with a fine Chilcat 
blanket and an apron and leggins of the same make, with which he 
made two more circuits around the fire. Then he disappeared, utterly 

' That means he wants to make his ornaments of red cedar bark more valuable. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 555 

exhausted, in one of the small bedrooms. During the dance he had 
apparently become quieter and quieter as time went on. Then Ta'qois's 
father arose and distributed a few blankets which had been fetched 
during the dance of the ha'mats'a. They were given as an earnest of 
the blankets with which he promised to jiay for the ecstasy of his son. 

Now at last the Koskimo began to prepare the feast. While they 
were engaged in this work, one of them shouted, all of a sudden: 
'^Listen! What is going on outside?" Everyone was quiet, and sud- 
denly the roof of the house shook violently. At the same time a boy 
was seen in the entrance of the house being wafted up and down. He 
hung perfectly limp while he was flying to and fro. Then the people 
pressed up to him and placed themselves so that the boy was in the 
dark. Suddenly he had disappeared. After a short time his bloody 
clothing and his head ring of red cedar bark fell down through the 
roof, and a short time after the bloody clothing of a girl also fell down. 
Then the speaker of the Koskimo said: "Three of our youths have 
been taken away by the spirits. Now our winter ceremonial shall be- 
gin." Great excitement prevailed, as this was quite unexpected to the 
other tribes. Then food was distributed, during which time speeches 
of welcome and of thanks were made. This was the end of the festival. 

November 21. — Early in the morning the old hfi'mats'a of the Kos- 
kimo, with three attendants, was seen on the beach pursuing a number 
of women. It appears that they had taken some of the food that was 
intended for him, which had excited his wrath. He ran after them, 
trying to bite them, and they escaped into the water, which the 
ha/mats'a is supposed to dread. There he kept them for a long time; 
whenever they made an attempt to escape, he tried to bite them and 
drove them back. 

In tiie evening the father of Ya'qois gave the promised feast, in 
which he was going to pay for the ecstasy of his son. The blankets 
which he was about to distribute actually belonged to his mother- * 
When the people were assembled in the dancing house of the Kwakiutl, 
she came in first, crying "hu, htl, hu," which indicates the weight of 
the blankets which she was going to distribute. She was followed by 
the father of Ya'qois, who entered singing his secret song.' He was 
followed by his son Ta'qois, the ha'mats'a, and by his sister La'stosalas, 
who is the k-i'nqalaLala of the former. Then the members of his clan 
followed, carrying the blankets which he was going to distribute. 

The speaker of the clan Si'sinLae asose and said: "Look at me, 
friends, look at me well. This is my way of acting for my children." 
Then he turned to the Kwakiutl and said: *' Yes, my friends, here I am 
again. I can not let you rest, for we must try to pacify our great 
friend.^ Now arise ! and take the handles of your batons," and turning 
to the Na'q'oaqtoq and Koskimo, he asked them to help pacify the 



'He'lig'a ye'laqula. 

'Meaning the ha'mats'a Ya'qols, who became excited tLe preceding day. 



556 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

La'iiiats'a. He said : " We have tried to tame liim, but Ave can not do it. 
I am too insignificant as compared to liim." "True, true," said all the 
people. Then they began to sing: 

I have been all around the world eating with BaxbakualanuXsT wa 

I give nobody time to escape me, going around in the house with liaxbaknalanuX- 

si'wae. 
You BaxbakualanuXsT'wafi, center of the earth, you were crying hfip for nie; 
You BaxbakufilanuXsT'wae, post of the world, you were crying hfip for me.' 

Ya/qois and his k-i'nqalaLala danced, accompanying the song. First 
two songs were sung for the ha'mats'a, then two for the k-i'nqalaLala, 
one of which was as follows : 

I keep down your wrath, Great, real Cannibal ! 

I keep down your whistles, Great, real Cannibal! 

I keep down your A'oraciousness, Great, real Cannibal! 

You are always looking for food, Great, real Cannibal! 

You are always looking for heads. Great, real Cannibal! 

Y'ou are always devouring propertj^. Great, real Cannibal!'^ 

Til on the speaker of the Koskimo arose and said: "Ya, Koskimo! 
Ya, Kwakiutl, Ya, Na'q'oaqtoq. This here is my ha/mats'a.'' I sold a 
copper for 1,000 blankets and he swallowed it.^ I sold a copper for 
1,200 blankets and he swallowed it. At another time I bought a cop- 
per for 1,200 blankets and threw it into the fire for the sake of his 
name. Now look out! I may do the same again this year. I Avant to 
make him as heavy as I can on my part. His father is doing the same 
for him." Then Ya/qois's father arose and the people shouted : " Speak, 
Chief; speak yourself; not through a speaker."^ Thenliesaid: "Friends, 
look at me; look at me Avell, because 1 want to tell you who I am! 
This is my Avay of doing. Five years ago you heard much about Avhat 
I was doing. Then I gave my ha'mats'a first to Ya/qois. Ten times I 
gaA^e blankets to the Koskimo. I want you to come to my house ten 
.times this year, so that I may reach to the beams of my house. This is 
not my way of doing. Chief NEqa'penk-'Em, my father,'' and A'Avate 
taught me this way and I followed them. My name is rja/qoag-ila on 
account of the copper Avhich 1 had from my grandiather. My name is 
Qo'moqoe on account of the ermine and abalone shells Avhich I have 
from my grandfather. Do you Avant to know how 1 obtained my 
ha'mats'a? 1 opened my box and took out my dances, which I received 
from my brother-in-law, Q'uli's.'' Therefore I am not ashamed of my 
ha'mats'a. Now I ask you one thing — do not call me Gue'telabido." It

is well when I live like one of yon, and it is Avell if 1 act like one of the 
northern tribe, becanse my mother was of high blood among her tribe. 
I do not give this festival that you may call me a (,'hief. I give it in 
honor of these two who are dancing here, that the words of their ene- 
mies may not harm them. For this purpose I build an armor of wealth 
around them." Then his speaker continued: "Y<ni have finished. I 
am proud of you. Yours is the right way of speaking. There is 
nothing wrong in what you said." Then he turned to the Na/q'oaqtoq, 
addressing their chief, K-ak-x;Vlaso : "Did you hear what my chief 
said? He did not speak against you; he did not speak against the 
Koskimo, and lie did not speak against us. He shall be the speaker 
of the clan Se'uLEm.' Do not speak behind our backs, calling us 
sons of northern tribes.^ Our ha'mats'a is making us tired. Now 
take care! Look after your batons and speak carefully, and see that 
food is given in the proper way to our great friend. He has many 
fathers. If one of them has not enough property at hand, another 
one is ready to pay for his ecstasies. Ho'LElite ! Gome and do what 
you like with these blankets here. They fell from the red cedar bark 
of Ya'qois." 

Ho'LElite arose and with him Ama'x-idayu. He praised Nr/Lq'au- 
LEla, the father of Ya'qois, and said : " O Na'q'oaqtoq. This is the first 
time that such a thing is done. His property runs from him in streams, 
and if one of his rivals should stand in the way he would be drowned 
by it." 

Then he began to distribute the blankets, beginning with tbe ma/- 
maq'a of the Na'q'oaqtoq. Sometimes he did not know the proper 
order and rank of the different names. Then he inquired of the people, 
and they called to him, trying to help him. Some even threw stones at 
him in order to attract his attention. After the Ih'st pile of blankets 
had been distributed among the JSla'q'oaqtoq, he took up the second 
pile and distributed it among the Koskimo, beginning with their ha'- 
mats'a. After he had distributed all, he said once more: "Be careful; 
the supernatural power never leaves ourha/mats'a; if you should make 
a mistake, he will become excited again." After his speech, the Na'q'- 
oaqtoq and Koskimo sang a song on account of the distribution of 
blankets, and one of the Koskimo said: "I begin to be afraid of the 
manner in which we are being treated here. The property which is being 
distributed here reaches up to my throat. I will not blame Nd'Lq'auLEla. 
My grandson is a ha'mats'a, and neither he has received a blanket nor 
have I received one." It so happened that his name had been forgotten 
in the distribution. Then No'Lq'auLEla took the button blanket which 
his mother was wearing and gave it to the speaker, who thanked him for 
it. Next a ]Sra/q'oaqt«')q arose and said : "No clan has ever been known 
to do what you have done to-day, and I am afraid of you. Kwakiutl, 



'Or Si'sliiLae.

you had a chief before this time, but now you have uo chief." ^ Upon 
this all the Kwakiutl said: ''True, true; we can not deny 't."^ 

After these speeches were finished, food, which consisted of crab 
apples mixed with grease, was distributed among the guests."* When 
the people had almost finished eating, one of the Na'q'oaqtoq gave a 
button blanket to his son-in-law as a promise of a great number of 
blankets which he was to give him at a later time. Then the reci[)ient 
thanked his father-in law. He took his staff, which he held horizontally 
on his shoulder, and which he carried as though he was loaded down 
with the gifts of his father-in-law. Slowly he went around the fire 
singing his secret song — a t'o'X'uit song, as he was a member of that 
society. He turned when he came to the front of the house and when 
he reached the rear of the house. While he was still singing, all the 
Na'q'oaqtoq singers assembled near the door. They held a plank to 
beat time on and began to sing. The man danced while they sang. 
After the second song, he put on the button blanket and danced, 
accompanied by the third song. During the fourth song he took up some 
burning coals and laid them before one of the men. This was to indi- 
cate that he had j)ower over the fire. Then he took another piece of 
burning coal between his hands, rubbed it, and, swinging his closed 
hands forward and backward, he all of a, sudden threw them forward, 
and as they parted the coals had disappeared. He had transformed 
the coal into a supernatural object which was to fly around the whole 
world to see if there was a chief greater than his father-in-law. In 
four days he said it should return and bring him answer. Then he 
announced that he would keep the blanket which he had received, 
and that he would not give it away, and the people replied: "Do as 
you say." 

In the evening the Na/q'oaqtoq held their kue/xalak". When all the 
l^eople had assembled, the speaker thanked them that they had come, 
and turning to his own tribe, he said: "Keep your batons in readi- 
ness!" As soon as he had said so, the door opened and two men came 
in wearing large blankets and imitating the motions of cormorants. 
They entered by twos and threes and gathered in the rear of the house, 
standing in a row. When all had come in, the speaker asked the first 
of the birds: "What is in your stomach ? " Herejjlied: "Kwakiutl.'' 
Then he asked the next one : " What is in your stomach ? " He replied : 
"Four tribes," meaning the four tribes of the Kwakiutl. Turning to 
the third one, he asked: "What is in your stomach?" He rephed: 
"The Kwakiutl, the Koskimo, and all other tribes." When he asked 
the next one, he acted as though he was vomiting. This means that he 
was vomiting the property that was to be distributed at night. The 
fifth one said to the speaker that he had gone from tribe to tribe through 

' Meaning that No'Lq'aiiLEla, by his numerous distributions of blankets, had become 
greater than all the other chiefs.

the whole world swallowing- the tribes.' After the speaker had asked 
every one in this manner, he thanked the cormorants for coming, and 
said: "I am glad that you are not light cormorants, but that "ou are 
heavy with property." 

Another signal was given to the singers to beat time, and in came 
the killer whales. They also entered by twos and threes. They had 
fins made of wood tied to their backs, and came in blowing. They 
moved in a bent position, so that the fins stood upright. Blowing, they 
went around the fire, where they remained standing next to tlie cor- 
morants. Now the speaker said: "Do you know why we open our 
ceremonial with the entrance of the cormorants and of the killer 
whales? In olden times, when Kuekuaxa'oe traveled all over the world 
in his canoe Da'daLa, he came to Goil'LgoaL'a'Ialis, where the village 
of tlie Na'q'oa(itoq is standing. There the Na'q'oaqtoq and the killer 
whales were living at that time. Kuekuaxa'oe left them and went to 
Ya'xoestEm. After he had left, difficulties arose between the Na/q'oaq- 
toq and the killer whales. When Kuekuaxa'oe heard of this, he trans- 
formed part of the whales into birds, others into sand. For this reason 
the sand of the beach Goa'LgoaL'a'lalis is sounding when it is stepped 
upon." 

After he had finished his speech, the women came in, dressed as birds. 
They danced around the fire and stopped next to the cormorants and 
killer whales. Then tlie speaker continued : "Do you know what this 
means? The birds were living at Ya'xoestEm when Kuekuaxa'oe 
arrived there. They were living in a cave. Kuekuaxa'oe painted them 
different colors. The crows and the cormorants wanted to be made 
prettier than all the others, and waited until the last, but then they found 
that Kuekuaxa'oe had used all his paint and had only some charcoal 
left, with which he painted them. Therefore they are black. After the 
birds had been painted, they came dancing out of the cave. At that 
time Kuekuaxa'oe's canoe was burned. If you do not believe what I 
said, Koskimo, come and visit me and I will show you the place." 
After this speech, the Na'q'oaqtoq distributed their blankets among 
the Kwakiutl and Koskimo. 

After this was done, a messenger entered the house and said : " Some 
strangers are on the beach." Th-e speaker of the Ka'q'oaqtoq sent a 
man out, who took a torch and went down to the beach. Soon he 
returned and informed the speaker that some white men had landed 
aiul asked to be permitted to enter. The speaker sent for them, and the 
messengers came back leading a young Indian girl, who was dressed up 
in European costume, with a gaudy hat, a velvet skirt, and a silk blouse. 
Then they asked Ko'Lq'auLEla what he thought of her; if he thought 
she was wealthy. They asked him to send her back if she should be 
Ijoor. He looked at her and said: " I can easily distinguish rich and 
poor and I see she is wealthy. Let lier stay here." Then the speaker 

' That means giving away blankets. When blankets are given to a tribe, it ie 
called swallowing the tribe. 



560 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

looked iit her and said: "Oh, that is Mrs. Nu'R"'." Tliey led her to the 
rear of the house aud asked her if she carried anything in her pocket. 
She produced a roll of silver quarter dollars, which the speaker took 
and distributed among the people. By this time it was near midnight. 

Now the speaker said: "Let us take up the object of our conven- 
tion." The festival was to be the initiation of a new q'o'minaqa. 
About a fortnight before the festival the host's daughter, who was a 
q'o'minaqa, had died, and he wanted to let his niece take her place. 
The festival was to be her initiation. She had been hidden in a. secret 
room in the rear of the house, and when the singers began the songs of 
the dead girl she appeared wearing a blanket, dancing apron, a round 
neck ring, and a high head ring which was covered all over with down. 
She danced very slowly around the fire, accompanied by two attendants. 
Her hands trembled. They were held horizontally forward, lightly 
bent, her elbows resting on her sides. When she appeared, three 
women began to dance in the rear of the house in order to appease her. 
After four circuits she disappeared in her room, followed by her two 
attendants and the three dancers. When the second song was struck 
up, she reappeared and danced in the same manner as before. At the 
end of the song she went back to her room. During the third and 
fourth songs she grew quiet and danced like other women. When 
she appeared for the fourth time, she wore a huge round head ring. She 
was accompanied by an old woman, the aunt of the deceased girl, who 
wore no ornaments, and whose disheveled hair hung loosely over her 
face. This indicated that she was in deep mourning. 

Soon after the end of the ceremony the song of a man was heard in 
front of the house. He approached slowly. Now the door opened and 
a naked person, wearing only an apron, and a head ring of red cedar 
bark, arm rings, and anklets of the same material, ai)peared. He 
stayed in the doorway for a long time, singing his secret song. Then 
he came forward, looking upward, his hands laid Hat to the back side of 
his thighs. With short quick steps he ran around the lire. The audi- 
ence became restless, because they feared him, the ma/maq'a, the 
thrower of sickness. When he entered, all the hfi'mats'a had to leave 
the house. As soon as he began his circuit, a man holding a rattle ran 
up to him and followed all his movements. As soon as the ma'maq'a 
came to the rear of the house he gave a high jump. The drummer beat 
the drum rapidly and all of a sudden the ma'maq'a had caught his mag- 
ical stick, which he held between his palms, drawing it out long and 
shortening it again. Suddenly he threw it into himself. The staff had 
disappeared and he fell backward in frightful contortions. Blood came 
pouring out of his mouth and out of his chest. After some time, he 
pulled the stick out of his mouth, recovered, and continued his dance. 
He tried to (;atch the stick again, looking upward and holding his 
hands close to his thighs. As soon as he had caught it all the people 
arose, and when he threw it, they stooped down, hiding in their 
blankets and crying, " wa." The lirst time he threw his stick it did not

bit anyone, but when he threw the second time two young Na'q'oaqtdq 
rushed forward, blood pouring out of their mouths. After some con- 
tortions they lay there dead. The man who had accompanied the 
ma'maq'a's dance with his rattle was acting as though the stick had 
entered his throat and was suftbcatiug him. As soon as the ma'maq'a 
had thrown the second time, he disappeared in the secret room in the 
rear of the house. Soon he reappeared, singing over the dead, who 
were carried into the secret room. Shamans were called, who sang over 
them and cried "hoip," while the ma'maq'a danced a third and a fourth 
time, catching and throwing his stick, without, however, hitting anyone. 
This was the end of the ceremony. 

November 22. — In the morning the Koskimo held a secret meeting, 
at which it was decided that Q'e'q'anqoala was to show the dance 
Ba'baqoayuL (soul catcher). In this dance, which will be found 
described on page 575, the dancer pretends to capture the soul of 
one of the audience; but a certain amount of property is made to 
symbolize the soul. When therefore a dancer catches a soul, it means 
that he takes away from the owner a certain amount of property, which 
is to be distributed among the guests. Therefore the speaker asked at 
this meeting: "Q'e'q'anqoala is going to show his dance. I want to 
know if anyone wants him to catch his soul." Whoever intended to dis- 
tribute blankets offered his soul, saying: " Q'e'q'anqoala, catch my soul, 
for I want to give away blankets to our rivals." The speaker thanked 
them for their^offer. The soul is represented in the dance by a small 
ball of eagle down, which is attached to a string. A.s many balls are 
attached to the string at equal distances as there are men who offered 
their souls to be captured. 

In the afternoon the Kwakiutl held a meeting at the assembly place 
in the woods, in which they laid out the plan for the kuG'xalak ", which 
was to take place on the same evening. The Koskimo intended to have 
a festival on the same day, but finally gave it up on account of the one 
to be held by the Kwakiutl. The people assembled in the evening. 
The Kwakiutl sat in the rear of the house — the Koskimo on the right 
hand side on entering, the Nfi/q'oaqtoq on the left hand side on enter- 
ing. The last to enter were the members of the seal society, who 
took their seats in the last row in the rear of the house. The singers 
sat in front of them, while the old chiefs occupied the front row. When 
all had assembled, the speaker of the Kwakiutl arose and said: " Wel- 
come, friends, on both sides of the house. We are all in our dancing 
house." And turning to the members of the seal society: "Do not 
go too soon, great friends." Now turning to the Kwakiutl, he said: 
"Now be ready with your batons."' As soon as he had finished his

speech, the two messeugers who stood in the doorway said: "K*ex* 
and his sisters are coming/" Then the door opened, and the members 
of the killer whale society entered, surrounding the dancer, whose name 
was K*ex'. He represents the Mink, and performs the dance which, 
aecoiding to the legend, Mink danced after having killed the son of 
the wolves. He had a red circular spot surrounded by a black ring 
painted on each cheek. He danced holding his palms downward and 
raising them alternately to his eyes, as though he was hiding his face 
behind his blanket. Another man, whose name was also K-ex-, who 
was sitting in the rear of the house, began dancing when the singers 
commenced K-ex-'s song:

That is, '' Mink put on his head tlie middle of the face of NoLq'dlsElas." 

With the word "Qapama'ld" of the song the dancer i)ut liis palms 
vertically to his nose, indicating the long nose of the fool dancers. 
They inserted in the song first the name of the fool dancer NoLq'dlsElas, 
who, as soon as his name was mentioned, tried to strike the dancer and 
to stop his song. After his name they inserted those of No'L'it and of 
Wil'xsqEmlis. 

Then (^E'lqex-rda, speaker of the G*e'xsEm, arose and said: "This is 
done in rivalry with what the Na'q'oaqtoq did last night. They showed 
us their legends; these are our legends. I do not need to tell them to 
you; you all know how K-ex-, the Mink, killed the sou of the wolves." 

Now the door opened, and four men dressed as policemen entered. 
They were KuLE'm, MEsx-a'q, xE'lpatdsEla, and G-d'koya. 

The last of these acted the judge and carried a book. He sent the 



iG*a'xLig*a K-ex-ik- Lo'gwas wis'waqoak*

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 563 

policemen around asking if everybody was present, and KuLE'm asked, 
"Are all here ? " The people replied, " Yes." Then the two other police- 
men went around, looked at everybody, and stated that one person was 
missing. They went out, and soon returned leading the old woman 
Gudo'yo, whose hands were fastened with handcuffs. Then they pre- 
tended to hold court over her on account of her absence. Tl»e Judge 
])retended to read the law on the case, and fined her $70. She replied 
that she was poor; that she was able to pay in blankets, but had no 
ready money. KuLE'm, who acted the interpreter, pretended to trans- 
late what she said into English, and the payment of 70 blankets was 
accepted. Then the friends of Gudd'yd turned against the judge and 
said: "That is always your way, policemen. As soon as you see any- 
one who has money, you arrest him and fine him." She was unchained, 
and the policemen went back to the door.^ 

They called K-ex* and his friends, the killer whales, and told them 
to fetch the 70 blankets. The cousin of the old woman, who was the 
speaker of the Maa'mtag-ila, told them where to go, and soon they 
returned. Gudo'yo's sister, Le'mElxa'lag-ilis, followed them, dancing. 
All the people were singing a ha'mshamtsEs song for her. The blan- 
kets were distributed in her name. The ma'maq'a of the l^a'q'oaqtoq 
received his share first; then the other members of his tribe, and after- 
wards the Koskimo, beginning with the ha'mats'a. While this was 
going on, button blankets and bracelets tied to sticks were being carried 
into the house. A G-e'xsEm, whose daughter had married Le'Lelalak", 
a G'i'g'ilqam of the Kue'xa, was going to repay the purchase money of 
his daughter. This ceremony is called "the brief (jaute'x'a." The 
speaker of the (x'o'xsEm, QE'lqex-ala, arose and shouted: "Get ready, 
Le/Leliilak","^ and called all the chiefs of the clan G-i'g'ilqam. Le'Le- 
liilak" was sitting at the left hand side of the door. He arose and said: 
"Did I hear you call my name?" " Yes," replied the speaker, "your 
father in-law is going to repay you." "I wish it were true what you 
said," ' remarked Le'Lelalak". 

Then the si)eaker counted 39 button blankets and gave them to him, 
saying that the fortieth was not quite finished yet; and he added: 
"Here are 120 blankets; if your button blankets should not be enough 
for all the guests, you may use these." After he had spoken, K-a/qoLe, 
a speaker of the G-i'g-ilqam, arose, holding the speaker's stafl' in his 
hands, and said : "I will go and take the blankets." With quick steps 
he ran around the fire, turning in the rear and in the front of the house. 
That meant that he was treading on all the tribes, because the Kwakiutl 
rank highest of all. Then he struck the pile of blankets with his

staff. That meaut lie broke the canoe in which the bhiukets were 
stored so that they fell into the sea, the sea meauiug the other tribes. 
Now he turned angrily to the Na/q'oaqtoq, and said : " I am Lc'Lclalak", 
who promised to give blankets to the Na'q'oaqtoq."' After he had fin- 
ished, QE'lqex'ala spoke again and gave Le/Leljilak" the name which 
was promised to him at the time of his marriage by his fatlier-in-law. 
fie said: "Your name shall be G'a'lqEmalis:'^ your name shall be 
QEuio'ta'yalis^ (howling over all the tribes), and your name shall be 
L'eraElxElag-ilis^ and SEbE'lxalag-ilis." 

Then NE'msqEmut, an old chief of the G-I'g-ilqam, spoke: "N^ow 
you will be Walas'axa'ak"."* Immediately x-rx*eqala, chief of the 
G-i'g-ilqam, interrupted him: "I am the only one who has the 
Walas'axa'ak". Do you want to know where I obtained it? Walas 
NEmogwis and O'maxtTi'laLe lived in K''a'qa. There he first came 
down from heaven, there he had his dancing house, and since that time 
it is called ' K*a'qa,' or built on a rock. Come ! Wa'xsqEmis, that we 
may express our joy." Wa'xsqEmis is a fool dancer, and as soon as he 
was called he became excited, and ran around the fire in the fashion of 
the fool dancers, crying "hi, hi, hi." Then the people sang his song. 
Now x-i'x-eqala continued, turning to the other tribes: "I will tell you 
how strong my clan is: Here is the copper Ma'xts'olEmtscwuL lying 
dead in the water off our beach. Here is the copper Ya'xyaxaqau'- 
loma lying dead in the water off our beach. Here is the copper 
Ya'xyaxaqau'loma lying dead in the water off our beach. Here is the 
copper (^oayi'mk-in lying dead in the water off our beach. Here 
is the copper Qa'wi'g-a lying dead in the water oft' our beach. Here 
is the copper NE'nqamala lying dead in the water off" our beach." ^ 

When the name of the copper Qa'wi'g-a (meaning raven) was called, 

^Nine years ago LC'Loliilak" had promised blankets to the Na'q'oaqtoq; hut as he 
had uot fultilled his promise so far, he was much ridiculed. Whenever a festival was 
held, they said they heard him crying in the woods because he was not able to 
gather a sufficient number of blankets.

The expression, "lying dead in the water oft' our beach," means that the clan had 
broken it. 

The lirst of these coppers is valued at 4,000 blankets, the next at 3,500 blankets. 
It is counted twice, because it was broken twice by the clan. The Qoayt'mk'in cop- 
j)er is valued at 1,500 blankets. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 565 

everybody expected that the ha'mats'a would get excited, and looked 
at him anxiously, but everything remained quiet. X*I'x*eqala continued: 
"That is the strength of my clan. !!fone among all the other Kwakiutl 
clans ever broke as many expensive coppers as we did." With every 
copper that he named he put his staff down violently, bending his knees 
at the same time. Then he turned to the G'O/xsEm and said: "I thank 
you for the button blankets and for the 2,000 bracelets," and promised 
at once to distribute the blankets among the Na/q'oaqtoq. 

After he had spoken, Le/Leliilak" asked his brother-in-law, "What 
became of the 40 blankets which I gave you at the time of my mar- 
riage to your sister? If you do not want to pay them, say so; but if 
you do intend to pay them, let me know. Do as you have a mind to; 
I do not care." Then his brother-in-law replied that he was going to pay 
in course of time. Le'Lelalak" then promised to give the 40 blankets 
to the Koskimo. 

Now Ho'LElite arose and said : "You have finished. Now let us take 
up the object of our convention." The blankets were put aside. As 
was stated before, the festival was to be a kue'xalak" — that means the 
initiation into one of the lower ranks of the secret societies. The per- 
son to be initiated was the son of Se'g-ag'ila, who had arranged this 
feast. He gave his membershij) in the fool dancer society to his young- 
son. The people began to sing a fool dancer's song. Then suddenly 
a fool dancer rushed out of the right hand rear corner of the house 
carrying his young son in his arms and crying, " wie', wie/." At the 
same time he cleaned his nose and put the mucus on the boy's face. 
This is done because it is supposed that the power of the fool dancer 
is seated in the mucus. After he had run around the fire once he dis- 
appeared again behind the curtain which was drawn in the rear of the 
house. Ho'LElite arose again and said: "This is NuLt'aqa/lag-ilis," 
thus naming tlie place which the boy was to occupy. The people sang 
again, and a woman wearing the headdress of the Nri'naqaualiL came 
out. Another woman danced backward in front of her. A man carry- 
ing a rattle accompanied her. This dance was not an initiation, but 
only a representation of the dance which X-I'x*eqala had obtained from 
his wife by marriage. After this dance was finished, a young boy was 
to perform another Na'naqaualiL dance. He came out and danced once 
around the fire, accompanied by one man carrying a rattle and three 
others who watched him. He wore a head ornament witli four horns. 
After this dance he disappeared l»ehind the curtain, and when the 
second song commenced, a large mask representing the sunrise Na'x- 
naik-emL appeared in the rear of the house, coming from behind the 
curtain. It was a double mask, wliich in the course of the dance was 
to open. When the wearer of the mask opened it, one side of the 
cover broke. Although the attendants rushed up to the mask imme 
diately, trying to cover it, the ha'mats'a had seen what had happened 



5G6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

and became excited at once, crying "bap, bap, bap." Tbe fool dan- 
cers and tbe bears joined him. Tbe ba'mats'a rusbed down into the 
middle of tbe bouse, tbe fool dancers struck and stabbed tbe people 
and pelted tbem witb stones, and tbe bears scratclied tbem. Tbe great- 
est excitement prevailed. After a very sbort time the members of the 
secret societies of tlie other tribes became excited too. Tbe ha'mats'a 
of tbe Koskimo jumped up trembling and crying "bap, bap." Tbe 
Na'q'oaqtoq ha/mats'a followed, and so did tbe pa'xala, who jumped 
about tbe fire squatting and crying " mamamamamama," which is tbe cry 
of tbe ghosts. He took burning coals and firebrands and threw tbem 
among the people. Tlie women ran screaming into tbe bedrooms. 
The Koskimo accompanied their ha/mats'a out of tbe bouse, and the 
Na'q'oaqtoq were driven out by their ha'mats'a. While this was going 
OD, some of the Kwakiutl were trying to rearrange the fire. According 
to the rules, the members of the seal society ought to have broken the 
right-hand side of the house first, the left band side next, and ought 
to have driven out tbe people in this manner, the ha'mats'a biting 
the people, the fool dancers striking, and the bear dancers scratching 
them. But it seems that there was some misunderstanding in this 
case, and the bouse was not broken, although tbe excitement which 
l)revailed was very great. While the Kwakiutl were trying to rear- 
range the fire, T'et'esumx-tsana, uncle of the Na'q'oaqtoq pa'xala, ran 
around tbe fire shouting "naualakwai'!"' drawing tbe word out as long 
as bis breath would allow. As tbe people left the house, the noise 
subsided, although the members of tbe seal society continued to rave 
in tbe house. 

After a while the Koskimo returned into tbe dancing bouse, four 
men going first, each carrying a staff" held in a horizontal position, and 
each singing bis own song. 

They were Wina'Iag'iiis. They led a young girl, who wore a bead 
ring. She was just initiated into a secret society.^ Then two of tbe 
speakers spoke at tbe same time. So far as it was possible to make 
out what they said,. they spoke about as follows: "This girl has been 
tbe game of Wina'lag-ilis, who is hunting novices." They led her 
around the fire once and guided her behind tbe curtain. While she 
was going around the fire, tbe Na'q'oaqtoq pa'xala pointed his staff" 
at tbe Koskimo. This, it is said, meant that he would kill tbem if 
they did not bring a novice. 

Now tbe Na'q'oaqtoq entered, first a ha'mats'a and two t'o'X'uit, 
who lield each other by the hand. When they came, tbe pa'xala, who 
was all the time standing witb bent knees, dropped down still lower. 
Next, two ma'maq'as entered carrying a dead child in their arms. 
T'o'pewa, speaker of tbe Na'q'oaqtoq said: "Na'q'oaqtoq and Kos- 



' Spirit of the winter dauce. 

^Peoplewho are iuitiated for the first time are called wa'tanEm. After they have 
been wa'tanEm four times they become members of the higher societies, the la'xsS..

kimo, you have a hard task; you must kick against a high moun- 
tain.^ Wina'hig-ilis or Hai'aLihxqas has killed this boy, the son of 
XExua'nElq'ala, the pa'xala. The supernatural i>ower came and took 
him away. He is dead. We will try to resuscitate him." 

As soon as he said so, the ma/maq'a tried to throw the body into 
the fire.^ T'e't'esumx-tsaiia and T'o'pewa pushed them back and 
asked for assistance. Now they put the body down on top of a box 
and T'o'pewa asked the highest pa'xala of the tribe to try to resusci- 
tate the boy. Lo'Xoaxstaak" came and sang his secret soug. Then 
he spoke to the Kwakiutl: "Friends, if you have a mask for the 
winter ceremonial which you want to show, do not let a stranger use 
it; teach your own people to show it, that no mistake may occur. 
Only because a stranger showed your mask a mistake happened and 
brought about our great difficulty. I say so, T'o'pewa."^ Then he went 
around the tire singing. After he had made one circuit, the women 
joined his song and a deep sounding whistle was heard, which repre- 
sents the breath of the pa'xala. He sang four songs, and after every 
song the whistles A^ere heard. Every time it sounded the Kwakiutl 
beat time and cried "hii, ha, hii, hJi." Then the boy began to move 
again and pretended to come to life. This was the end of the festival. 

When all was over, the ha'mats'a of the Koskimo appeared once 
more and ran around the fire, followed by his assistants. Then he dis- 
appeared again. 

November :23. — Early in the morning the Koskimo dressed themselves 
to meet their novice. Two messengers went through the village and 
asked the people to clear the floors of the houses and to sweep them- 
They arranged themselves in two groups — first the wi'xsA, then the 
la'xsa. One of the former carried a skin drum. The men walked 
first. They were followed by the women, among whom was the new 
wa'tanEm, who was initiated the i)receding night. The men were 
singing while the women were dancing. The wa'tanEm danced, raising 
her hands alternately, her elbows close to her sides, the i)alms of the 
han<ls upward. She had four feathers on her head ring. She did not 
dance with the first soug, but joined the dance during the second, third, 
and fourth songs. The la'xsa followed the wi'xsa, at a short distance. 
The men were singing, a woman beat a skin drum, and others, among 
them another wa'tauEni, were dancing. Thus they walked from one 
house to the other. A few hours after this the ha'mats'a was heard all of a 



'Meauing that tliey had to strive against the Kwakiutl. 

^As all of this was quite unprepared, the ceremony was not carried out as it is in 
other cases. If the performance has been planned beforehand, the mfi'maq'as would 
have provided themselves with a skeleton, which they would have carried iu their 
arms in.stead of the child. They would have thrown the bones into the fire, and 
after the charred remains had been seen by the people they would have made them 
disappear in a ditch made for the occ;;sion, and the boy would have risen at the 
place where the charred bones had been seen before. 

'He spoke iu behalf of the latter and therefore used his name.

suddeu on tbe beach west of the vilkige, but soon lie disappeared again. 
Then the Koskimo walked behind the village, where the "breathing 
hole" of the ha'mats'a is supposed to be. During this time he is believed 
to be in the underworld. They went behind the village, thinking that 
he might come up from underground. About 11a. m., a man who had 
gone into the woods west of the village to gather alder bark, was 
attacked by the ha'mats'a of the Koskimo. In order to save himself 
from the attack, he ran into the sea and walked home in the salt water, 
pursued by the ha/mats'a. His cries soon attracted the attention of 
the people. They ran up to the ha'mats'a and surrounded him. He 
was naked, except that he wore a head and neck ring of hemlock 
branches and a belt and apron of the same material. 

After he had been caught, the Koskimo 'sat down, and the song maker 
taught them his new songs. After they had learned the songs, they 
arose. The men took a long plank and beat time on it, while one was 
carrying the skin drum. They sang the first two of the new songs. 
The women went ahead, dancing in honor of the ha'mats'a, who was 
dancing in a squatting position. Thus they approached the village 
slowly, going along the beach. 

Finally they entered the dancing house, where the ha'mats'a danced, 
accompanied by the first and second songs. Then he disappeared in 
his bedroom with his attendants. 

Now Lo'Xoaxstaak" arose and said : " Now, friends, I will ask you 
to help me and dance to-night with the new ha'mats'a which was given 
to you, Toqoamalis, chief of the Koskimo, by the giver of the winter 
ceremonial. I follow his law. All the ha'mats'as shall dance with our 
new ha'mats'a, I do not know yet what his name is going to be. I ask 
you, Ts'a'qoalag-ilis; and you, Ta'nisk'aso; and you, Qoa'ts'amya; and 
you, LemElxa'lag'ilis; and you,Na'noqois; and you,WeqoamiLa'lag'ilis. 
Now you all must go and wash in the water of BaxbakualanuXsi'wae 
and put on the dress of the BaxbakufdanuXsi'wae. That is all." 

Then To'qoamalis arose and said: " O my children. I am glad to see 
that you are obeying the laws that were given to our ancestors. You 
know that if we make a mistake in this ceremonial, it means that our 
lives will be cut short. When I was a young man, I have seen my 
grandfather kill a man who broke the rules of the red cedar bark. 
Thus I tell you A'Labala, and you Lo'Xoaxstaak". That is all." 

Most of the i)eople now left the dancing house. All day whistles 
were heard proceeding from the room of the ha'mats'a. The people 
prepared for the dance that was to be celebrated that night. 

The members of the seal society of the Kwakiutl had remained 
in their dancing house since the preceding night. They were not 
allowed to leave it until the approaching k-ik-i'lnala. The fool 
dancers and bears however, were sent out every now and then to 
get food. At other times they ran out of the house with their lances 
and struck and scratched the i)eople or threw stones at them. Some- 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 569 

times the ha'mats'a, accompanied by some of the fool dancers and bears, 
would leave the house and attack the people. In the afternoon all the 
members of the seal society appeared on the roof of the house. 
Every society howled its peculiar cries, the fool dancers throwing stones 
at the people. During all this time the people were forbidden to pass 
in front of the house. Whenever anyone approached the house, the 
members of the seal society frightened him away. While they were on 
the roof of the house, all standing at the front edge of the roof, a man 
approached. Immediately the ha'mats'a and bears jumped down and 
pursued him. The fool dancers climbed down the sides of the house, 
and all went in hot pursuit until the man escaped into one of the neigh- 
boring houses. Whistles of the different societies were heard in the 
house all day long. 

About half past six in the evening, Lagula'g*aliL and Lo'Xuals black- 
ened their faces, put on blankets and belts, head rings and neck rings 
of red cedar bark, and strewed eagle down on their heads. Then 
they left the dancing house and opened the door of the neighboring 
house. There they stood, and Lagula'g-aliL cried: "Now, que'qutsa 
men and women, let us go into the house;" and Lo'Xuals added: " We 
will pacify our cannibal." Thus they went from house to house. When 
they had returned from the round, four young men went and called the 
people, saying: "Now we come to make you rise." While they were 
still going around, some of the Koskimo gathered in the dancing house, 
beat the boards, and cried "yu" twice, giving a short final rap with each 
cry. As soon as the Kwakiutl heard the beating, they all went to the 
dancing house. There the beating and the cries were repeated twice. 

About 8 p. m. all had assembled in the dancing house. The men of 
the Koskimo tribe were sitting in the rear portion of the house. Then 
LoXuaxstaak", a Koskimo, arose and spoke: "Come, friends, that you 
may see the manner in which I perform the winter ceremonial. This 
was given to us by«the creator of our ancestors. Your ways, Kwakiutl, 
differ greatly from ours. They were given to you in the beginning of 
the world. Take care and do not change your old customs, Kwakiutl ! " 
Then he turned to his tribe and asked them to hold their batons in 
readiness. While he was speaking he held his staff' in a horizontal 
position. Then Ho'LElite, chief speaker of the Kwakiutl, replied: 
"Your speech is good, friend. It is true what you said. I am glad to 
see that you are adhering to the customs that were given to you;" and, 
turning to the Kwakiutl, he continued, "We must answer our friends." 

Now the rest of the que'qutsa of the Koskimo entered — first G*a'loiL, 
the chief speaker of the dancers. He held a speaker's staff in his 
hands and carried a number of blankets over his shoulder. He was 
singing his secret song while the others were singing outside the house. 
He sang as follows: 

1. I tried to tame them by the power of my magic, Crienda. 

2. I blew water uiion them to tametthem, friends. 



570 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

A second speaker followed, carrying his staff. His name is Ma'a. 
He is the highest in rank of all the que'qutsa. When he entered, 
G'a'loiL stopped singing and Ma/a commenced his secret song. At the 
same time G'a'loiL addressed the people and said: "Now look at me 
and at my friend. Look at us, friends, at the other side of the house" 
(meaning the Kwakiutl). And, turning to his own tribe, he continued: 
"Now take care, friends!" To which A'Labala, another speaker, who 
stood next to LoXuaxstaak", replied: "Yes, friends, let us keep in 
readiness. If we should make a mistake, we shall not escape the power 
that will kill us." During these speeches Mfi/a sung his secret song, as 
follows : 

1. Ah, I have everything ; I have all the dances of my enemy. 

2. Ah, I have all the death bringers of my enemy. 

Now a third man, a wolf dancer, entered. Two white feathers were 
attached to his head ring of red cedar bark and his head was strewn 
with white eagle down. His name was NaqwaLaye. As soon as he 
entered, To'qoamalis and Lagulag-aliL, the chiefs of the Koskimo, who 
had been sitting in the rear of the house, arose, and with them their 
speaker, Qoa'lx-ala. 

NaqwaLaye's head ring belongs to the descendants of Ya'xstaL of 
the Naqo'mg-i lisala. According to tradition, the Xoyfi'lEs (see also 
p. 332) had killed all the G'ig*e/LEm, except Leo'lExmut and his three 
sons, the eldest of whom was Ya'xstaL. In order to make his sons 
strong, Leo'lExmut dragged them over the beach around the island of 
G-ig-e'LEm, so that the sharp shells cut their backs. Only Ya'xstaL 
survived this ordeal, and came to be of supernatural strength. Then 
they went to make war upon the Xoya'lEs. When they had reached 
Ta'tsolis, a wolf came to their cami) while they were asleep, threw 
Ya'xstaL on his back, and carried him away. From time to time he 
put him down, in order to see if he was still alive. When he felt his 
breath, he took him up again and continued his course. Finally he 
reached the village of the wolves. He threw Y^a'xstaL down in front 
of the chief's house and, having assumed human shape, he whistled. 
Then many people came out of the houses to see who had come. They 
mistook Ya'xstaL for a sea otter, carried him into the house, threw him 
down, and began to cut him up. When they had cut down his chest 
and were about to open his belly, he jumjied up and asked: "Will you 
help me to take revenge upon the Xoya'lEsr' Th(' wolves promised 
to help him, and asked him: "What did you come for? Do you want 
to have this wedge? It will help you to build canoes in which you can 
reach your enemies." Ya'xstaL did not reply, but merely thought he 
did not want to have the wedge. WTLaqa'latit, chief of the wolves, 
knew his thoughts at once. He asked: "Do you want the harpoon? 
It will enable you to kill seals enough at a time to fill your canoe." 
Ya'xstaL thought that he did not want to have the harpoon, and WlLa- 
qa'latit knew his thoughts. Then the wolves offered him the water of 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 671 

life and the death bringer. He thought: "That is what I came for." 
WiLaqa'latit kuew his thoughts and gave them to him. Then he 
ordered the wolves to devour Ya'xstaL. At once they tore him to 
pieces and devoured him. They vomited the liesh, and when WiLaqa'- 
latit sprinkled it with the water of life, Ya'xstaL arose hale and well. 
He had become exceedingly strong. Then they carried him home. He 
was standing on the back of the largest of the wolves. 

After he had come back, he and his father continued their journey. 
While they were traveling, Ya'xstaL tried his death bringer. He moved 
it in the direction of the woods. At ouce they began to burn. Now 
they met the Xdyn'les, who were coming up to them, many canoes full. 
Lco'lExmut said to Ya'xstaL: "I^ow use your death bringer, but do 
not kill them outright; burn them." Then Ya'xstaL pointed the death 
bringer at the Xoya'lEs while his father was singing. They were 
stricken with terror and jumped into the water, their canoes caught 
fire, and they were all transformed into stones. 

The two feathers on the head ring of the dancer represented the 
death bringer of Ya'xstaL. 

Xext two couples entered, each couple hand in hand. The first couple 
were r)a'La (a man) and Po'wig'ilis (a woman); the second couple were 
G'a'sa (a man) and G-d'qoade (a woman). G-a'sa was carrying a cop- 
per. The faces of these four persons were painted red.' 

When they had reached the rear of the house, G-a'sa spoke as follows : 
" Oh, friends ! turn your faces this way. Look at me ! Treat me and 
my cedar bark ornaments in the right manner. In former times I and 
my people have suffered at your hands, Kwakiutl. We used to flgbt 
with bows and arrows, with spears and guns. We robbed each other's 
blood. But now we fight with this here" (pointing at the copper which 
he was holding in his hands), " and if we have no coppers, we fight 
with canoes or blankets. That is all." 

To this the speaker Qoa'lx-ala replied: ''True is your word, friend 
G-ri'sa. When I was young, I have seen streams of blood shed in war. 
But since that time the white man came and stopped up that stream 
of blood with wealth. Now we are fighting with our wealth. That is 
all." Then he said, turning to his tribe, ''Now, my singers, take your 
batons and be ready to sing." 

Then they all began to beat time and cried "he." They continued 
with a song, for two women, Me'xas and Tsa'uLala, came in dancing : 

All, magician, ah, ah, ah, magician, magician, magician. (Repeated ad infinitum.) 

When the dance ended, G-a'sa spoke again : "You have seen our two 
friends dancing on account of this copper. Its name is 'Killer Whale.' 
It is the property of my tribe, of the Koskimo. Now I will sell it to 

' Up to this year the Koskimo, Na'q'oaqt6q, and La'Lasiqoala never used red paint 
during the winter ceremonial. The (pif-'qutsa of the Kwakiutl haveheen using red 
paint, and this ha.s been imitated by the other tribes. 



572 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

you, Kwakiutl. I promise to give its value to you (lue'tEla, aud to you 
Q'o'moyue, aud to you Walas Kwakiutl, aud to you Q'o'mk-utis. 
This is ' Killer Whale.' I want to sell it at ouce.'' Thus speaking, he 
gave it to Q'eq'anqoala and said: "Go on! Place this copper before 
our friends." He did so. Then a Kwakiutl chief, No'Lq'auLEla, arose 
and spoke to Q'e'q'anqoala : "Briug the copper to me." He did so, 
and No'Lq'auLEla continued: "Oh, my tribe! my friends! Look at me. 
I, No'Lq'auLEla, took the copper for the sake of your name, Kwakiutl, 
because your name is above those of all other tribes aud I do not want 
to see it derided. Now, brother-in-law Nu'xnemis, look at me. I have 
nothing with which to pay for this copper to which I have taken a 
liking. Therefore I ask you and my wife La'msitaso to buy the copper 
for me. That is all, friends ! " 

To this si)eech Ma/a, the Koskimo, replied: "There is no chief like 
you, No'Lq'auLEla. You are the flrst one to treat us well. You carry 
your tribe on your back by the strength of your wealth." 

When he had finished, To'qoamalis, chief of the Koskimo, took a pair 
of blankets and s^joke: "True is your word, Mil'a! No'Lq'auLEla is 
our chief, for he gave us more property than any other chief of the 
Kwakiutl. Go on, No'Lq'auLEla ! buy our copper," and, turning to his 
tribe, he concluded: "Thus I speak for our chief, Koskimo." Now he 
held up the pair of blankets and said: "Look at this, friend! This is 
our good will to our friends on the other side" (meaning the Kwakiutl). 
"I want you to do as our friend G-o'qoade did who brought the copper 
into our dancing house. Sell it for blankets and give them away ! This 
pair of blankets served to keep our copper w^arm. I took it oft' in 
order to put it onto some of our friends on the other side. This is for 
Ya/qois, Se'ix, and Ho'LElite. It is given by G-o'qoade, the daughter 
of Ko'kwiLala. That is all." 

Then Ma'a and G-a'loiL went out, and immediately the que'qutsa 
began to beat time and cried " yfi ! " all at the same time. When they had 
done so, the whistles of the ha'mats'a were heard on the roof of the 
house. Then Ma/a returned, carrying a staff to which an imitation of 
a scalp was attached. He was followed by G-a'loiL. Both remained 
standing at the door, one on each side, and Ma/a said: "Friends, did 
you hear that noise I If I am not mistaken, something dangerous is 
near us. Keep your batons in readiness." 

While he was speaking the door oi)ened and the ha'mats'a Ya'xya* 
k*alag'ilis appeared, crying " hap, hap, hap." His face was blackened. 
He wore a head ring and a neck ring of red cedar bark. His neck 
ring was thin and set at two places with long fringes, indicating that 
this was the first initiation of the new ha'mats'a. He wore no blanket. 
He was accompanied by two attendants, who carried rattles. One of 
them wore a large head ring of red and white cedar bark, the ring of 
the ma'maq'a of the helig-iliqala of the La'Lasiqoala tribe. ^

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 573 

As soon as he entered the Koskimo began to sing: 

1. Your dance does not equal mine, for I am the giver of magic, hame. 

2. I have been in the secret room of BaxbakualannXsi'waf', the giver of magic, hame. 

3. In high ecstasy was BaxhatiifilanuXsi'-wae, the giver of magic, hame, -svheu I was 

near him and uttered his cannibal cry, BaxbakualanuXsI'wae, the giver of 
magic, hamr-. 

The second song was as follows: 

1. I am known here and all over the world, I the supernatural one. 

2. I am renowned here and all over the world, I the supernatural one. 

3. You are the great one who gives coppers, who gives property, the supernatural 

one. 

While the people were singing, the ha'mats'a danced in the doorway 
in a squatting position, turned around, and danced toward the rear of 
the house. Two women danced for him, one to the right, one to the 
left of the door. When he had reached the left hand rear corner of 
the house, Ma'a and G-a'lolL stepped forward and followed him, saying 
now and then: "Great is your magical power. Do not be too violent 
in your fury," and the attendants cried " hoip, hoip." Whenever the 
singers came to the end of a line, the ha'mats'a stopped danciug and 
cried "hap." The attendants gathered around him while the sound of 
wliistles was heard. 

After these two songs had been sung, Ma'a spoke : " Friends, we can 
not pacify the great ha'mats'a with these two songs and by means of 
the dance of these two women. Now arise, women, and dance with 
him. If we should not succeed in pacifying him, we should always be 
troubled by him. We should not be able to eat in our houses on account 
of him. Therefore, friends, sing again." While he was speaking, the 
sound of the whistles continued to be heard. The ha'mats'a was cry- 
ing " hrq)." Then A'Labala stepped up to him and dressed him with a 
black blanket and an apron and strewed eagle down on his hair. 

Now the singers commenced the third song: 

1. You are looking for food, great magician, you are looking for men, ma ha. 

2. You are trying to eat as much as you desire, great magician, you tear off their 

skins, ma ha. 

3. You go close to the secret room, great magician, you have been inside the secret 

room, ma. ha. 

During this song the ha'mats'a was danciug in a standing position. 
His movements were becoming less violent and the sounds of the 
whistles were becoming fainter. The cries " hoip " of his attendants, the 
singing of the men, and the dances of all the women were beginning 
to pacify him. At the end of the song the women took a rest. They 
had been dancing, their backs turned toward the fire, with the excep- 
tion of two who were standing at the sides of the door and who stood 
turned toward the fire. 

Now the speaker G-fi'sa joined Ma'a and G-a/lolL, who were standing 
near the door. Then the singers began the fourth song: 

1. The chief cannibal of the whole world cried hap ; me, hama. 

2. Now eat, chief cannibal of the whole world, me hama. 

3. Do not try to hide from me, me hama. 



574 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The ha/mats'a was dancing still more quietly, first to the right and 
then to the left in the rear of the house, then around the fire. In front 
of the fire he squatted down, crying "hap." His attendants gathered 
around him and shook their rattles, crying "hoip." Then, with the 
beginning of the next line of the song, he continued his dance, and 
after four circuits he disappeared behind the curtain which was 
stretched in the left-hand rear corner of the house. 

Then Ma'a, who was still standing near the door with his two com- 
panions, spoke: "Friends on the other side of the house! Now our 
great friend is pacified." While he was speaking, Ko'kwiLala, the 
helper in the winter dance, swept the floor with hemlock twigs, in 
order to prepare it for the following dances. 

Then A'Labala, who was standing in the right-hand rear corner of 
the house, spoke : " Take care, friends on the other side of the house. 
Watch my customs, for they were given to my tribe, the Koskimo, and 
to the L'a'sq'enox and G'o'p'enox, and to you Gua'ts'enox, by the 
Maker of the world. Your customs, friends on the other side of the 
house, differ from ours. They were given to you. I am glad to see 
that you as well as we are observing our old laws. Now Tabala, 
Ha'nk-ala, Tsa'xis, and LoXuals, go and fetch our chiefs blankets." 

The four men left the house, and soon they returned carrying the 
blankets. G*a'sa took one pair and said: " Ho'LElite and Nu'xnemis, 
look at these blankets. That is the power of our winter dance. The 
ha'mats'a who just finished dancing is Ya'xyak*a'lag*ilis, and these 
blankets will be given away in honor of his name and of his dance." 
Then he gave the first blanket to Ya'qois, the chief ha'mats'a of the 
Kwakiutl, and then to the other men in order. When all were dis- 
tributed, Ho'LElite spoke : " Friends, did you hear what G*a'sa said ? 
Everything he said is true, except one remark, in which he is mis- 
taken. You said that your customs in regard to dances and festivals 
differ from ours ; remember, we are all of the same name. That is all. 
Thank you for this red cedar bark that you gave us (meaning the 
blanket). Now 1 have finished." 

Then Qoa'qoaxst'ala walked around the fire, apparently without any 
purpose, but in fact as a signal for the dancers, who were standing out 
side the house, to enter. The door flung open, Ma'a, G-a'loiL and 
G-a'sa, who remained standing near the door, gave a signal to the 
singers, who began to beat time very rapidly. A song was heard out- 
side the house, and now a dancer, K'ue'daqala by name, entered with 
quick, short steps, his hands stretched backward under his blanket, 
his face blackened. He was both ma'maq'a and ha'mshamtsEs. As 
soon as he had come to the rear of the house, the singers ceased beat- 
ing the boards. Ma'a said : " Thank you, friend, for coming to this 
dance." 

Then G'a'loiL gave another signal, and a female dancer, T'e'La by 
name, entered, her hands stretched forward. Again the singers stopped 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 575 

beating the boards. G-a'loiL gave another signal, and a second 
woman, G-a'lg-amqas by name, entered, and danced in the same man- 
ner. She stepped up to T'e/La, and the singers stopped beating the 
planks. 

Then Gr-a'sa spoke : " Friends, look at these two women. They are 
the mothers of my tribe. They carry all the winter dances. Whenever 
these two appear, we must be on the alert, for they are always followed 
by other dancers."' When he had finished, LoXoaxstaak" told the 
I)eople to be careful, becausehe had heard the voice of Q'e'q'anqoala, the 
Ba/baqoayuL (soul catcher).' 

As soon as he entered, all the dancers stooped down as though they 
were trying to hide, for fear that Ba/baqoayuL might take their souls. 
His aunt, Po'sqaas, took a position to the left of the door, and while he 
was walking around the fire she danced the ha'mshamtsEs dance. 
When he came back to the place in front of the fire, all the people 
arose and he lifted his hands, the palms being held close together. 
This was repeated four times. When he stopped the fourth time in 
front of the fire, he opened his palms and the "soul" was seen between 
them. The speaker told the singers to stop beating the boards, and 
Ma/a went about among the people in order to find whose soul the 
dancer had caught. After a short while he turned to the people and 
said: "My friend Q'c/q'anqoala has captured the soul of our chief 
La'qolag'ilis." Then the latter stepped forward and asked the singers 
to sing the song of Q'e/q'anqoala and of his aunt Po'sqaas. 

They sang as follows : 

1. I go to obtain your cedar bark ornaments, ba, your cedar bark ornaments, bame 

me, bame, bame, bamc be bama be be bamil. 

2. Now your dance will sbine tbrougbout tbe world wberever a winter dance is beld ; 

Giver of ligbt, bame me, bama. 

During this song the Ba'baqoayuL was dancing on one spot in 
the rear of the fire in a bent position. Po'sqaas was dancing the 
ha'mshamtsEs dance to the left of the door, and G*a/sa and G-fi'lolL, 
the greatest ma'maq'a among the Koskimo, danced around the fire, 
their elbows held close to their sides, forearms held forward, hands 
closed, and thumbs stretched upward. 

At the end of the dance La'qolag'ilis spoke to Q'P'q'anqoala: " Come, 
my son ! I thank you for bringing back my soul, for I am saved now." 
Then he called the two chief speakers, A'Labala and Lo'Xoaxstaak". 
They followed his summons, and he gave them a stick about 2 feet 
long. Lo'Xoaxstaak" held it up and said, " Oh, friends on the other 

'Tbis is a t'o'X'uit dance of tbe G"6'p'en6x. Tbe dancer is supposed to be able to 
catch tbe absent souls of people. He dances, bis palms beld close to tbe body, like the 
ma'maq'a. (See p. 560.) A string is fastened to bis middle finger and a small ball of 
eagledown is fastened to tbe middle of the string. When be opens bis bands, the ball 
is seen in the middle between them, tbe ends of tbe string being tied to tbe middle 
fingers. It represents tbe soul that tbe dancer has captured. Tbe details of this 
dance are described in tlie text. (See also p. 561.)

side. I am glad that we have someone who cau catch our souls when 
they fly away from us. Now I will pay you, Kwakiutl. Thus I speak 
for Lfi'qolag'ilis. Here are blankets for you, Gue'tEla. Here are blan- 
kets for you, Q'o'moyue ; blankets for you, Walas Kwakiutl ; blankets 
for you, Q'o'mk-utis. This is a canoe worth 100 blankets, given by 
Q'e'q'anqoala, the sou of La'qolag-ilis. 

To this La'mg-ala, a Walas Kwakiutl, replied: "Thank you for your 
good words, A'Labala. Did you say that you have someone who under- 
stands to catch the souls of men?" "Yes," shouted many of the 
Koskimo. He continued: "Thank you. We might need your help." 
Then, turning to the Kwakmtl: " Friends, I ask you to keep yourselves 
in readiness, for the Koskimo are like to a vast mountain of wealth, from 
which rocks are rolling down all the time. If we do not defend our- 
selves, we shall be buried by their property. Behold, friends ! They 
are dancing and making merry day after day. But we are not doing 
so. Eemember, this is our village and our battlefield. If we do not 
open our eyes and awake, we shall lose our high rank. Eemember, 
Kwakiutl, we have never been vanquished by another tribe. That is 
all." 

Now a loud clapping was heard outside the house. The walls were 
beaten with sticks, and Ma'a gave a signal to the singers to beat the 
boards. The door opened and a man entered, the chief gue'so, fol- 
lowed by four other members of the group.^ They hopped into the 
house holding their feet close together. When they had reached 
the rear of the house, Ma'a, who was holding a gun in place of a 
speaker's staff, spoke: "Friends, why should you not come to join our 
dance f" and, turning to the Kwakiutl, he continued: "Friends on the 
other side, these are our friends the ' Pigs ! ' Formerly they were 
'Sea Lions.' This is to inform you." Next, LoXoaxstaak" said to the 
chief singer, Qoa'qoaxst'ala: "Look out! our friends are very merry 
and they wish to dance." The maa'myaenox^ commenced a soug, which 
was taken up by the singers : 

1. What is on the enemy's blanket! Wiee. 

2. War is on the enemy's blanket. Wiee. 

The women arose and danced, raising their forearms and holding up 
their first fingers. This song and dance were repeated four times. At 
the end of the song the singers beat time very rapidly and then the 
ha'mats'a's cry "hap" was heard in the secret room. 

This song and dance were given by the wolves to Ya'xstaL, and are 
used by his descendants to excite the ha'mats'a and warriors who go 
out to battle. 

When the singers commenced the soug for the third time, G-a'loiL, who 

'This is one of the que'qutsa groups of the Koskimo. Their present name is 
gue'guso (pigs) while formerly they were called L'e'LexEn (sea lions). 

2 Another of the que'qutsa societies of the Koskimo, embracing the daughters of 
the chiefs — those who must not be maltreated. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 577 

represented Ya'xstaL himself, joined the daiiec of tlie women. He 
jumped about in a circle in the wildest fashion. Then the ha/mats'a's 
cries " hap/' and the ([uieting calls of his attendants, " hoii),'' were 
heard. 

After the song and dance had been repeated a fourth time, Xule'qulEls, 
a G-d'p'enox, and his speaker, Hc/g-ilaxse'k-a, arose. The latter took 
up some blankets and spoke: "Yes, friends on the other side! 
Kwakiutl! I have my ways of celebrating the winter ceremonial, and 
3 on have your own, different from mine. Thus it was given to you by 
the Giver of Dances. I should like to have your dances, but I am 
afraid to change my ways, for they were given to me in the beginning 
of the world. This song which we just sang was given by the wolves 
to Ya'xstaL at x)a'yaiL when he received the death bringer with which 
lie was to burn his enemies or to transform them into stone or ashes. 
We are of Ya'xstaL's blood. But instead of fighting our enemies with 
his death bringer, we fight with these blankets and other kinds of prop- 
erty." Then he distributed the blankets among the Kwakiutl. 

Next, two young men whose faces were blackened stepped forward, 
and one of them said : " I am going to look for my friend." He went out 
and brought an old woman to the middle of the house, where she sat 
down. QoiVqoaxst'alasaid: ''Take care, friends! this woman is going 
to dance. Prepare to sing her song," Then the singers beat the boards 
rapidly and cried "yfi." The beating and the cry were repeated at a 
given signal. As soon as the second cry died away, another ha'mats'a 
was heard outside the house, 

A'Labala, who had left the house a short while ago, reentered, stood 
in the doorway, and spoke: "Look at me, friends! Now take care! I 
have seen something outside the house that looks as though it was not 
going to have mercy upon anybody. Thus I tell you. Now beat the 
boards!" Then the singers began to beat time, the door opened, and 
the ha'mats'a entered crying "hap, hfip, hap." At once everybody 
commenced to sing his or her secret song. A'Labala went up to the 
ha'mats'a with short quick stei)S and then back again, saying: "Come 
friend, that this great tribe may see you." Then he turned around 
and said: "This is Ts'a'qoalag'ilis, our chief ha'mats'a. Take care, 
friends; he devours property, not flesh of men." 

Now the ha'mats'a came down to the middle of the house. He wore 
a head ring of red cedar bark, to the back and front of which branches 
of balsam pine about six inches long were attached crosswise. His 
neck ring was worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm. It 
was made of red cedar bark wound with branches of balsam pine. The 
women began to dance for him. He danced, squatting, toward the 
rear of the house, and was joined by the old ha'mats'as, Ta'nisk-asO, 
Qoa'ts'Eniya, LeniElxa'lag-ilis, Na'uoqois, and WeqoamiLa'lag'ilis, who 
entered one by one, crying "hap." Finally they reached the rear of the 
house, where they remained standing in a row, their backs turned

578 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

toward the fire. Tbeu the door opened and the new ha'mats'a, who 
had been brought back in the morning, entered, crying "hap, hap, 
hap." He 'wore a head ring made of balsam pine, to which a long 
plaited trail of the same material was attached. The trail reached 
down to the small of the back. Three white rings about one inch in 
diameter, made of cedar withs, the bark of which had been stripped 
off", were attached to the ring over his forehead and one on each side, 
all on the same level. Another ring of the same material was attached 
to the trail. He wore an apron made of balsam pine; his neck ring, 
arm rings, and anklets were made of the same material. He was held 
by one assistant. 

As soQn as he entered, the singers began to beat the boards, and con- 
tinued until he had come down to the floor. Then they began to sing- 
bis first song: 

1. He cried lifip for me, tlie only great being in our world. 

2. BaxbakualantiXsi'wae cried liiip for me, the great cannibal of onr world. 

3. BaxbakaalaunXsi'war- taught me to devour lives, the gre.it cannibal of our world. 

He danced to this song, and Ts'a'qoalag-ilis, the chief ha'mats'a, 
danced forward to meet him, cried "hap!'' and attacked the people. 

After this song LoXuaxstaak" arose in the rear of the house, holding 
a copper, and a woman named Ayaqa, brought a striji of calico about 
40 yards long, which was unrolled and spread in a circle around the fire. 

Then the singers began the second song: 

1. I give you to eat, I give you to eat, good cannibal. 

2. I pacify you with property, I pacify you with property, good cannibal. 

3. I push down your wildness, I push down your wilduess, good cannibal. 

4. I give you lives to eat, I give you lives to eat, good cannibal. 

The luVmats'as were dancing between the calico and the fire in a 
squatting position. Their attendants tried to pacify them with cries of 
'•hoip," and women danced for them. Then A'Labala stepped forward 
and asked the singers to wait before beginning the third song. He 
called his speaker, Td'qoamalis, who took his position in the rear of the 
house, and addressed the people as follows: 

"Yes, my children, I am the storage box of your thoughts, for I 
remember all the old tales, and in my young days I have seen things 
which you young people never heard of. It is good that there is one 
old man who can show you all these things. Now I will go to this 
hfi'mats'a and take off" the dress that BaxbakualanuXsT'wae put on 
him." He stepped up to the ha'mats'a, who was standing in the rear 
of the house, and took off" his head ring first, then his neck ring. He 
cut off the arm rings and anklets and gave them to LamfiLa. Then he 
asked Nau'a(iala to bring blankets and ornaments made of red cedar 
bark. Nau'aqala went to fetch them from his bedroom, and when he 
had returned, Td'qoamalis proceeded to dress the ha'mats'a. Pie put the 
blue blanket over his back and cedar bark ornaments on his head, 
bis neck, his arms, and around his ankles. He also tied a dancing 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 579 

apron around his waist and strewed eagle down on his liead. Then 
he said, "It is done." 

The young ha'mats'a cried "hap, hap, hap,'' and attacked the people. 

Xow the singers began the third song: 

1. The cedar bark of the winter dauco is all arouud the workl. 

2. The eagle down of the winter daijce is all arouud the world. 

". The songs of the winter dance are most powerful all around the world. 
4. For mo cried hap, BaxbakurilanuXsT'war", the great magician. 

During this song all the ha'mats'as were dancing in standing pos- 
ture and the women were dancing for them. At the end of the song 
they all stood in the rear of the house. 

After a short while the singers beat time again and commenced tbe 
fourth song of the ha'mats'a: 

1. Nobody can imitate your cries, great BaxbakujilanuXsT'wMc, great magician, 

liama mfi. 
Nobody can imitate your uance, great Baxbaku;il;iuuXsi'wac, great magician, 
hamfi mil. 

2. I was taken into the room of BaxbakualanuXsl'wac, the great magician, hama ma. 
I received the red cedar bark of BaxbakualanuXsI'wac, the great magician, 

hama ma. 

3. He put into mo all the dances, BaxbakualauuXsI'wac, the great magician, 

hama mfi. 
3. The cannibal pole is sliaking, the pole of BaxbakuAlanuXsl'war', the great magi- 
cian, hama ma. 

When the song was nearly ended, the ha'mats'as disappeared in their 
secret room, led by Ts'a'qoalag-ilis, 

Then Lo'Xuaxstaak" stepped forward, still holding his copper, and 
spoke: "Now that is the end, friends. You have seen my way. This 
is my way." With this he pointed to his copper. " This is the price 
of a ha'mats'a, I do not mean you, Kwakiutl; I mean my rivals in ray 
own tribe. They all want to have ha'mats'as, but they want to show 
them cheaply without giving away a copper." The Kwakiutl inter- 
rupted him now and then with cries: "That is true! your words are 
true, chief ! " Lo'Xuaxstaak" continued : " Our ha'mats'a touched some 
of yoii, Kwakiutl, in his excitement and hurt you. This copper, the 
face of which is engraved with the design of the grizzly bear, is worth 
500 blankets. It is to pay those whom our great friend has bitten. 
You, La'nisitaso, were bitten this morning. Here are 50 blankets of 
this copper for you; and you, Ho'lElite, 50 blankets of this copper for 
you; and you, G-a'lg-alXola, 50 blankets of this copper for you; and 
you, Xo'Lq'auLEla, 50 blankets of this copper for you; and you, K-ex-,- 
50 blankets of this copper for you; and you, Qa'wiqam, 50 blankets 
of this copper for you; and you, Nu'xnemis, 50 blankets of this cop- 
per for you; and you, Mr''qoadaxstala, 50 blankets of this copper for 
you; and you, K-a'qoLc, 50 blankets of this copper for you; and you, 
La'mg ala, 50 blankets of this copper for you. That is all. Now, 
(ioa'yuqoalag-ilis, I will ask you to come and tell the story of the 



580 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

lul'mats'a, for the tribes say we own neither ha'mats'a nor other dances. 
That is all." 

Then (^oa'yuqoalag-ilis came forward. The Koskimo placed a box 
for him in the rear of the house. lie sat down and began : 

"Be quiet and listen to me, for I ara going to tell you the story 
of this ha'inats'a, which will show you that we, Koskimo, G-o'p'euox, 
L'a'sq'enox, and Gua'ts'enox, do not steal winter dances from you, 
Kwakiutl, nor from other tribes. All the winter dances were given to 
us by the Maker of Man in the beginning of the world, i he ha'mats'a 
whom we have seen to-night comes from llai'alik-awc. All the clans 
Hahai'alik-awe of all the tribes in tlie whole world have a right to a 
ha'mats'a with raven whistle, for Hai'alik-awe had a ha'mats'a with a 
raven whistle at the place which we name Lala't'e, and his ha'mats'a's 
name was Qa'yuL and Qalama'lag-ilis. We may use either of these 
names for our ha'mats'a. AVe will call him now Qa'yuL, and if he 
should be taken away again by BaxbakmllanuXsi'wae, we will call him 
Qalaraa'lag-ilis. You, Kwakiutl, you always use hemlock branches for 
your ha'mats'a, for it was gi;^en to you in this manner by the INfaker 
of Man. It was given to us to use balsam pine for our ha'inats'a and 
for all other dances. The white rings you saw on the head ornaments 
of our ha'mats'a are the same as worn by BaxbakurdanuXsi'wae when 
he was excited. The attendants passed ropes through these rings to 
tie him down, that lie might not leave his house and devour his i)eople; 
and the trail of his ornament served for his attendant to hold him. 
You also saw the streaks of blood running from the corners of his mouth 
to the lobes of the ears. They indicate that BaxbakualanuXsrwae 
lives on nothing but blood. That is all." 

He had hardly finished when Lo'Xoals, a Koskimo, came forward 
from the rear of the house holding a single blanket. He spoke: "Look 
at me. See this single blanket! I am tired of waiting so long at this 
place for one solitary single blanket. Now I will show you that I do 
not care for a single blanket." He tore it, threw it into the iire, and 
continued: "Xow you who saw it in the fire take good care to keep 
it warm. All single blankets will go there hereafter. We are too 
great a tribe to receive only a single blanket each." Then uamaLa 
went up to him and stopped him. He held six button blankets and 
said : 

"Friends on the other side! Each of us has something to say. 
Lo'Xoals has had his way when he wanted to burn this blanket. 
Kwakiutl, he did not mean you. Do not feel offended by it. T have 
rivals in my own tribe and I must Avake them up from their sleep, for 
they do not see tbat it is hard work for us to fight you with property. 
We are the Koskimo, who have never been vanquished by any tribe, 
neither in wars of blood nor in wars of property. Now I will ask you 
one thing: Treat me well. Of olden times the Kwakiutl illtreated my 
forefathers and fought them so that the blood ran over the ground. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 581 

Now we fight with button bhiiikets and other kinds of property, smil- 
ing at each other. Oh, how good is the new time! That is all. Now 
to these button blankets. Son-in-law, come and stand where I can see 
yon." Then Nau'aqala stepped to the front of the house and said: 
"Here I am." LamaLa continued: "I understand that you have no 
button blankets. Therefore, I thought I might bring you some. Here 
are six button blankets. I took them from your wife's back. Now 
come and take them, and do with them as yon please." 

Nau'aqala asked: "What did you say, my father in-law?" Then 
LamaLa repeated: "I told you, son-in-law, that I had taken six button 
blankets from the back of your wife and I give them to you. Now 
come and take them." Nau'aqala spoke : " I will go, for I am not afraid 
to go and take them. I have given away button blankets three times, 
and this will be the fourth time. Now I will go and take them." Then 
he went back to his place and said, turning toward the people: "Oh, 
my tribe! look at these button blankets and see what I am going to do 
with them. One of you shall tell me what to do with them." 

To this the old woman who was stauding near the door replied : "My 
tribe, I want to say a few words to you, and i^articularly to my son, who 
asked to be told Avhat to do with these blankets. Friends, you all 
know my name. You knew my father and you know what he did with 
his property. He was thoughtless and did not care what he did. He 
gave away or killed slaves; he gave away or burnt his canoes in the 
fire of the feast house; he gave away sea-otter skins to his rivals in 
his own tribe or to chiefs of other tribes, or he cut them to pieces. You 
know that it is true what I say. This, my son, is the road your father 
laid out for you and on which you must walk. Your father was no 
common man; he was a true chief among the Koskimo. Do as your 
fiither did. Either tear up these button blankets or give them to our 
rival tribe, the Kwakiutl. That is all." 

Lo'Xoaxstaak" arose when she had finished and asked: "Did you 
hear what our aunt said? I will not block the road my father laid out 
for me. I will not break the law that my chief laid down for me. I 
will give these button blankets to my rivals, the Kwakiutl. The war 
that we are having now is sweet and strong." Then he gave the but- 
ton blankets to the Kwakiutl; first to Ya'qois, then to the old chiefs. 
After they had been distributed, Lo'Xoaxstaak" said: "These button 
blankets are the red cedar bark that I have taken from the head of my 
ha'mats'a. Next the men brought him 40 white blankets, and he said: 
"These white blankets are the red cedar bark that 1 have taken from 
the neck of mj^ ha'mats'a and I am going to give them to you, Kwa- 
kiutl." He distributed them among the next in rank. Then he took 
the calico and said: "This is the red cedar bark that I took from the 
arms and from the legs of my ha/mats'a. I will give it to the women 
and children of the Kwakiutl." They tore it up, and gave the pieces 
to the Kwakiutl — first to Y'a'qois, then to the others. 



582 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

With this the festival ended, and the people went home. It was 
about 1 a. m. when the calico was distributed. 

About 7 p. m., November 23,Ho'LElite sent two messengers, NdLElag-- 
ilis and KuLE'm, to call all the men of the Kwakiutl tribe to a secret 
meeting to be held in his house. The messengers went into all the 
houses and called the Kwakiutl, whispering into their ears. They 
slipped out at once and went to Hcl'LElite's house. Great care was 
taken that the Na'q'oaqtoq and Koskimo should not know what was 
going on. As soon as the men were assembled, Ho'LElite arose and 
spoke: "Indeed, friends, you have gratified my wishes, for you all 
have come as soon as I sent for you. I am glad that you are keeping 
the laws that were handed down to us from the times of our grand- 
fathers. You will have observed that the Koskimo are likely to beat 
us in our war with property. Therefore I ask you not to be asleei^, 
else the Koskimo will surely walk right over us, friends! Wake uj) 
and open your eyes. Do not let the wealth of our rivals blind you. 
Our ancestors have never been vanquished. I do not want to see the 
Koskimo vanquish us now. I have called you in order to inform you 
that my chief Se'g-ag'ila is going to give a winter dance, and I will ask 
you, my friends, how we shall begin it. I want you to decide in regard 
to the manner of beginning the ceremonial. That is what I wanted to 
say to you, wa, wa." 

The men remained silent for about twenty minutes. Then Nu'xnemis, 
the chief of the winter dance of the Kue'xa, arose and said: "Indeed, 
Ho'LElite, you are always keeping the rules laid down in the times of 
our ancestors, for instead of beginning the ceremonial without notify- 
ing us, as others might do, you tell us of your plans and secrets as our 
forefathers used to do; and that is the right way." Then he turned to 
his own tribe the Kuc'xa and said : "Don't you feel glad that my friend 
Ho'LElite, the great magician, was kind enough not to keep his secrets, 
but let us share them? You also, La'mg-ala, ought to feel proud that 
he invited us to know of his plans. Do you not think that it would 
be best if the clothing of Winfi'lag-ilis were brought out by this secret 
meeting? You all know what I mean. The clothing of Wlnfi'lag-ilis 
consists of hemlock branches, and his play is AmE'lk" or NfiLanfiLdEls. 
The AmE'lk" must be shown at daybreak, and the NuLanuLdEls may 
be shown at any time of the day. I think it would be best to surprise 
our rivals, the Koskimo. Let us call all the men and women before 
daybreak to morrow and go to the meeting place which our forefiitheis 
used for the AmE'lk". You all know the rules of the AmE'lk". That 
is all. Now I have finished." 

Then Ho'LElite replied: "Thank you, my friends. Thank you, 
Nu'xnemis, for what you said. You are the only one who wants to 
keep the rules that were given to us by our ancestors. Friends, I want 
to ask you one favor: Arise before daylight. Tell me now if you are 
willing to do so and to follow our fiiend Nu'xnemis's advice. Let the 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 583 

women of your bousebolds kuow about this secret meeting and keep it 
from our rivals, tlie Koskimo. I will send two messengers in the 
morning to call you by tapping at your bedrooms. That is all. Now 
go home and have a short sleep." After this speech all went home. 

Xovemher 2-1. — Early in the morning IIo'LElite sent NoLElag-ilis and 
KuLE'm to call all the Kwakiutl. They went around and tapped at 
the outside walls of the bedrooms. The people arose at once and went 
out to the place where the AmE'lk" is held. This place is about 150 
yards from the east end of the village at the edge of the woods. The 
men went into the woods and cut off hemlock branches, from which 
they made head rings and neck rings; with these they adorned them- 
selves, as well as the women. Then Nu'xncmis told the people to get 
ready for the first cry, and he himself snug out "ho" as loud as he 
could. Then all the people beat the boards, Avhich were laid down at 
the place of meeting, and cried "he." Nest all the ha'mshamtsEs 
dancers — all of whom are women — were tied to a rope which was held 
by a man. The bear dancers were tied together in the same manner, 
and led by another man, one of the old bear dancers. Then the 
ha'mshamtsEs began to cry "wip wip" and the bears began to growl. 
Xow Nu'xnGmis sang out again, "ho;" the people beat the boards and 
responded by the cry "he." The ha'mshamtsEs began to cry "wip," 
tlie bears began to growl "wo ha," and the fool dancers cried "wihi'." 
After a short interval, Nu'xnemis sang out "ho" for the third time, 
and the people and the dancers responded in the same manner. Then, 
while the men were still beating time and while the various cries were 
being uttered, Ya/qois, the chief hfi'mats'a, rushed out of the woods, 
followed by his six attendants, and crying "hap, hap, hap, hap." He 
ran about among the people in a state of great excitement. 

Nu'xnemis spoke: "Let me ask you what has happened that Ya'qois 
should be so much excited?" Ho'LElite replied: "We have not been 
in the house of BaxbakualanuXsI''war'. But our friend Ya'qois has 
passed through it eight times. He knows all that belongs to the win- 
ter dance, and he knows all the mistakes that may be made. Ya'qois 
has seen that we have no chief t'o'X'uit among us to throw the super- 
natural power among our friends here, and that has made him wild. 
Therefore I will call someone who has been t'O'X'uit four times to be 
our chief in the AmE'lk"," Then he called a woman, saying: "Come, 
Wilanqoa'lag'ilis ! Take your place, for you were made t'o'X'uit by your 
lather four times, so that you are not afraid of anything." Then he 
called all the people to stand in a square, and the woman took her 
position in the middle. Upon Ho'LElite's command, the men com- 
menced to beat the boards. He asked K-rx- to step inside the square, 
and to show the woman what to do. He obeyed, and while the people 
were beating the boards K-ex- began to dance in a stooping position. 
He looked up and down and trembled while he was running backward 
and forward with short steps. Finally he turned to the right and

caiigbt the siipernatural power of the winter dauce between bis palms. 
Four times ]ie ran backward and forward, swinging bis bauds, tbe 
pahns of wbicb were pressed together, tbeii be tlirew it upon tbe peo- 
ple, wbo began to laiigb, while some cried '■'■ bap" and " wibi'." Now the 
woman was told to try to catch tbe supernatural power. She went 
through the same motions, and Avbeu she caught the spirit, the sound 
of whistles which she bad bidden in her mouth was beard. Four 
times she ran backward and forward, then she threw the supernatural 
power among tbe people, who stooped down at once. Then they began 
to laugh and to utter their cries. This continued for a few minutes, 
then she caught the spirit again, whereupon Nu'xuerais sung out ^'bo" 
for the fourth time. The people responded "be." 

Meanwhile the day had broken. The people arranged themselves in 
procession, which was led by Ya'qois and his attendants. They were 
followed by tbe bear dancers; then came the fool dancers and the 
ha'msbamtsEs, and finally, as a fourth group,. tbe people surround- 
ing the t'o'X'uit wbo bad thrown tbe supernatural power into them. 
Ya/qois first entered the house of ISTu^xncmis, followed by the rest of 
the procession. Wilauqoa'lag-ilis was tbe last to enter. She was 
accompanied by Ho'LElite and Nu'xnemis, who remained standing, 
one on each side of the doorway. As soon as she bad entered, she 
commenced singing her secret song: 

1. frieud! I have been made to set everything to rights. O friends! yo, yo, yo, 

yci, friend ! yo, yo, yo, yoi, frieud. 

2. O frieud! I carry in my hands the dances of my rivals. O friends! yo, yo, yo, 

yei, friend! yo, yo, yo, yci, friend. 

3. O friend ! They tried to strike me with the death hringer. O friends ! yo, yo, yo, 

yfi, frieud! yo, yo, yo, yei, frieud. 

4. O friend ! And the tire of death has been put into my hauds. O frieuds ! yo, yo, 

yo, yC-i, friend ! yo, yo, yo, yei, friend. 

She sang this song standing in the doorway, and during this time 
G'a'lg-alxola, wbo was standing among the people, said: "I am glad 
that you have come, and that you compel us to follow tbe laws of our 
ancestors; but sing louder, that we may know who you are." Then 
he turned to bis iieople and continued: ''Take care! Sometimes the 
t'o'X'uit will come to a bouse in wbicb there are many people and will 
benefit them, but generally tbey do harm to them." Then tbe woman 
stopped singing. Ho'LElite gave a signal to the people to beat time, 
and jSfu'xnr'mis cried "ho," as before. Tbe people responded "he," 
but kept on beating the boards. Tlien the t'o'X'uit went forward to 
tlie rear of the bouse, leaving tbe fire to her left. She moved in a 
stooping position, looked up and down, and finally caught tbe super- 
natural ])ower. Then tbe whistles were beard again. She tlirew it 
among the people, wbo first cried "ya," as though she bad missed tbem ; 
but then they began to utter their various cries. After a few minutes 
she took tbe spirit back again and all were quiet. 

Tlien G'a'lg-axola said : " What was the matter just now ? I told you 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 585 

to take good care and not to yield, and you seemed to liave lost your 
senses. Take better care the next time." 

Then they walked out of the house in the same order, the t'o'X'uit 
with her two attendants being the last. When Nu'xnemis left the 
house, he cried again "ho," and all the people responded "he," but 
the ha/mats'a cried "hap, hap, hap, hap," the bears cried "wo, ha," the 
fool dancers "wihT," and the ha'inshamtsEs "wip, wip," In this man- 
ner they visited four houses. lu each house the t'o'X'uit caught the 
supernatural power and threw it upon the people, as described hereto- 
fore. Every time she threw it the uproar increased. The people shook 
their blankets to indicate that the power had entered them. They 
laughed and cried, and kissed each other's wives, for during this time 
there is no jealousy and no quarreling. 

After they had visited four houses, Nu'xnemis led them back to the 
winter dancing house of Se'g-ag'ila. They were marching in the same 
order as before. Just before they entered, IJo'LElite spoke: "Friends, 
I missed one of our number." The people asked who it was, and he 
replied : " It is the son of our friend Se'g'ag-ila. The spirits have taken 
him away. Let us go into the house and see what we can do for our 
friend." Then the people entered. As soon as all were in, the whistles 
were heard in the ha'mats'a's room. Then Ho'LElite spoke: "Enter 
this house of our ancestors and observe the rules that were laid down 
for the winter ceremonial. Xow be happy. I thank you that you all 
have come to this morning's ceremonial, for I do not like to have the 
Koskimo or other strangers laugh at us. If any of you should have 
gone home before we finished, they might have had cause for doing so. 
We have done well, and the spirit of the winter dance is pleased with 
our work, else he would not have taken one of our number with liiin. 
Therefore I myself and my friend Nu'xnemis are pleased with you. We 
can not do anything without you, for what is the power of a chief 
without the help of his tribe? You call me and Nu'xuf'mis chiefs of the 
winter ceremonial, but we have no power without you. Now I have 
finished," Then Xu'xnemis sang out once more "ho," the t'o'X'uit 
repeated her secret song, and when she had finished Ho'LElite gave the 
signal for the people to beat the boards. She stretched her hands for- 
ward and caught the supernatural power in the same manner as de- 
scribed before, and threw it upon the people, who cried again. Three 
times she caught it and threw it upon the people. The fourth time 
after she had caught it she threw it up into the air. Then she snt 
down. 

Xow Ho'LElite arose and spoke : " O friends ! Do yon see how I look ? I 
am almost ready to run away from this house of the supernatural power. 
I was standing near the post and next to me was standing K-ex''s son. 
As soon as our friend Wllanqoa'lag-ilis caught the supernatural power 
the fourth time and threw it upward, it came and took the son of our 
chief K-ex* along. Friends, there was one taken away this morning, 



586 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1805. 

iiud a second one was taken just now, so there are two of our number 
missing to-day. If tlie supernatural power continues in this manner, 
Ave shall have no children left. Therefore 1 tliink I will go home and 
hide." When the people heard this, they cried: "Oh, do not go! 
What shall we do without you, the only one who can speak with the 
spirit of the winter dance." 

G-a'lg-axola said: "Indeed, lIo'LElitr', your words are true. But 
why do you want to run away and leave us in the dark ? Your name was 
given to our ancestors as a light by which to see the spirit of the win- 
ter dance, and you also, ISTu/xnemis, were made chief of the winter dance 
of the Kue'xa. If you run away, what can we do, for none of us can 
speak to the spirits as you two friends do. Take care, and let us stand 
our ground. Let us face the spirit of the red cedar bark. ISTow pass 
around the batons and let us sing the songs that onr grandfathers 
used in order to drive away the birds of the red cedar bark, for I am 
afraid of the way in which our people are disappearing to-day. Now 
I have finished." 

Then ]Sru'xnemi& called all the men together, struck the board once, 
and cried "wo wd ai." Then all the people struck the boards together 
and cried " wo wo ai a ai a k-as ai," beating time rapidly for a few min- 
utes. Then Nux'nemis struck the board Avith one sharp stroke and 
cried " wo." Then all the people did the same, all striking the boards at 
the same time with one short, loud rap. Immediately following this 
rap they beat the boards rapidly, crying "he," drawn out very long. 
Then they were quiet, but the whistles continued to be heard. 

G-a'lg-axola said: "You have failed to drive away the spirits with this 
song." Then Nu'xnemis gave another rap and cried "hamamama.'' 
Then all the people began to strike the boaids rapidly, and cried "hama 
ma ma ma ma," continuing to beat the boards for a few minutes. This 
cry is intended to drive away the grizzly bear. Then Xu'xnemis gave a 
short rap, crying at the same time "hamam," and all the people gave a 
short rap and cried " hama ma ma," and then ceased beating. The 
whistles were still heard. 

Then G-a'lg-axola said: "You have missed the spirit of the cedar 
bark again. Nu'xnemis struck the boards as before and cried 
"yihi i i i." Then the people took up the cry in the same manner as 
before, crying "yo hi i i i hii u u u," and again IS^u'xnrmis gave the signal 
to stop, as before, by the cry "yihi," and the jjeople finished, crying 
"yihi i i i hu fi u." Still the whistles continued to be heard. 

Again G-a'lg-axola said, "You missed the spirit again, for the whistles 
continue to sound. Now try to find a song that will drive them away." 
Now Nu'xnemis cried " wup," as before, and the people repeated " wu[), 
wup, wup." Nu'xnemis gave the signal to stop, as before, crying "wup," 
to which the people responded by crying "kux, wup, wup, wup." Now 
the sounds of the whistles began to grow a little weaker. 

Then G-a'lg-axola said: " Now you have hit the birds of the ceremo- 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 



587 



Dial for you liear that their cries have changed. Look out, Nu'xnemis 
anclHo'LElite, and you members of the seal society, and you que'qutsa." 
Then Nu'xnemis gave a new signal and began to sing, accompanied by 
all the people, who were beating time very rapidly. The song was as 
follows: 

Slide, Slide, Slide, etc.

At the end of the song the master of cer- 
emonies cried "hn;'' and when he had tiu- 
ished, all the people sang hii he. 

This song was repeated four times, and all this while the sound of 
the whistles was growing less and less. Finally, at the end of the last 
song, the people cried in response to Nu'xncmis's cry, "wo ha'he, wa 
wr/and with this the sound of the whistles ceased altogether. 

Then G-a'b-axola said : " Wa, wa ! I can not say much now, for we are 

surely all very hungry. But I will thank you for driving away the 

birds I am afraid of the way in which our children were taken away 

this morning. Our friend K-ex- has asked me to invite you, Ya'qois, to 

stay and to have something to eat, and all you, members of the seal 

society, and you, que/qutsa. Now take your seats." Then all the people 

sat down in their proper places, while Ya'qois retired to the secret room 

„f the luVmatsia in the rear of the house. Then K-ex- and his friends 

brouoht dry salmon and roasted it. They sent a piece to \aqo.s, 

and then distributed the rest among the members of the seal society 

and the que'qutsa. They sent a dish of grease to Ya'qois, and then 

gave the others in order, one dish to every four persons. After they 

had eaten, K-ex- asked them to keep their seats, as he intended to 

give another feast. H.VLElite, who acted as K-ex-'s speaker said: 

t'Now friends, my chief K-ex- is going to give another feast. Let us 

siuo- and let the world know that we are feasting. Pass the batons. 



588 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

We have much to do before this night." One man distributed the 
batons, and now Nu'xm'mis began the song of the hfi'mats'a Bu'bago- 
layu of the Ivne'xa, and the latter tribe sang as follows: 

1. You are lookini^' for food, great magician, hamf-. 

2. Sweet is wliat you will eat, great cannibal, Lauu'. 

3. You will swallow men alive, great cannibal, liamr. 

After the first song was finished, Nu'xnemis began another song of 
the same ha'mats'a, which was also sung by the Kue'xa: 

1. RaxbaknalannXsi wac was looking for food for me, liamai. 

2. BaxbakualanuXsrwac was looking for men for me, hamai. 

3. BaxbalvufilannXsi wac was looking for corpses forme; therefore you are feared 

by all, as you will devour men, bamai. 

4. Yes! all are afraid of you, eldest brother! Yon who empty the houses, great 

magician. 

After these two songs of the Kue'xa, the song maker of the Walas 
Kwakiutl commenced the following song: 

1. I want to eat you; I am a great magician. 

2. Your dance is getting greater all the time, you true dancer. 

3. Your dance is growing greater all the time, you true dancer. 

The second song of the Walas Kwakiutl was as follows: 

1. He cried hap for me, the great magician, hamamai. 

2. He sang the songs of the winter dance for me, the great magician ; liamai. 

3. I went through BaxbakualanuXsi'wae's house, the great magician's; hamamai. 

4. I went to the far end of our world. I am liked by all as far as the edge of our 

world. All try to imitate me; hamamai. 

While the last song was being sung, K-ex- and his friends were prei)ar- 
ing the berries. The dishes were placed in four rows, and two men were 
sent around to count the people by threes, while a third one distributed 
the spoons. Then K'cx- called Ho'LElite to come. He took up a dish 
and said : "Now friends, we are ready to eat. But I do not want to have 
any trouble. I want to keep the weather calm for our great friend 
Ya'qois, for if I do not give to him first he will grow as wild as the storm. 
This dish is for you, Ya'qois," Then he took up another dish and said: 
" Tins is for you, seals, and for your friends." Thus the dishes were all 
distributed, one being given to each three persons. Before they began 
to eat, a man was sent to Yfi/qois, to see if he had commenced eating. 
Soon he came back carrying the empty dish and laughing. He said: 
"Look at me, friends. Our great friend Y^a/qois must have been 
hungry, for his dish was emptied before I came to see him. Now eat, 
for you must be hungry also." Then all began to eat. 

Ho'LBlite arose, holding his speaker's staff, aud said: "Friends, I 
feel hap])y on account of this day's work. It seems to me I am seeing 
our grandfathers, and that pleases me much; and it must please you 
too, La'mg-ala; and you, La/LasqEin; and you, NE'msqEmut; and you, 
K-r-'qalc ; and you, Ts'i'lg-axsta. I know you all feel very happy to-day. 
Only do not forget the laws of our grandfathers. But I must not say 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 589 

that again, for you are keeping them well." While he was saying so, 
some of the old i)eople remarked: "Yes; it is true." And he con- 
cluded : " I know we are glad today. Now eat, for our chiefs food is 
sweet." 

Now the people ate, and when they had finished, most of them went 
home. The ha'mats'a's whistles were heard during this time in his 
room. 

About 2 p. m. the people came to fetch blankets, which were to be 
given away in honor of Ya'qois, in payment of his last ecstasy. When 
the blankets were being brought into the house, the tally keeper of the 
G'o'p'enox came in to look after the proper distribution of the blan- 
kets. He gave the names of the clans and tlie number of blankets which 
were to be given to each name in each clan. The blankets were 
arranged in such a manner that those intended for each clan were laid 
in the same direction, while those of the next clan were placed cross- 
wise on top of the preceding lot. Wherever a man was to receive 
blankets who still owed some to the giver, a number of sticks corre- 
sponding to the number of blankets due were ijlaced in the pile, which 
were given to the debtor as canceling tbe debt, according to the num- 
ber of sticks. After the pile intended for tbe G-d'p'enox was arranged, 
the tally keepers of the other tribes came in and looked after the blan- 
kets whu'h were to be given to them. In the evening a feast was given, 
tbe blankets were distributed, and shortly after the beginning of the 
feast the ha'mats'a Ya'qois came in and danced three times; the first 
and the second time in a squatting position with an ordinary blanket, 
but the third and fourth time in a standing position and wearing a 
Chilcat blanket. As everybody was tired on account of the long cere- 
monies of the preceding nights, the feast closed early. 

November 2i>. — Early in the morning T'd'kuiL, chief ot the Koskimo, 
sent his two speakers, A'Labala and WalkaLtsEmt, to the chiefs of the 
Kwakiutl, to inform them that on this day the Koskimo intended to 
perform their ceremonies, and requesting them to postpone their festi- 
vals to another day. They also asked them to keep the matter a secret 
from the yonng men. At the same time the speakers invited the 
Koskimo to come quietly to the house of their chief. At 8 o'clock they 
were assembled. Then a ha'niats'a was placed at the entrance, in order 
to prevent outsiders from coming in, and members of the tribe from leav- 
ing the honse. A'Labala, the first speaker of the Koskimo, arose and 
spoke in a low voice so that he could not be heard outside the house: 

"Koskimo, y(m have assembled in the dancing house of our grand- 
fathers. Thank you, friends, for having followed the first call of our 
chief T'o'kuiL. Listen to me, men, women, and children! You have 
the largest cedar bark in the whole world, and you keep the laws of 
your grandfathers more strictly than anyone else. We have two chiefs 
in our tribe, and therefore we can not be vanquished in our strife with 
property. Look out ! Do not let the Kwakiutl vanquish you, for they 



50O REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

are few only. See, how many you are ! There are enough Koskimo in 
this house to till the seats all around the walls. The Kwakiutl could 
not till one-half of the seats in this house. Therefore they can not 
van(|uish us. Take care, friends ! As I said before, we have a good 
tradition to follow. Therefore we can afford to laugh at them. The 
Kwakiutl say that we have no tradition, but our chief T'O'kuiL, who is 
going to give the ceremonial, belongs to the family of G'c'xdEn. You 
know that he had a ha'mats'a whose name was Nauayolis (the only 
one in the middle of the world). Who has a name as great as that? 
And if 1 should mention all the traditions and the great names of 
our grandfathers, the people would run into the woods, for they have 
no names like ours. Therefore, take care, friends! It is not my office 
to let you know the plans of our chief. I have said enougli.'' 

All were quiet for about half an hour. Then To'qoamalis, the chief 
keeper of the red cedar bark of the Koskimo, arose. He looked up to 
the roof and down to the tioor, and then said: 

"A'Labala, your words are true. You have seen part of my younger 
days, for you have seen my father. But you have not seen my grand- 
father. I have seen liim. His rules were strict, but those of my lather 
were a little less rigid. Our rules of the winter dance are nuich less 
strict than those of olden times. Thank you, A'Labala, for your speech. 
I paid close attention and found that you did not make a single mis- 
take. Now, friend A'Labala, look out and take notice of all I say in 
the speeches that I make during the winter ceremonial, at marriages, 
wlien the maniage money is refunded, and at sunnner festivals; for all 
these were learned from my great- grandfather. They were given to 
my father and to my great-grandfather at the beginning of the world 
by the Maker of Dances. Thus I obtained the large box in my house, 
in which I keep all the dances and the red cedar bark and the names 
and traditions of our great-grandfathers. After I am dead, I want you, 
A'Labala, to take my house and the large box in which [ am keeping 
the laws of our grandfathers. Kext winter we shall have the greatest 
winter dance that has ever been known, but I do not want to direct it, 
for I will give all my rights to you, friend A'Labala. After this winter 
you will have to ask his advice about everything, not mine. 

"Now I will speak about our present meeting, fori know you all wish 
to know its object. You can not know, for it is the office of the chief 
of the winter ceremonial to inform you. You know that I am the chief 
of the winter ceremonial. My name is To'qoamalis. It is renowned 
among all the tribes all around the world, for I have given blankets to 
all of them, and whenever I speak they all hear me. The spirit of the 
winter dance even hears me, and you also, my tribe, hear me. This is 
a secret meeting of our winter dance. You are aware that the grand- 
son of our chief T'o'kuiL has been taken away by the spirit, and that 
T'o'kuiL's sister was taken away at the same time. Last niglit Bax- 
bakualanuXsi'wae came to me and told me that these two have passed 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 591 

through all his customs and rules, and that they are on their way home. 
Therefore I have called you into our winter dance house, that you may 
prepare for them. They will make their appearance to-day. Keep 
yourselves in readiness. The spirit never lies, and BaxbakualanuX- 
si'wae does not keep the novices longer than four days, and it is four 
days to day since our children have disappeared, ISTow I have tinished." 

Every noW and then the old men would interrupt him, saying : ''Your 
words are true," or "Your words are good, chief," or "Go on! teach 
your children hov/ to speak." He remained standing a short while 
without speaking. 

Then T'o'kuiL came forth from behind a curtain that was stretched 
along the rear of the house, and said: "O Koskimo! I am pleased that 
you have come to this house. I did not put it up for myself; I did so 
for the greatness of your name. How glad I am, for I believe I heard 
our chief To'qoamalis say that BaxbakualauuXsi'wae came and told 
him that my grandson and my sister are on their way home. Is that 
true?" To'qoamalis replied: "It is true." Then T'o'kuiL continued : 
"Let them come, for I have my property in readiness." To'qoamalis 
said : "1 did not finish. Let our leaders prei)are to meet the two new 
ha'mats'as who are on their way home from BaxbakualanuXsT'wae, 
for they will be excited, and we must not call upon the que'qutsa to 
be the first to meet them. We must ask some who have greater powers. 
I will ask our friend the great Po'Xuiyalas, and her friend the great 
G-a'lolL, and the great KdkuiLala, and the great Q'e'q'anqoala, onr 
four mri'maq'as who have passed through the t'd'X'uit ceremonies to be 
our leaders. Xext shall follow the Hc'mElk, the old ha'mats'as. I 
will ask you, Xa'noqois, and you, great Xau'alg-is, and your friend the 
great Qoa'ts'amya, and your friend the great Qoa'yuqoalag-ilis, and 
your great friend Qoaxkue'k", and your great friend L'emElxa'lag-ilis, 
to follow tlie ma'maq'as to defend us from the wildness of the new 
hfi/mats'as. Xext I will ask you, Maa'myaank'^; you will form the third 
group. Dress yourselves as nicely as you can. You have heard the 
Kwakiatl say that we do not know how to arrange a winter ceremonial 
properly. Send someone to fetch button blankets from your houses 
and put them on. Last of all, I will ask you, que'qutsa. Two of you 
shall carry a plank on which the Maa'myaank" shall beat time to 
accompany their song. Two others shall carry a plank on which the 
ma'maq'as shall beat time to accomi)any their song, and you shall also 
carry a plank on which you shall beat time to accompany your own 
song. And one of you shall carry a skin drum. Onr friends the great 
ha/mats'as shall not sing, because they have to look after their whistles. 
There shall be four attendants for each of the new ha/mats'as, and I 
will nanie them now. You, He'lek-ats'e, K-a'qoLe, ALanudala, and 
your friend He'lekamig-alis, keep ready to attend the new ha'mats'a, 
who is going to come back to us to-day. You, Qoa'gis, Xalulala, 
X'i'x'eqala, and your friend, Lela'asnuk", keej) ready to attend the 



592 REPORT OF NATIONAL MTTSEUM, 1895. 

other lia'mats'a, wlio is going to come back to ns today. That is all. 
These are the rules of G-r''xdEn, who came down i'rom heaven. My 
grandiather was of the blood of tx-e^xdEii, according- to tlie tradition. 
Be very careful, for the Kwakiutl tribes will watch us closely. They 
will try to lind fault with our laws, for they have ways of their own 
which differ widely from ours. They have no winter ceremonial of 
their own, aud they will try to learn from us. I am not ashamed to show 
our winter ceremonial, for it is derived from tradition. That is all." 

With this he sat down and A'Labala arose. He said: '^O Koskimo! 
you have heard the rules of our grandfathers. Try to remember them, 
and do not forget what our chief has said, for he might die and 1 
might die as well, and then one of you must take my place. That is 
all, my grandchildren." 

Next La/gulag-ilis, the chief of the paiutiug, arose and said: To'qoa- 
malis, it is true what you said. We have traditions which teach us 
our laws. We are not like our rivals, the Kwakiutl. I tried to dis- 
cover the origin of their names which they use in the winter ceremo- 
nial, but no one could tell me, for they have no traditions. Therefore 
you, Jvoskimo, my tribe, may laugh at the little Kwakiutl; for each of 
our clans has a tradition, or even two, and we may justly be proud 
of it. Look at me and my name. According to the tradition that was 
told me by my grandfather, the tirst La'gulag'ilis was the chief of the 
paintings for the winter ceremonial. That is now my name. It 
belongs to the tradition of my clan, the G-e/xsEm. And my name has 
existed from the beginning of the world. When the Kwakintl desire 
to discover the true history of our ceremonials, tell them the tradition 
of (x-e/xdEn, for our chief, T'o'kuiL, is giving his winter ceremonial. 
Now take care, my tribe. You are aware that I am the chief of the 
paintings and of the ornaments of the que'qutsa. We are all pre- 
pared now, for we are painted with charcoal that we obtained from 
Ya/xstaL, according to the legend of the Naqo'mg-ilisala. You know 
how he obtained the tire of death from the wolves at -t)ayaiL. Yon 
also remember how he burnt his enemies to ashes and transformed 
them into stone by means of his tire of death. Our paint is that of 
Ya'xstaL, therefore we use only black paint and no red paint. The 
other tribes use very little charcoal and much red paint, because they 
have no traditions to guide them. I do not allow any red paint to be 
used in the winter ceremonial, because our traditions do not say any- 
thing about the use of red paint. Only the clan NaE'nsx-a are allowed 
to use red paint, for their chief, Nena'laats'eqa, used red i)aint in the 
dance no'uLEm, to indicate the blood of the tribes whom he had 
killed. Therefore they use no charcoal, but red paint only. They 
also use white paint in the no'uLEm dance, because Nena'laats'eqa 
brought this ceremonial down from heaven, and the white paint sym- 
bolizes the white clouds. All our ceremonials are founded on tradi- 
tions which our ancestors were careful to preserve. Now I have 
tinished my speech." (See p. 410 and tigs. 129-133, pp. 484-486.) 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 593 

Then G*ri/sa arose nnd said: "Did you hear the speech of our old 
chief? It made me feel proud and happy, for I am a young man and 
did not know liow we obtaiued our winter ceremonial. Let us remem- 
ber the speeches and traditions of our ancestors. Take care, ma'maq'as, 
ha/mats'as, maa'myaank", and you, que/qutsa of the Koskimo, Gua'ts'e- 
nox and L'a/sq'euox, for we are all one tribe now. Do not fall and do 
not laugh, that the Kwakiutl may not sneer at us. I am going to watch 
you carefully, and if I should see anyone breaking the laws of the win- 
ter ceremonial, he will be made a wa/tauEm. He will have to wear a 
long white feather and dance in all the houses of the Kwakiutl. After 
his dance he will have to distribute at least one hundred blankets. This 
will be the i:)unishment for any transgression of the rules of our 
ancestors." 

When lie had tinished, two men, Na/kuaLe and Walx-aLtsamt, entered, 
and the latter spoke: "Be quiet, slaves of the red cedar bark! I have 
seen our two chiefs who were taken away by (V'e'xdEn's Baxbakufilan- 
uXsi'wae. They look dreadful, dressed in ornaments of balsam pine. 
I narrowly escaped them.'' G'fi'sa asked, "Is that true?" When he 
said so, a man who was standing on the roof of the house secretly gave 
a signal to the two new ha'mats'as, who were waiting in the woods at 
the west end of the village. They rushed down to the beach, crying 
"hap, hap." When the people who were assembled in the house heard 
them, To'qoamalis sent G-a/sa to the roof of the house to look around. 
He came back and said : " Slaves of the red cedar bark, prepare to meet 
our two new ha'mats'as." 

Then the people left the house, the four ma'maq'as first. They were 
followed by the six ha'mats'as, who wore ornaments of red cedar bark 
and eagle down on their heads. Cedar bark was wound in four turns 
around their arms and legs. Next followed the inaa'myaank", tiie 
young women, who also wore rings of red cedar bark, but no arm rings 
or leg rings. They had a belt of cedar bark and wore button blan- 
kets. Their faces were painted black, with three horizontal lines (one 
over the eyebrows, one over the lower part of the nose, and one just 
under the mouth) and four vertical lines (one downward from the mid- 
dle of each lower eyelid, and one from the middle of each temple). When 
these three groups had left the house, the remaining qfie'qutsa shouted 
"yu" four times. Then they all rushed out of the house, and followed, 
in a separate group, the three preceding groups. The ma'maq'as were 
singing. The ha'mats'as walked on silently. Their heads and arms 
were held downward. The maa'myaank" were singing and dancing, 
and the que'qutsa cried "yu" every few minutes. 

When they had reached the new ha'mats'as, the four ma'maq'as sur- 
rounded them. The six old ha'mats'as formed a circle around the 
ma'maq'as. They in turn were surrounded by the maa'myaank", who 
held each other's hands. The que'(iutsa surrounded the last in a half 
circle, also holding each other's hands. Only the four speakers, Ma'a, 
NAT MUS i>5 38 



594 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

G'u/La, A'Labala, and Lo'Xoaxstaak", remained standing outside tbe 
circle. The last named shouted from time to time " we'i, we'i," stretch- 
ing his left hand upward, Avhile with his right hand he held the speaker's 
staff. The people responded by the cry "yfi." 

Then Ma'a spoke: "Friends, we have caught the grandson and the 
sister of our chief, wlio were taken away by BaxbakurilanuXsI'wae. 
We thought they might be dead and they might never return. What 
in the whole world can vanquish us? Even BaxbakualanuXsi'wae is 
unable to overcome us. I thought the Kwakiutl might have killed 
tliese two young people, because they can not overcome us in our war 
of property. I am glad that they were taken away by the spirit of the 
winter ceremonial. We are a long way from our village, and I believed 
that the spirit of the winter ceremonial had stayed behind, but he is fol- 
lowing us wherever we go. Now let us return to the woods and learn 
the song of our novices. BaxbakualanuXsi'wae gives four songs to all 
the novices who go to his house, and certainly he has given songs to 
these two." 

The two novices now ran back to the woods, crying "hap," and the 
people ran with them. Here they sat down. G-a/loiL and Qoaqoax-st'ala 
took their seats in the middle of the whole group. Then Ma'a said: 
"Now listen, Koskimo! I will ask our singing masters to sing four new 
songs for these hfi'mats'as. Try to learn them as quickly as you can. 
Sing! singing masters; and put some words against the Kwakiutl into 
your songs, G-a'loiL." The lirst singing master of the tribe commenced 
his song, and after he had sung one line, he began to beat time. The 
people joined him, and after he had sung through the whole song, they 
tried to sing it. Next Qoaqoax'St'ala sung his song in the same man- 
ner. Then G-a'loiL sang the third song, and finally Qoacjoax-sfala the 
last one. The two singing nmsters asked the people if they liked the 
songs, and T'o kniL thanked them, saying that they were just what he 
had wished for. Then the people arose, and started to return to the 
viUage in the order indicated in flg. 188. 

Before starting they all put on head rings and neck rings made of 
hemlock branches. As soon as they reached the village, Lo'Xoaxstaak" 
shouted "wei, wei," and all the que'qutsa responded "yu." Then the 
ha'mats'as began to run about and to dance in the circle, and the people 
struck up the new songs, beating time on boards that wore carried by 
some of the que'qutsa. The maa'myaank" also began to dance, and 
thus they proceeded until they reached the dancing house (Plate 45). 
The novices were the last to enter the house. There they danced 
around the fire. The maa'myaank" danced in their honor, and the old 
ha'mats'as joined their dance. After the second dance they were 
clothed by Mn'a, and then they began to dance more quietly. After 
the fourth dance they disappeared into their secret room. 

Now the Koskimo, Nfi'q'oaqtoq, and the Kwakiutl assembled on the 
beach and sat down in a square. A grandson of Wa'las, the Koskimo,

was going to buy a copper. A number of speeches were made, and a 
woman danced for Wfi'las, for whom the people sang- a song of joy. 
During the feast that followed this purchase, the ha'mats'as of tlie 
Koskimo sat on a platform with blackened faces, behind the que'qutsa. 
(Plate 40). 

The members of the seal society of the Kwakiutl were still confined 
to the dancing house, but every now and then they rushed out of it and 
knocked the people down. The ha'mats'as hit them, and they broke 
canoes, dishes, and other things. 

In the evening the Koskimo had their t'E'msEla. When the four 
messengers were sent out to invite the people, the host blew four times 
upon them, and their head rings were strewn with down. At this time 
the hfi'mats'a rushed out of his secret room, ran around the tire, and 
out of the door. As soon as he appeared, all the people who hap- 
pened to be in the house took up sticks, or whatever they could lay 
their hands on, and beat time rapidly. In the evening the people 
assembled. The Kwakiutl and XaAf oaqtoq took up the front corners.

Order of procession : (a) The novices; (b) the old. ha'mats'as; (c) the ma'niaq'as; ((/) the speakers; 
(m) the maa'myaauk" ; (q) the que'qutsa; (s) the singing masters. 

When all were assembled, the speakers of the Koskimo came in, 
their faces blackened. They were followed by a man carrying a ring- 
to which many small horns were attached. As soon as they entered, 
the people beat time and sang while thej^ were going to the rear of 
the house. Then the man who carried the ring went to the rear of the 
house singing- and beating time for himself. Another person, who 
held two lances wound with cedar bark, made a speech, which was fol- 
lowed by another song of the man wearing the head ring. After this 
the speaker took off the head ring and explained the meaning of the 
horns. He said: " These seven horns have been put on to the ring by 
BaxbakualauuXsi'wae. They belong to the ring of No'aqala, the 
ha/mats'a. He obtained it from G-e'xdEn. He had two neck rings 
which were held by the k-i'uqalaLala of BaxbakurilanuXsT'wac. The 
white rings which are fastened to his hemlock rings are the stars and 
the one in front is the sun. The red lines on his cheek are the blood

which flowed dowu where BaxbakurilanuXsi'wae rubbed G-e'xdEu. 
White cedar bark is flowing down from the rear part of his ring." 

Now people were heard singing outside, but before they entered some 
blankets were distributed. Three or four speakers who carried lances 
stepped into the doorway. Then a dancer entered singing; his whole 
face was bhickened. The speaker closed his mouth with his hands, 
compelling him to stop singing, and spoke to him. The dancer replied : 
''Nothing is heard." The speaker left him. He conthiued his song. 
Then he danced forward and raised his hands alternately. His song 
was not accompanied by any beating of time. His head ring had a 
horn in front. During this time the speakers were talking. Finally 
the dancer was taken to the rear of the Are by the speaker who held 
the lance. Now the singers began to sing again. QE'ldetsEm and 
another old man performed a dance, and blankets were given away. 
Some blankets were held around the tire while the distribution was 
going on. During this time the speaker who carried the lances went 
to the door and four women went out. 

Now the speaker ordered the people to sing, and a ha/mats'a, accom- 
panied by one assistant, entered. The beating of time continued for 
some time before the singing began. When the ha'mats'a had reached 
the rear of the house, seven women entered dancing. One of them 
remained standing near the door, while the others danced around the 
fire. In the dances of the Koskimo, one woman, whose duty it is to 
sing all the secret songs, remains standing in the doorway during the 
whole ceremony. At the end of the second dance of the ha'mats'a 
some of the women danced out of the house again. After his first 
circuit the ha'mats'a danced once to the right and once to the left, in 
the rear of the house, and disappeared behind the curtain. 

Now blankets were again distributed in honor of the preceding 
dance. Again the women were heard singing outside. They entered, 
dressed in blankets, and imitating the motions of birds, and thus they 
danced to the rear of the house, where they remained standing. They 
were followed by the speaker, who carried the lance. One of them sang, 
while the others danced in the rear of the house. Then blankets were 
distributed among the Na'q'oaqtoq. Next a speaker whose face was 
blackened went out. 

Then the ma'maq'a entered, wearing a blanket. Men and women 
were talking to him. He put his hands on a baby that was sitting 
in the lap of its mother, and blew on it. Then he spoke in front of 
the curtain, and the people replied "wo." Next QE'ldetsEm appeared 
from behind the curtain, dancing. He was followed by the speaker 
carrying a lance and a man who carried his child on his arms. The 
child wore a ha'mats'a head mask. After they had gone around the 
fire once, the singers began their song and the women danced. Some 
speeches followed. 

Now the arrival of new dancers was announced. A ha'mats'a entered 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 597 

with liis assistants. The people sang for hiui. After he had danced 
around the fire once in a squatting position, he danced a second circuit 
standing-. He wore a short blanket and dancing apron, a thin round 
neck ring, and a fiat head ring with small white rings on the front and 
sides. During his dance he squatted down every now and then and 
danced a few steps in long leaps. Finally ho disappeared behind the 
curtain. His mother remained standing in the doorway and danced for 
him. Again the speaker delivered a si>eech and began to distribute 
blankets. By this time it was half i)ast eleven. 

The women had become hungry, and were eating in the rear of the 
house, and uttering the calls of their societies every now and then. 

A new dancer was announced. The singers began to beat time, and 
a woman, a t'rt'X'uit, entered dancing, her palms stretched forward 
and upward. A second woman, and two men who carried guns and 
blankets, followed her. She was painted black in the following man- 
ner : Her right cheek was all black, w^hile on the left cheek two vertical 
lines extended down the whole face near the nose. Two horizontal 
lines ran from the lips to the ear, one a little above, the other a little 
below, the month. A long conversation developed between herself 
and the speaker. The people beat time twice. They divided into 
two parties and discussed how they would try her. One party went 
to the door and fetched weapons, saying that they w^ould kill her, 
to see if her guardian spirit would protect her. Others said they 
would much rather split her. Then the mother-in-law of the t'o'X'uit 
stepped between the two parties and asked them rather to kill her; 
but when she was beginning to strip oft" her blanket and shirt they ridi- 
culed her, asking if she was not ashamed to strip in front of so many 
people, and led her away. The young w^oman spoke again. Then the 
men went out. The speakers who held their lances talked, and after a 
short time the three men returned. Some men holding paddles and 
staffs were standing in the front row in the rear of the house. Then a 
woman and a girl ran out of the door and great excitement prevailed 
among the i)eople in the rear of the house. One man cried: "I am 
the si'siuL.'' Now the t'o'X'uit took off her blanket and shirt and sat 
down. Then they led a girl around the tire to the rear of the house. 
The girl carried a knife. During this time one of the Koskimo women 
was singing. Now the si)eaker, whose face was blackened, took a 
paddle out of the hands of one of the men. The woman sat down in 
the rear of the fire, in front of the singers. lie stepped up to her 
while the other woman was dancing, her hands raised and trembling. 
Four times the man went around the woman. Every time he stood 
beiiind her he raised his paddle as though he was going to strike her. 
The fourth time he really struck her and the paddle entered deeply 
into her shoulder and blood was seen to flow down. Now grease was 
poured into the fire, so that the liouse was lit up, and the woman arose 
and turned slowly, that everybody might see the paddle sticking in her 



598 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

slioiilder. The singers were beating time, and sLe sat down again. 
The paddle was pnlled out, apparently witli great ditliculty. The 
shamans stepped up to her and cried "hoi, hoi, hdifff," and blew upon 
her. Now the people began a song, during which the shamans con- 
tinued to sing over her. QE'ldetsEm also put his hands on her head 
and chest and shoulders, crying "hoi, hoi, hoifff." While this was 
going on, some of the women arose from their places and danced. 
Then the two shamans who had been working over her, raised her to 
her feet, and led her around the fire. The blood had ceased to flow, 
but a dee}) cut, beginning at the right breast and going across her 
shoulder far down the back, was clearly visible. Then all the people 
cried "hu," and she went out. Now a Na'q'oaqtoq spoke, and blankets 
were distributed. 

At 12.30 a new dance began. The girl who in the preceding dance 
had carried a knife came from beliind the curtain and danced. A 
number of women danced in her honor, and the same old woman who 
had stayed in the doorway continued dancing there. One old woman 
was dancing, holding her pipe in her month. A song was sung, and 
then one of the Koskimo delivered another speech, holding a short staff 
in his hands. Whenever a name was called, he raised the staff high 
and held it so that the ends rested against his palms. 

As the people became hungry by tliis time, a woman threw dried 
salmon among the people, first to the members of the secret society of 
the Koskimo, then to the others. When they were eating, the societies 
again uttered their calls. 

Now a new dance was announced. A woman entered, wearing a flat 
ring, the front of which was set with feathers. She carried a bundle of 
red cedar bark in her hands. Her eyes and cheeks were painted black. 
When she was shaking the bundle of bark, it gave a rattling noise. The 
Iteople gave her a pipe, a stick, and other things, and whatever she 
carried gave a rattling noise. The peoi)le took it from her again, but 
were unable to produce the same sound. Tlien they beat time again. 
She went once around the fire, looking upward and shaking her bundle 
of bark, and holding it as though she Avas going to throw it. Then she 
stood in the rear of the fire and sang her song. She gave her cedar bark 
to one of the messengers and took a staff in its place, which she carried 
around the fire and made it rattle; another person tried it, but it did 
not give a sound. Next she took a pipe of one of the NaAj'oaqtoq and 
made it rattle in the same manner. Then she disappeared behind the 
curtain.' After some speeches, four young men went out, and several 
old people followed them, bringing food. 

Then members of the Wa'tanEm danced. After their dance more 
blankets were distributed. While the people were still eating, whistles 
imitating the raven's cry were heard outside. This was about 1.30 a. m. 
Tlio speaker asked the people to beat time. Then the ha/inats'a entered 

1 See page 492. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS, 599 

with four assistants, who, however, had no rattles. Two women danced 
in his honor. During the second song' a great many women were 
dancing for him. Two bloody lines were painted on each cheek, run- 
ning in a wide circle downward from the corners of the mouth to the 
eyebrows. He came in, in a great state of excitement, and attacked 
his assistants, who were iu front of him. After three songs he was led 
out of the house. This dance ended at 2 o'clock, and more blankets 
were distributed. 

A new dance was announ(;ed, and a ha'mats'a entered, his face 
painted all black. A hemlock braucli was fastened in front of his 
head ring. The front of his blanket was adorned with small white 
rings. (^E'ldetsEm pointed out the blanket and said that it was the 
blanket of G'e'xdEn. He danced four times. At his third dance he 
wore a blanket which showed the si'siuL around its border. In the 
mnldle of the back was painted a squatting man whose palms were 
represented by carved wooden skulls which were sewed onto the blan- 
ket. The knees and the head were represented in the same way. One 
carved skull was also sewed onto the blanket on each side, outside the 
figures. He also wore a carved skull iu front and one in the back of his 
cedar bark head ring. When he came in, five old ha/mats'as danced for 
him, while three stood iu the door iu order to prevent people from going 
out. Six songs were sung for him. During the first and second songs 
one woman was dancing for him. After his dances he was led out of 
the house. The speaker addressed the people, who beat time and said 
"hu.'' 

Now the sound of whistles and the cries of a ha'mats'a were heard 
outside. The same ha'mats'a reentered, and danced one circuit and a 
half around the tire, while the women were dancing in his honor. His 
k-i'nqalaLala danced in front of him. When they stopped in the rear 
of the house, both squatted down, and their attendants stood around 
them. After the fourth dance they disappeared behind the curtain. 
Then more blankets were distributed. 

At 3.15 women were heard singing outside. A man entered singing, 
followed by a woman. Two pairs of bloody lines were drawn on her 
cheeks, running downward in a wide circle from the mouth to the ear. 
She sang her secret song. She danced as t'd'X'uit, trying to catch her 
supernatural power. As soon as she moved her hands upward, trying 
to catch it, the women began to dance in her honor. Now she caught 
it between her hands and threw it forward. At once a Hying sI'siuL 
was seen in the rear of the house, moving rapidly to the right and to 
the left and trembling all the time. As soon as the si'siuL disappeared 
again, all the danciug women put their palms together as though tbey 
had caught the supernatural power. Then blankets were distributed. 

At 4 o'clock a woman came from behind the curtain, singing. She 
was followed by a ghost dancer, who had a large thick ring of cedar 
bark with an enormous horn in front, set with feathers, whicli were 



600 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, l«9r>. 

waving to and fro on long shafts. It bad a long trail behind. The 
speaker followed her. The people sang and women danced in her honor. 
She disappeared behind the cnrtain, and blankets were distributed 
again. 

Now a song was heard* ontside. The speaker asked the singers to 
beat time, A man entered singing. His body was naked, but he wore 
a dancing apron and had cedar bark rings around his arms and wrists. 
He was a Ba'bakuaiiLa, a t'o'X'uit. After some speeches there was sing- 
ing, and a woman and a man danced. They held their elbows close to 
their sides, stretched their hands forward, the palms upward, and moved 
the hands up and down in jerky motions. Tlie Ba'bakuafiLa was then 
placed on a seat behind the fire in front of the singers and the speaker 
was asked to pierce him with his lance. The singers beat time, the 
speaker took up the lance aiul threw its point against the floor, to show 
that the lance was solid, and showed it around among the people. Then 
he took up the lance and walked around the Ba'bakuauLa. After 
each circuit he put the point against the left side of Ba'bakuauLa, and 
then continued his circuit. After he had gone around him four times, 
lie once more put the lance against his left side and began to push it 
in. Ap])arently the ])oint entered the body, blood ^Yas streaming out 
of his side, and as the point j)enetrated farther the Ba'bakuauLa appar- 
ently collapsed. Finally the whole length of the lance had pierced the 
body and the point was seen to come out on the right side a little below 
the arm pit.' He was raised so that the i)eople could see his body. 
Then the lance was pulled out again slowly. The shamans were called, 
and blew and sang over his body, while the singers continued their 
song. Then he was led behind the curtain. After this, cloths were 
distributed among the women ; the singers beat time and cried " hu." 

Tins was the last dance of the night. The Koskimo did not allow 
their guests to go home, but invited them to stay for a feast. The 
ha/mats'a still remained sitting in front of the door, preventing anyone 
from going out. They continued to eat and to make speeches until 10 
o'clock, when everybody went home to take a rest. 

On the l*6th of ISTovember everything was quiet, as the people were 
exhausted by the preceding festivals. 

In the afternoon of the 27th, the Kwakiuti held a secret meeting in 
order to determine what to do. The seal society was still confined to 
the dancing house. K-ex-, whose mask had broken a few days ago 
during the dance, was going to initiate his son in atonement for this 
mishap. Ilis elder son had died a few years before, after he had been 
made a member of the ha'mats'a society. Eeferring to this, he spoke 

'The Ba'bakuafiLa had a small hook attached to his right arm ring l>y means of 
which he pulled up the skin of his chest below the right arm jiit, piercing at the 
same time a small bag filled with blood which was fastened to the skin, so that the 
blood was seen llowing down his side. This scene seems to be the same as that of 
the dance described on p. 575. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 601 

in the secret meeting about as follows: "Kwakiutl, give my son long 
life! Once I tried to make my son a lia'mats'a, but the deadly Bax- 
bakualanuXsrwae struck liim and he died. When he died, I resolved 
not to make another child ha'mats'a, but now since the mask broke you 
all request me to initiate my younger son. T shall do so, but do give 
him long life." At this poiut Si'wite, an old blind man, interrui)ted 
him, saying: "Don't be overbearing and don't let him have more than 
two songs," meaning that if he gave him four songs the boy should die. 
Then all the people scolded and blamed him on account of his merciless 
words. Kow it was arranged what dances were to be shown and who 
was to pay for them. In the evening of this day, K-ex-'s wife disap- 
peared all of a sudden. Her clothing was found on the beach, and it 
Avas announced that she was to return as q'o'miuoqa on the following 
day. lu the evening the Kwakiutl held their k-ik-i'lnala in order 
to bring back their novices. I will give only a brief description of 
their festival, as the details resemble that of the Koskimo. In the 
beginning the societies came in one after the other — first the killer 
whales, then the birds, etc. One man came in alone carrying a staff as 
though he was shooting with it, and crying "hfi." The people sang 
when he came in. Then they tore blankets and distributed the strips. 
About 11 o'clock in the evening K-ex- appeared carrying several spread 
tongs, while others followed him carrying staffs which they held 
stretcbed forward. They wore plain head rings. The spread tongs were 
given away. They designated gifts of canoes. At this time La'g-us 
delivered a speech. Xow all had assembled except the members of the 
seal society. They came in last and stepped to the rear of the house, 
while Ho'LElite made a speech. 

Now began the dances. The fool dancers were heard outside, and 
they entered wearing masks and enormous noses. One of them had 
his face painted black and red. The people sang and tlie women 
danced. xVfter this dance Ila/misilak" gave away a gun and blanket. 
A man carrying a rattle was stationed in the doorway, and announced 
with his rattle the arrival of every new dancer. After every dance, 
blankets were distributed or other j^resents were made, but I shall not 
describe this every time. The distribution of blankets occupied by far 
the greater portion of the night. 

The next dancer was an old woman, bent by age, who came in. Her 
face was painted red and black. 

After a speech, made l)y La'g-us, a bear dancer came in. His face 
was all black. He wore an enormous head ring. Two men followed 
him and carried the blankets which were given away after his dance. 
As soon as these blankets were distributed, a young bear dancer 
appeared from the corner of the house and scratched the ground while 
the people were singing and women Avere dancing for him. Then he 
disa])peared again. 

About midnight a new fool dancer entered, led by a blanket which 



602 REPORT OF NATIOffAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

was tiecl around his waist, and the people sang. After his circuit he 
disappeared behiud the curtaiu. Ilii'masaqa delivered a speech for him. 
He said: "The time of lighting has passed. The fool dancer repre- 
sents the warriors, but we do not fight now with weapons ; we fight with 
property." These words referred to the fact that the man whose place 
this dancer had taken had killed a chief of the Nanai'mo and many 
others. Then Ha'masaqa turned to the Koskimo and said: " It is not 
right that in your k-ikn'lnala you distributed many blankets. It is 
not customary to do so, but now I will show you Avhat we can do."' 

Next a bear dancer entered, wearing a copper around his neck. He 
was followed by two men who carried blankets. Wojnen danced for 
him. Now E'wanuXts'c took the copper and spoke. He gave it to the 
Na'q'oacjtoq. This copper had been given by a Na/q'oaqtoq to his Kwa- 
kiutl wife. Now the Na/q'oaqtoq had to redeem it by a payment of 700 
blankets. In his speech E'wanuXts'e held it by its lower end, thus 
indicating that he was going to take not more than half the i)rice of 
the copper as payment in full. After this La'g-us, who was now stand- 
ing in the doorway, delivered a speech. He said: ''What is the matter 
with our house! It is shaking."^ 

Next another bear entered. Ho was caught by K-cx* and led to the 
rear of the house while the peoi^le were singing. After a speech made 
by Hii'masaqa, another bear dancer entered, followed by a wonmu who 
carried a copper. Her mother danced, and during her dance a fool 
dancer was heard outside. Ln/g-us spoke, holding the copper. Then 
he gave it to Ho'LElite, who replied. K-ex* handed a number of bun- 
dles of sticks to Ho'LElite, Avho spoke about them and distributed them. 
Then he returned the copper to La'g-us, who took it to a fool dancer. 

About 1 o'clock another fool dancer entered, who was brought to the 
rear of the house by K-ex-. 

By this time a man carrying his baby appeared as fool dancer, coming 
from the rear corner of the house. 

Next another fool dancer entered, and then a bear, who was led by a 
blanket which was tied around his waist. The man who led him wore 
a large neck ring of hemlock branches, which represented a copper that 
was to be given away for the bear dancer. A speech was made, and 
the ring was thrown into the fire. 

At this moment the whistles of the ha'mats'a were heard. All of a 
suddeu Ya/qois became excited and jumped down from his seat. His 
assistants and two k-i'nqalaLala rushed after him, and after he had 
danced around the fire once they all went out of the house. 

At 2 a. m. another fool dancer wearing a large nose entered. After 
one circuit he ran out and came back without a mask while the people 
were singing. 

Next a boy who was to be a pa'xala dancer was brought forward

'^Meaning that the weight of the blankets which were piled up in it made it shake. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. <J03 

from tlie rear of the house. The inau who carried him turned ouce iu 
the rear of the house, and once in front. The boy was said to see some- 
thing' supernatural coming, and was carried out of the house. 

After blankets were distributed the ha'mats'a reentered, the Ic-i'n- 
qahxLahi dancing- before liim. 

Next a bear dancer entered, dressed in a complete bear skin, to which 
a mask was attached. The women danced for him, holding their hands 
close to the body, not raised, as is usually the case. After one circuit 
the bear left the house again. 

About 3.30 a. m. two women entered, the first wearing a wide ring 
of cedar bark. The following dancer was a ha'mshamtsEs, who danced 
with short, quick steps without moving her body. She wore a head ring 
set with ermine, and a button blanket ornamented with a thunder bird 
and a killer whale. She had two heavy black lines running down her 
face, and two horizontal ones crossing them. She left the house after 
one circuit. 

The next dancer was a girl, who was ushered iu by her father. The 
people were singing and the girl's mother stepped up to her, encour- 
aging her to dance, but as she could not induce the child to do so, 
she danced herself, wearing a red blanker. IS^ow Hii'masaqa made a 
speech. 

About 5 oclock in the morning two ha'mshamtsEs entered. They 
were followed by the ha'mats'a, accompanied by four assistants. 

The next dancer was hai'alik-ilaL. She cried "sh, hdip, hoip." 
She wore a large ring of red cedar bark having four vertical horns, which 
extended downward in long tassels of bark. She had a large round 
neck ring. Her blanket was set with tassels made of red and white 
bark. Attached to the back part of her rings was a tie looking like a 
cross. The two messengers who stood at the door led her around the 
fire once. Then she went out again. After a short time she reentered. 

At 0.15 a. m. a ha/mshamtsEs, wearing a round neck ring set with 
four tassels, danced. The two messengers led her around the fire, then 
she went out again. They returned and spoke to Ho'LElite. After 
this the pe(Ji)le beat time and the dancers disappeared. 

Atr).3() a new dancer appeared, wearing hendock branches around 
his head and neck. He danced with short, quick steps, and was led by 
the two messengers to the rear of the house. He wore a blue blanket 
and a dancing apron set with shells. He was the pa'xalalaL, He 
danced in the rear of the house without moving from his place; his 
whole body was shaking. Two songs were sung for him and the women 
danced. After a speech made by Ho'LElite he left the house again. 

The next dancer was a Ts'd'noqoa, who entered dressed in a bearskin, 
which was attached to her mask. She rubbed her eyes and shouted 
"ou, on." Then the people sang, and she went out again. 

A new song which was heard at the door, was taken up by the 



604 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

singers in the rear of the house. A t'o'X'nit woman, wearing a head ring 
of hemlock branches, but no neck ring, api)eared. She hekl her elbows 
to her sides, and her hands forward, palms npward. She raised them 
and lowered them alternately. The song was in a three -part rhythm, and 
she walked limping, one step being on the quarter mora of the rhythm, 
the second step on the half mora of the rhythm, while she was singing 
her secret song. After each line of her song the chorus continued it. 
She sang: " Ya, ya, ye." 

Now Hd'LElitc stepped up to her and spoke. She replied with the 
exclamation "up, up," pointing to her chest, meaning that the people 
should split her. Then she moved her hands in the same way along her 
neck, meaning that they should cut off her head. Hd'LElitr* proposed 
to throw her into the fire, but after some talk this idea was abandoned. 
The people beat time again. Slie began to dance, and caught her super- 
natural power between her palms. After she had done so twice, she 
said again ''up, up," touching her stomach with her palms several 
times, meaning "take out my intestines." Then she tried again to catch 
her supernatural power, and during this time IIo'LElitc walked around 
her, shouting "up." Now she tried the fourth time to catch her super- 
]iatural power. At once whistles were heard. A bird was seen flying 
down from the roof, and a nd'nLEmg'ila figure arose from underground. 
The fourth time a feather, which represents the horn of the sT'siuL, 
came up from underground and moved trembling along the rear of the 
house. She went up to it, and all of a sudden she began to disappear 
in the ground. One man took hold of her, trying to rescue her, but 
his hands and forearms disappeared in the ground down to his elbows. 
Several men took hold of him in order to rescue him. Then he was 
apparently dragged through the whole house by the t'd'X'uit, who 
had disappeared underground. He passed by circuitous movements 
through the whole house, plowing up the ground. Finally he seemed 
to lose the woman, and fell backward.^ 

After the t'd'X'uit had disappeared in the ground, a second one 
commenced to dance. The underground motions of the first were led 
by the dancing woman, who, with the movements of her hands, tried 
to bring her up again. This second t'o'X'uit was followed by one man. 
Finally she left the house, and blankets were distributed while Ho'le- 
lite delivered a speech. Now a song was heard on the beach outside 



This peifoiaiauce had been prepared during the preceding days, when the raem- 
l)ers of the seal society kept everybody away from the house. A deep ditch had been 
dug in the rear of the house, iu wliich the t'o'X'ult disappeared. A shallow ditch had 
been dug all through the house. A heavy rope had been placed in this ditch, which 
was filled with loose dirt. The man who seemed to hold the t'o'X'ult pulled himself 
along this rope. Unfortunately the rope had been laid too near the fireplace and 
was burnt. Thus it happened that the man had to let go. The origiuiil plan was to 
pursue the t'o'X'uU to the front right corner of the house, where she was to ajipear 
again from out of another ditch which was connected with the ditch iu the rear of 
the house where she had disappeared. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 605 

the house. A messenger ran around the tire, went out of the house, 
and returned. 

Xext La'g-us entered, ]ioldin<^ a broken copper in his teeth. He was 
followed by a girl. Then one man entered who Avore a neck ring. lie 
had two companions who carried rattles. Another man carrying a 
copper plate, and two more men, followed. The people sang a ha/mats'a 
song. The girl wore a head ring with ermine trimmings and large 
abalone shells. She moved her hands like a ha'mats'a. She was clad 
in a button blanket with ermine trimmings. Now La/g-us broke off a 
piece of tlie copper and. threw blankets into the fire. All this time her 
mother carried the rattle. The girl went out again. 

Next Ho'LElitO took a rattle, turned, and went around the fire twice. 
Then he listened to see if the new ha/mats'a was coming back. He 
listened three times. Now whistles were heard, and the noise of a man 
running round the roof of the house. Suddenly the roof boards were 
pushed aside. A boy jumped down with a head ring of hemlock and 
quartz crystals attached along the median line of his head. He had an 
apron of hemlock branches. He jumped first upon the roof of the bed- 
rooms in the rear of the house, and from there down to the floor. He 
danced, his hands close to the rear side of his thighs, running with short 
quick steps and bending rhythmically. Then he ran out. He was the 
^Ma'tEm. As soon as he left the house the ha'mats'a cried "hap." 
Nu'xncmis then made a speech. The whistles of the ha/mats'a were 
heard in the door, where the k-inqalaLala appeared singing. The 
assistants surrounded the ha'mats'a and ran with him around the fire. 
Then they went out. Now blankets were carried into the house, and 
the new ha/mats'a appeared naked, and danced. His ki'uqalaLala were 
singing and dancing before him. This ended the festival. 

Decemhcr 3. — The Kwakiutl gave the dance Walas'axa'. The people 
assembled in the evening in the dancing house of the Kwakiutl. A 
curtain was drawn right acros-s the rear of the house, behind which 
the members of the seal society first disappeared. After one of the 
Koskimo had given away some blankets, a fool dancer came out at 
the rear right-hand corner of the curtain and danced around the fire. 
A few women danced for him. Then he disappeared again behind the 
curtain. K'wanuXts'e and his speaker remained standing during this 
dance and the following ones, facing the curtain in front of which the 
singers were sitting. The next dancer was a bear, who also appeared 
from behind the curtain. Then the people sang and an old woman 
danced for him. 

After some blankets had been distributed, a ha'mshamtsEs song- 
was struck up, and a woman, accom])anied by two assistants, appeared 
from behind the curtain. She wore the ha'mshamtsEs head ring and 
neck ring. The same old woman who had danced before and several 
others da.nced tor her. Her movements were similar to those of the 
ha'mats'a, but she did not tremble. During the first line of the song 



606 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

slie raised her bauds aud danced in the same manner as tlie other women 
do. Slie disappeared, and after some speeches a new song was sung 
and she came out again with three assistants. 

Now the Walas'axa', the dance of the clan G'l'g-ilqam, commenced. 
Nii'xnemis aud two messengers stood at the right-hand rear entrance 
of the curtain. He gave a signal for the singers to beat time and to 
sing, and out came a great many of the members of the Kwakiutl 
tribe, wearing wolf headdresses. They were about fifty in all, and as 
soon as they had stepped out from behind the curtain they turned 
around and began a procession around the fire. In front of the fire 
they turned again and continued their circuit. They held their fists 
in front of their l)odies, the thumbs turned upward. While they were 
walking, they cried " you, hou." After they had gone around the tire 
they disappeared again behind the left entrance of the curtain. La'g-us 
made a speech, and then they began a second circuit in the same 
iiiaiiuer as before. When they had made their fourth circuit, they 
stopped before entering the ])artitioii again. They kneeled around the 
fire, resting on their fists and knees. Now Nu'xnemis began a song, 
which was accompanied by rhythmical motions. They made another 
circuit and disappeared behind the curtain (Plate 30). 

XI. Ceremonials of the other Tribes of Kwakiutl Lineage. 

The winter dance of the Koskimo begins in the month of November. 
In the evening, before the ceremonies are to begin, a number of boys are 
sent out to gather kelp. Thej^ return during the night and enter the 
village at the south end, blowing on the tubes of kelp, and produ- 
cing a noise like that of large horns. At the same time a drum is 
placed in the river so that the wooden band is in the water while the 
skin is held just above the surface. The beating of this drum pro- 
duces a very loud sound. As soon a^s the young men have passed 
through the village, they stop blowing their kelp horns and the drum 
stops at the same time. Then all the people in the houses begin to 
sing their secret songs, and continue to sing until the njorning, when 
they come out of the houses. Then the chiefs go from house to house 
and ask the people if they know what produced the noise of the pre- 
ceding night. Some will reply that they did not hear it, others that 
they heard it, and still others that tliey had seen one of their dead 
relatives, who told them that he and the other ghosts came to take 
the son or the daughter of one of the inhabitants away. The chiefs 
continue to go from house to house until they come to that of the 
young manor young woman who is to be initiated during the following 
ceremonies. When they enter his room, they see that he has dis- 
appeared. Only his shirt and blanket remain. These are covered 
with blood. The chief seizes the garments, takes them out of the 
house, and calls all the people together, asking for the murderer of the 
youth. A great commotion ensues, all the people running about. At 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 607 

last tliey begin to blacken tlieir faces and take tlieir weapons, ready 
to fight among tlieniseU'CS. 

iSTow all of a sudden a person is beard to cry on the point of land at 
the west end of the village, "hamamamama." The people at once go 
to see who is there. Now the master of ceremonies of the winter 
dance, whose name is Ama/k, rises, and begins to call all the people by 
their winter names. The people are surprised at his doing so, and 
object. He, however, does not listen to them, and merely warns them 
not to be bitten by the Ha/maa. Then lie calls four men whose names 
are Loakwaxstaok, WalkaLtsnmt, A'Labala, and Hena/wa, and asks 
them to go in a canoe to the point of land where the sound was heard, 
in order to ascertain what produced it. The four men rise and enter 
the house, in which the ha'mats'a assemble at the same time. Soon 
they come out again, their faces blackened, rings of red cedar bark 
around their heads and around their necks, and paddles in their hands. 
The people inquire why they are dressed up in this manner, to which 
they reply that it is a protection against the lurking danger at the 
point of land to which they are going. They go down to a canoe and 
paddle slowly to the point of land. As soon as they ap]iroach it, the 
sound "hamamamama''' is heard again. The men pretend to be scared, 
and paddle back to the beach. They ask some of the Idlo'LalaL, or 
ghost dancers, to go with them. 

Then the master of ceremonies asks four of the lolo'LahiL to accom- 
pany the four men. The lolo'LalaL dress up and sit close together in 
the middle of the canoe while the four men are paddling toward the 
point. As soon as they approach it the same sound is heard. Then 
the men in the bow of the canoe paddle backward while the steersman 
paddles forward and brings the canoe up to the point of land. As 
soon as they touch the land the four lulo'LalaL jump ashore and run 
into the woods, where they stay for a few minutes. Then they come 
back to the canoe and sit down in the same place as before. The other 
four men appear to be scared, but not a word is said. They paddle 
back to the village, and when they come to the shore, they inform the 
master of ceremonies that they shall not go back again, because they 
are too much scared. Upon a question of the master of ceremonies 
they say that they did not see anything, but that the sound scared 
them. He compels them to return and to investigate the cause of the 
noise. The Idlo'LalaL have stayed in the canoe all this time, waiting 
for the other four men to return. They paddle back to the point of land, 
and the four Idlo'LalaL jump ashore again and run into the M^oods, 
where they stay a few minutes. They come back, sit down in tlie 
middle of the canoe, and the four men paddle back again to the village. 
Now the four Idlo'LalaL jump ashore and go into the house of the 
father of the young man who had disappeared. The lour paddlers rise 
and say that they have seen the missing youth among the ghosts at the 
point. The people all go into the hous(i of the master of ceremonies 



608 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

and take their seats. The master addresses tlieni, asking tbem to get 
ready to light tlie ghosts. He calls four ya'lakuenox (men who have 
secret songs), and bids them to stand in their places — that is, one in 
each corner of the house. Now the master of ceremonies takes a raven 
rattle and steps to the singer standing in the right-hand front corner 
of the house. He gives him the rattle and asks him to sing the ghost 
song : " Lo ho ho ho lo ho ho ho he hama ma." When he has linished this 
song, the singer turns to the right, says "hamamamama," and retnrns 
the rattle to the master of ceremonies, who goes diagonally across the 
house to the left-hand rear corner. He gives the rattle to the man 
standing there, who repeats the same song, turns around, says ''hama- 
mamama," and returns the rattle to the master of ceremonies, who goes 
to the left hand front corner of the house and repeats the same ceremony 
there. Last he goes across to the right-hand rear corner of the house 
and gives the rattle to the fourth singer, who repeats the same song, 
singing, however, louder and turning faster than the others. After 
this has been done, tlie four men sit down again. Now the master of 
ceremonies requests the people to get their ornaments of red cedar 
bark and to dress uj). The people take them out from under their 
blankets and put them on. Then he asks the father of the novice to 
get some eagle down and to strew it on the heads of the people. 
After this has been done, he orders the lolo'LalaL to assemble in one 
place in the house. He nmkes the ha'mats'a assemble in another place; 
the liai'alik-ilaL, i^a'xalalaL, ya'yatalaL, na'naualaq, se/ilis, ts'e'kois, 
xoe'LxoeLawatala, hfi/winalaL, lo'kwasola (or lalaxsola) all assemble. 

Then he asks the people to prepare to fight the ghosts. All of them 
leave the house and go down to the canoes, each society in a canoe by 
themselves. Only the ha'mats'a and the he'lig-a stay ashore. They 
paddle toward the point where the cry of the ghosts was heard, and as 
soon as they i-each there, they hear again somebody calling " hamama- 
mama." The peoide look frightened. Some jump into the water, others 
faint, and all pretend not to know what they are doing. Only the 
canoe in which the lolo'LalaL are assembled goes on undisturbed. 
They go asshore and take the novice, who had disappeared, from among 
the ghosts. They bring him down to their canoe and paddle slowly 
back toward the village. During this time all the other canoes are 
drifting with the tide, as the people have not recovered from their 
fright. As soon as the lolo'LalaL land, the ha'mats'as, who are expect- 
ing them, begin to get excited and run down to the beach. Then the 
master of ceremonies orders a man, whose name is LaliLqotsastala, to 
bring the other canoes back. He takes a small canoe, paddles out 
toward the canoes, and brings them back one by one. As soon as they 
laud, the lolo'LalaL go down and carry the people up to the house as 
though they were dead. Then the lolo'LalaL shamans try to restore 
them to life, while at the same time the ha'mats'as are running from 
house to house excited, driving the people out as soon as they have 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 609 

been restored by tlie efforts of the sluim;iiis. This continues until the 
mil'maq'a rises and sings liis song, dancing around the lire. He is con- 
sidered more powerful than the ha/mats'a, and l)y his song compels 
liim to leave the liouse. 

Then all the people go to their houses and have their breakfast. In 
tlie evening the ye'wix-ila invites the tribe to his house. Then they 
begin to sing the song of the ghosts, as follows: " Lo ho ho il, lo ho 
ho u, Id ho ho a hu oinama.'' This song is repeated four times. As 
soon as they stop, the master of ceremonies addresses the people, saying 
that they will try to restore the youth ayIio had been taken away by 
the ghosts. While he is talking, somebody is heard to cry " hamama- 
mama" outside the house. They look about as though they were fright- 
ened, and ask each other what may be the cause of the noise. The 
sound is heard fonr times; then an old man jumps into the door and 
informs the people that the lolo'LalaL are approaching, and requests 
the people to have their batons ready to beat time. As soon as he has 
finished speaking, the door opens and the lOlo'i.alaL enter crying 
"hamamamama." The i)eople repeat the cry and begin to beat time. 
The ghost dancers enter and dance in a stooping position. They wear 
rings of cedar bark on their heads, from which a veil of split white 
bark is hanging down over their faces. They go around the fire until 
they come to the left-hand corner of the house. Here they sit down in 
a circle crying again "hamamamama." When they become silent, the 
master of ceremonies a.sks La/liLqotsastala to see if the ghosts have 
come with the dancers. As soon as he approaches them, they begin to 
cry again " hamamamama," but he does not stop. He stex)s up to them, 
sits down among them and looks for the ghosts. After a short while, 
he returns to the master of ceremonies and says that he has seen some 
of his dead relatives in a hole in the ground, and that the lolo'LalaL 
were sitting around the hole and talking to the ghosts. He asks the 
master of ceremonies for a strong rope. The latter calls a man whose 
name is Tsaksta/lacjoals to get the rope which his grandfather left 
him. This means that this oftice is hereditary. Tsaksta/laqoals goes 
and brings the rope into the house. He also brings twenty blankets, 
which are called the weight of the rope of the ghosts. The master of 
ceremonies gives one end of the rope to one of the lolo'LalaL. The 
latter pretends to tie the end of the rope arouud the waist of the new 
lolo'LalaL in order to prevent his being taken away by the ghosts. 

As soon as this is done, the tribe divide into two groups, the clan 
of the ye'wix-ila and their rivals. The latter sit close to the door. 
Then the master of ceremonies gives the twenty blankets to the rivals. 
After this he calls up all the ba'akwas — i. e., those who belong to 
the clan of the y«"''wix'ila. As soon as they take hold of the rope, the 
ye'wix-ila distributes blankets among his rival clan. Then he calls 
upon the i)eople of his clan to touch the rope. They come one after tlie 
other and distribute blankets anu)ng the other clan. Last of all the

chief comes, Avho gives away tweuty blankets. Tlie blankets wliicb are 
given away are sup]iosed to be a weight attached to the rope, and the 
last gift of twenty blankets breaks the rope. 

Tlien one of the members of the rival clan jumps up. He takes liold 
of the broken rope, and while he is holding it calls the chief of his own 
clan to fetch the rope which he inherited from his grandfather. The 
chief returns with the rope and twenty blankets. He ties the two broken 
ends together with his rope and says that he will be able to bring the 
ghost out of the ground. He calls his clan to leave the door and to come 
to the rear of the house. Now the ye'wix-ila's clan take their seat near 
the door. The other clan goes through the same ceremony, and last of 
all the chief brings forty blankets, which cause the rope to break. This 
means that the clan whose rope did not break until forty blankets were 
attached to it is more powerful than the other one. After the rope 
breaks, the whole tribe sings as follows:' 

liOok up to our world, look up to our world ! Chief! Procurer of Avealth ! 

This song is repeated four times. The ye'wix-ila distributes more 
blankets among the i)eople, who then go home. On the following day 
the lolo'LalaL are seen to walk about the village with rough rings of 
cedar bark on their heads, the latter being strewn with down, and their 
faces blackened. About midnight of this day a number of men secretly 
climb the roofs of the houses of the village and begin to whirl the whirr- 
ing sticks"^. (fig. 189). The noise of these sticks is supposed to be 
the voice of Hai'aLihujas or Wina'lag-ilis, who comes to take away 
another novice. This noise is repeated four times, each time for about 
ten minutes. Then the people must sing their secret songs in the 
houses. When the noise stops, a ha'mats'a is heard to shout in the 
bush, and on the next morning a blanket is found in front of one of the 
houses. Tlie people gather around it and try to discover whose 
blanket it is. After they have ascertained the owner of the blanket, 
they say, " It was certainly he whom we heard in the woods," and his 
father adds that Hai'aLilaqas probably came and has taken his son 
to BaxbaknfdanuXsT'wae. The people request him to clean his house 
and prepare for the return of the novice. The man goes into his house 
at once, cleans it, and as soon as he is ready, the people enter. He asks 
them to be ready for the return of the ha'mats'a, as he might come back 
unexpectedly. The master of ceremonies asks the singing master to 
sing the new songs tor the ha'mats'a, of which there are four. After 
the singing master has sung these songs, the master of ceremonies 
requests the new ye'wix-ila to prepare a feast. The people take their 
places and begin to sing the four songs of the old ha/mats-a. After 
these are sung, the feast is spread. When the people have entered, the 
old ha'mats'a comes out of his room and drives them out of the house

aud into the water, where he keeps them until the ma'maq'a appeals 
and drives the hfi'mats'a back into the house. 

During these days the second yc'wix-ila is collecting all the debts 
which are due him, and on the following morning the new ha/mats'a 
is seen on the same point of land where tlie first one was recovered. 
The people go up to him, catch him, and bring him to the singing 
house (kekoalela'tse). Then they all begin to sing the four new songs, 
the first two accompanied by fast beating, the last two by slow beat- 
ing. After these songs the ha'mats'a is led back into his bedroom. 
About 8 o'clock in the evening he leaves the house, 
returns to the woods, and stays there until his father 
has invited all the people to his house to sing for 
him. As soon as they are assembled they begin to 
beat time." After they have done so for about five 
minutes, one man cries "yau." The people repeat 
this cry four times. They have hardly done so when 
the hiVmats'a enters and they begin to sing. The 
ha/mats'a dances around the fire and at the end of 
the last song disappears in his bedroom. This night 
all the dances are shown in a festival similar to the 
k'ik'i'lnala of the Kwakiutl.' 

On the following morning the ye'M'ix-ila invites all 
the peoj)le to his house, and gives a feast to the men, 
women, aud children. At the end of the feast every- 
body receives a blanket "to wipe the mouth with." 
After this the hfi'mats'a is allowed to bite four times, 
once every fourth day. During this time he is 
purified in a way similar to that of the hil'mats'a of 
the Kwakiutl. 

After the last night of the winter dance, the ye' • 
wix'ila calls all the people to his house and asks them 
who is willing to keep the red cedar bark until the 
next year. No one responds. All of a sudden the 
door is o])ened and about twenty men rush into the 
house. They are covered with balsam pine branches, 
and blood is dripping from their bodies. They are called the Wina/- 
lag'ilis or qumqu'mx-dd (land otters). They run around the fire and 
suddenly take the cedar bark rings from the heads of several men. 
They then leave the house again as suddenly as they entered. The 
men whose cedar bark rings they have taken will give a winter dance 
the following year. After this, the rest of the people take off their 
cedar bark ornaments, tie handkerchiefs around their heads, and begin 
to sing summer songs.

612 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

During- a feast the young man who is to be initiated suddeuly faints. 
At once a number of newly initiated shamans are called to investigate 
the cause of his sickness. They are unable to ascertain what ails the 
young man, and send for the older shamans. Tliey feel all over the body 
of the youth, and finally declare that the spirit Wina'lag-ilis has taken 
possession of him. Then a sail is stretched across the rear of the house 
and the patient is placed behind it. The house is cleaned, and every- 
body is invited — men, women, and children. Henceforth this house 
will be the dancing house. The q'a'qanas, who corres^wnd to the 
me'cm(ioat of the Kwakiutl, must stay in this house after they have 
once entered it until the end of the whole ceremoniah The profane 
are not allowed to pass the front of the house above high-water mark. 

The master of ceremonies asks the people to sing the following song, 
which is supposed to have the power of restoring the patient to life: 

Hayas ahuno lalii ya liouo haiiil Liiu. 
Do not cry, yon will come back safely.' 

An old shaman stands by the patient, feeling his body. The song iias 
no effect upon the young man, and the master of ceremonies requests 
the people to try another means of restoring him to life. Boxes are 
placed in front of all the assembled people, and at a signal they beat 
time rapidlj' with their batons, ending with a loud nip. This is repeated 
four times. 

The above song belongs to the clan Naa'nqaenox (always staying at 
home), while the beating of time belongs to the clan La'lauiLEla, who 
obtained it from the Awi'k*'enox. The shaman says that the beating 
of time had the desired eftect upon the patient. After this the people 
assume their winter names and rearrange themselves in groups as 
enumerated on page 419. 

On the same night the festival called qap'e'k" is celebrated. In the 
morning of this day a number of young men were sent out to collect 
alder bark and to make red cedar bark, which is distributed among the 
people in the evening. In payment for their services they receive a 
special allotment of f iod. When the people assemble for the qap'e'k", 
the highest ha'mats'a is first led to his seat. The other ha/mats'as are 
l)laced at his side. They are folio w^ed by the ts'e'kois and by the 
hai'alik-alaL. The (jue^qutsa take their seats last. They sit on each 
side near the door. As many que'qutsa as there are ha'mats'as are 
charged with the making of the head rings of the latter. These que'- 
qutsa all stand on the right-hand side of the door, each holding his 
ring. They have a leader, whose office is hereditary. They walk around 
the fire four times, singing. Then they step in front of the ha'mats'as, 
and on a signal they all put the neck rings around them. At a sec- 
ond signal they put the head rings on the heads of the ha'mats'as, 
and finally they strew their heads with down. Then the ha'mats'a's 
whistle is heard, and the people distribute quickly the red cedar bark 

1 Appendix, page 728. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 613 

among- the others. The qiie'<iutsa. blacken their faces. The ha/mats'a 
begins to get excited and bites the people. He innst bite a certain 
man tirst, whose dnty it is to offer himself to the ha'mats'a Avheu he 
gets excited for the first time. This oflice or duty is hereditary. The 
ha'raats'a carries a stick and drives the people around tlie fire. During 
the ensuing excitement another novice disappears, leaving his blood- 
covered blanket behind. It is found, and under great excitement 
inquiries are made as to who is missing, until finally the father exclaims 
that his child has disappeared. Then the ha'mshamtsEs dances. 

Sometimes the disappearance of the novice takes place in a different 
way. Four men go on the roof of the house during the night and, 
running about, cry " hm hm hm." This noise is taken by the people to 
signify the approach of Wiua'lagMlis. On the following morning it is 
found that one of the young men has disappeared, leaving his blanket 
behind, which is covered with blood. 

Still another way of beginning the Le'xalak" is the following: The 
ma/maq'a dances in his house, and suddenly throws his magic stick, 
which is believed to fly through the walls of the house and to hit the 
person who is to l)e initiated and who lives in another house. The 
youth falls down, and then the parents call the shaman to cure him. 
The ceremony continues as described above. 

To return to the festival. After the ha'mshamtsEs has finished his 
dance and has bitten a i^erson, the people begin eating. They do not 
feed the ha/mats'a firvSt, as is done by the Kwakiutl. Then they sing 
four times the song of the Naa'nqaenox ;' three times they sing the 
burdeu only, the fourth time they sing the words: 

])o not cry, you will come back safely. 

This is the end of the ceremonies of the first night. On the second 
and third night the same songs are repeated. Every night the shaman 
visits the novice, who is hidden behind the curtain. He reports that 
he is feeling better, and the third night he says that he is shaking 
violently. 

The fourth night the same songs are repeated. The shaman visits 
the novice again, and when he returns, he says, ^'Listen: he is singing 
his secret song," Now nobody is allowed to speak or to cough. Then 
they hear, as though from a great distance, the sound of a new song, 
which is growing louder and louder. The secret song is sung four 
times. The singing master must listen attentively, because after the 
fourth time he must repeat it. Two new songs are heard that night. 
On the following night the same ceremony is repeated, and two more 
songs are learned by the people. Twelve (lue'qutsa women dance this 
night. Tlieir faces are blackened and they wear red cedar bark. 
Their dance is accompanied by the beating of batons. One man and 
one woman are stationed at the entrance to the secret room in which 
the novice is lying, in order to watch it. Their offices are hereditary. 

' See page (>12. 



614 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

When tlie twelve women are about to fiuish their daiice, the novice 
is seen to come out of his secret room. He does not wear any orna- 
ments of red cedar bark. 

He dances on the four following nights. On the following day there 
is an intermission of the ceremonies. The next day the ye'wix-ila 
invites all the people to his house and asks them to prepare for the 
purification of the novice, whicli will take place on the fourth day. 
He also requests three otticers whose offices are hereditary to pre- 
pare themselves for this ceremony. These officers are the man who 
makes the tongs, his name is Q'aqia's; the one who uses the tongs, 
his name is JSlE'msqEmg'ala; and the one who calls the people to the 
washing. Early in the morning of the fourth day the last-named 
officer must go to every house, and, beating the doors with his baton, 
he must cry, "Yau, yau, listen, listen. There is food for you from 
(QoiVyukolax-ilis), from (iia'xus'EmL)."' The first is the q'a'q'anas 
name, the second the que'qutsa name, of the novice. In the evening- 
all the people assemble in the dancing house. Then the first of these 
men makes a pair of tongs, which are wound with red and white cedar 
bark and put up on the west side of the house. A ladder which has 
only four steps is placed against one of tlie rafters on the left-hand 
side of the fire (that is, to the left when facing the rear of the house). 
The man who made the ladder climbs it, and puts his head through the 
roof. When he comes down, the people beat the boards and the drum. 
At midnight he ascends the ladder again. He goes up a third time 
between midnight and dawn, and the fourth time when the day begins 
to dawn. This is to secure good weather. Every time when he comes 
back, he sings: 

Ha, ba! you do uot give me. a favorable answer, you wbo are to bring tbo soutbeast 
wind liy wasbiug our novice. - 

The officer who made the ladder is given a dish in payment for his 
work. The one who made the tongs receives a knife and a hammer. 
The one who carries the tongs receives a belt; another belt is given to 
the officer who invited the people. Sometimes paddles, canoes, or 
blankets are given to them, but these are always called dish, knife, or 
belt, as the case may be. 

After the man has come down the ladder the fourth time, NE'msqEm- 
g-ala takes the tongs down and goes around the fire four times, hold- 
ing the tongs stretched forward. lie calls a man to open the door, and 
strikes the stick which is spreading the tongs four times. The fourth 
time he hits it so that it flies out of the door. Then betakes two stones out 
of the fire, one after the other, repeating the motion three times in each 
case before actually taking them u\). He throws them into the water in 
the same way, and dips them up also after having repeated the motion 



'Yau, yau, yauxtaxoLai' yauxtaxoLai', bamaylLaai qa (Qoa'yfikrdax-ilisa:') le 
(7axus'EinLai'). 
* Appendix, page 729. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 615 

three times, really dipping up tlie water the fourth time. The novice 
sits right uext to the bucket iu which the water is kept. He has no 
rings of red cedar bark. Then he is washed. 

Then NE'msqEmg-ala places the tongs vertically into the tire, the 
open end downward. The cedar bark with which they are wound 
catches fire, and then he lets them go. It is expected that the wind 
will blow in whichever direction they fall. Then the officer who made 
the tongs makes head rings of red cedar bark for all the people, who 
put them on. The singing master makes a new song, and singing it 
they go around the fire, and leave the house, led by the yiai'atahiL, who 
carries a small rattle. This office is also hereditary. They go through 
the whole village, and inform the ])eople that the purification of the 
novice has been performed that morning. The people put their masks 
in order, and gather the property which they are going to give away at 
the festival which is to be held that evening. This.uight the people 
are not arranged according to the groups described above, but accord" 
ing to their clans. In the morning a man is sent around to call the 
people. He says, "Let us go into the house and beat the boards, for 
we have purified him. Let us go at once.'' ' 

First the boys enter the house and begin to beat time. Then the 
various groups enter one after the other, each carrying the property 
which they are going to give away during the festival. Whenever a 
group enters, the boys beat time. They imitate the movements of the 
auinjals which they represent. Then each group gives presents to 
the others, and at this time the ha'mats'a, ma/maq'a, and the other 
q'a/q'anas, pay for the damage they have done. Next, three men 
are called up, — ME'lxmEk", aKaqo'mg-ilisala; Ts'e'Ic, a G-e'xsEm; and 
Tsau'xstalag-ilis, a G-I'g-ilqam, — who each sing a song, accompanied by 
the people. ME'lxmEk"'s song is as follows:^ 

I will listen to the old tale to which this refers. 
I will listeu to what is told about it. 

After they have finished their songs, a man named Wlyo'tsEm is 
called up. He puts on a canoe sail like a blanket, and goes around 
the fire dragging the sail behind him. This means tliat he is sweep- 
ing the house for the dancers, who will enter next. The first dancer to 
enter is the wa'tanEm. He is followed by the ghost dancer, the o'lala, 
hai'alik-aue, ts'e'kois, wi'x'sa ha/mats'a (==hamtsEtsr»e), and ha'mats'a. 

While the ha'mats'a is biting the people, the ma/maq"a enters and 
drives the ha'mats'a away. Then the new dancer comes out of his 
secret room. If he has a mask, he returns to his secret room and dances 
again. Four women dance with him, two in each corner in the rear of 

'La luKus lag-aaLtsaLai', gins kuexaleLg'ai', xg'ins kuesasoxtEg-ai'. Halag-i-

the house, while the novice is dauciug iu the middle of the rear of the 
liouse. The dauce is accompanied by two new songs and by the two 
songs that were used at the ceremonial of purification. While he is 
dancing, the yO'wix-ila distributes his presents among the people. On 
the following day another man gives a feast in the house of the 
ye'wix-ila. When all the people have entered the house, the novice 
is called to come out of his secret room. The people sing one song, 
and he dances alone and sits down. Again his father distributes pres- 
ents among the other clans. The novice is allowed to take part iu the 
feast. During the four following days the novice wears head rings 
of red cedar bark. After four days, another man gives a feast in the 
same house. AVhen all have entered, the novice is called out of his 
secret room. He wears a smaller head ring now\ Two more feasts are 
given in the same way at intervals of four days. Every time the dancer 
wears a smaller head ring. 

At the end of the last night the (j'a'q'anas, who have stayed in the 
dancing house right through the whole ceremonial, are led home by 
their wives. 

It will be noticed that in these ceremonials the festival corresponding 
to the k-ik*i'lnala of the Kwakiutl is celebrated after the return of the 
novice. Among the La'Lasiqoala when the novice has disapi)eared in 
the woods (being a lii'xsa), his whistles are suddenly heard on the roof 
of the house or behind the houses. At night, while the people are 
assembled, he is heard on the roof of the house, but disappears again. 
On the following morning he is seen on a point of land. Four canoes 
are lashed together and connected by planks. Thus the people paddle 
up to him and bring him back. The same night all the dances are 
performed. 

The winter dauce ceremonies of the Ts'a'watEouox differ from those 
described heretofore. I have received from Mr. Hunt detailed informa- 
tion only in regard to the closing ceremonies, while the progress of the 
ceremonial seems to be much like that of the Kwakiutl. The beginning 
is as follows: 

The ye/wix-ila invites all the people to his house, where they sit dowu 
according to their clans. Then he asks his wife to bring food. While 
the food is being prepared, the people sing. In the middle of the third 
song the whistles are heard on the roof of the house. The people 
stop singing. They group themselves at once according to their 
dances and societies. They burn the salmon, because it was prepared 
before the beginning of the winter dance. That night they begin their 
ceremonies. 

On March 14, 1805, they concluded their cereuumies as follows: 

I'a'xalats'e, chief of the T'Ena'xtax, gave away blankets during the 
winter ceremonial. At night two men went into every house, and said 
at the door: "Now we will tame your dancer, Ts'a/m<joagaLr'. Xow 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. (1 1 7 

we will tame your dancer, Isra,'uts'e. Now we will see the dauce of 
Laqoasalag'ilis. Now we will >see the dance of yakamausa'lagnlis." 

Then the otiier one said, "Be quick now, dancers ! We will assemble, 
friends, while it is day/' and they went back to the dancing house. 

After some time the two men went again to every house, and the first 
one said: "We come back to call you." The second one said: "Now 
let us go to the house, dancers. It is late in the evening. We have 
no fuel, friends. Let us all go together." Thus they said at every 
bouse, and went back to the dancing house. 

Then the two men went again and looked about in the house and 
said: "Now all our friends are in;" and when they discovered that 
some one was missing they went to him and said: "You are the only 
one who is still missing." 

When they were all in, Pa'xalats'e arose and spoke: "I thank you, 
my great friends, that you have come to our dancing house. Remain 
here in the dancing house of i)a'mtalaL, the great shaman, who van- 
quished our Master, (^Vaniqilak", at Ts'a'wate. This is the winter dancing 
house of Nau'alagumqa, the great shaman at Ts'a/wate. This is the 
winter dancing house of Ba'Lalag-ilak", who gained victory over 
We'qae of the Le'kwiltoq (see p. 41()). Those whom I named had 
large cedar bark ornaments. Thus we say, La'mgal; thus we say, 
Nu'xnemis. Therefore I gain the victory over the chiefs of all the 
tribes, for in the beginning they were vanquished by jga'mtalaL and 
Nau'alagumqa and BaLa'lag-ilak". Now take care, my friends!" He 
turned to his tribe and said to them, "I say so, Ta'mXuak'asj I say 
so, Xu'gamsila; I say so, P'a'lxalasqam; I say so, Le'na; I say so, my 
friends. Now take care, my great friends; give me my rattle that I 
may call the spirit of the ceremonial. Therefore I tell you to be care- 
ful, friends." They gave him the rattle; he shook it and sang "hoip, 
op, op, op." He stopped and looked upward as though he was expect- 
ing the spirit. The chiefs said: "Take care, friend, else you might not 
get the spirit of the winter ceremonial." Again he shook his rattle 
and sang the secret song of Ts'awata'lalis: 

1. Now listen! ya, ya, ya, greatest of all dancers! Ha wo. 

2. Now sing! ya, ya, ya, greatest of all dancers I Hawo. 

3. Now sing your song, ya, ya, j'a, greatest of all dancers ! Hawo. 

4. Now he comes to me, ya, ya, ya, greatest of all dancers! Hawo. 

Then he ended his song, and the cries of many ha'mats'as were 
heard among the trees. Thej' cried "wip, wip, wip, wip," like the 
ha'mshamtsEs. 

As soon as the cries ceased, Ta'mXuak-as spoke : " Friends on the 
other side of the house, did you hear what we obtained from our grand- 
fathers? You heard that it belongs to the earliest legends of the 
world. Now take care, friends, we do not need to be frightened of 
anything, because, as you heard, my great cedar bark ring came to me 
from my grandfather." Then Pa'xalats'c shook his rattle again and 



618 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

sang the same song as before. Wlieu lie stopped singing, the cry of 
the ha'mshamtsEs was heard again near the house. 

Now Pa'xalats'e shook his rattle again and sang his secret song. 
When he stopped, the cry " wip, wip, wip" was heard just behind the 
dancing house. He sang his secret song a fourth time. Then the cry 
"wip, wip, wip" was heard at the door of the house. The first of the 
dancers entered and sang his secret song. Tliey were all dressed in 
hemlock branches, which were wound around their heads and necks. 
This is the secret song of their leader: 

1. Now listen, ana,' ana' to uiy shaman's soug. Aua', ana' liainamamfi, hamaujania'. 

2. Now listen to the cry of the ha'mat'sa, because I am a cannibal, because I am a 

shaman, ana, ana, hamamama, hamamama, hamamama. 

Then the leader, Ts'e'koa by name, stopped singing. When became 
near the fire, to the middle of the house, he turned, and at the same 
time said "hoi'p, hoi'p, hoi'p." Thus forty men came into the house, 
while the old men who were sitting in the rear of the house began to 
beat time. They went around the fire in a squatting position. Next, 
a woman came. Her name was Yfi/kusElag-ilis. She had hemlock 
branches around her neck. She sang the secret song of Nau'alagumqa: 

1. Hama! I was made a magician by the greatest of the dancers. 

2. Hama! I was filled with magic by the greatest of the dancers. 

When she stopped singing, she turned and all cried "wip, Avip, wip, 
wip." Forty women were standing in the house. The old men began 
to sing the song of Jc)a'mtalaL, which he sang in his contest with 
Qa'niqilak" at Ts'a'wate, according to the tradition, when he gained 
the victory over Qa'niqilak", at the time when they tried each other. 
This is the song which he made against Qa'niqilak": 

1. A small magician was he as compared to me. 

2. The small magician Avaa afraid of me. 

3. I called his name, the name of the small magician. 

4. And he tried to tame this greatest of all dancers. 

When she stopped singing, Ts'e'koa repeated his secret song. After 
this song all the men and women turned to the left and cried " wip, 
wip, wip." Then the old men repeated j^a'mtalaL's song. When they 
stopped, Ts'e'koa repeated the song of Ba'Lalag-ilak, the same which 
he had sung when entering the house. When he had finished his 
song, all the men and women turned to the left and said "hoi'p, wip, 
wip, wip." Once more the old men sang the song of x)a'mtalaL. After 
their song, Ts'e'koa repeated Ba'Lalag-ilak "'s song. All the men turned 
to the left. The old men repeated the song which i^a'nitalaL sang in 
his contest with (^ri'niqilak". 

Then Ml the men and" women who had danced went out of the house, 
and Ta'mXuak'as spoke : " Wa, wa, friends. Did you see this ! What 
you have seen, friends, on the other side of the house, that is what 
we are afraid of; that is what makes life short; that is our Lord; that 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 619 

is what we inherited from our grandfathers; that is our history; that is 
the great magician; that is x^a'mtalaL, the great magician; the woman 
is Nau'alagnmqa. That is Ba'Lalag-ilak" ; that is x)a'mtalaL, who gained 
the victory over Qa'niqilak" at Ts'a'wate, and that is the cause why all 
the tribes are vanquished by us, wa, wa. That is what I say, friends, 
for Pa'xala<ts'e. The songs which you have heard are those of jc)a'm- 
talaL. That is his dance. The secret song of the leader is the secret 
song of Ba/Lalag-ilak", and the secret song of the woman is that of 
Nau'alagum(|a. 1 do not use new ways. The other tribes may invent 
new things, wa, wa. " 

Now the boards of the house front were struck, and the people said: 
"The cormorants are going to dive!'' Then Xu'gamsila entered the 
house and said: "Beat the boards, friends." The old men beat the 
boards, and the young chiefs entered. As soon as they had come in, 
Xu'ga'msala spoke: "These are tbe cormorants of Ts'a'watc. That is 
the only place where they eat nothing but oulachon. Therefore they are 
fat.' Now beat the boards, friends." The old men beat the boards, 
and, the women came in, spreading their blankets. They had red cedar 
bark ornaments on their heads, the same as the men. Then Xu'gamsila 
spoke: "They are the sawbill ducks; they dive for property." Now 
Ta'mXuak'as spoke: "Friends, what do you think? Shall we discard 
the use of the red cedar bark which makes us happy"? We shall only 
be downhearted if we should discard it. We shall be asleep all the time. 
Now, friends, we will finish this night. We will have the last dance of 
this season. You, Ta'xalats'e, shall change our names this night. That 
is what I say, P'alxalasqEm. 

Now Hd'LElite arose and spoke: "This is your speech, Ta'mXuak-as. 
You said we would finish this night. Did you hear the speech of our 
friend La'mg-ala ? He says they will take off' the red cedar bark. I 
will not take it ott". That is what I say, KuLE'm ; that is what I say, 
Ts'a'lgaxsta. I must accept the words of all our friends.'" 

Then arose Yu'x-yukwamas, chief of the Nimkish : " These are your 
speeches, friends. You wish to throw away the red cedar bark. Now 
answer my speech, Ta'mXuak-as." 

Then the latter answered: "It is true. I said so because our friends 
here do not treat in the right way the cedar bark of which we are afraid, 
which we inherited from our grandfathers. It is our master, it makes 
our life short. It is true I said we would finish to-night." 

Then Yu'x*yukwamas spoke again: "Did you hear, friends! Did 
you hear it, La'qoasqEm? Let them finish now. You finish to-night. 
But I am waiting for the repayment of the marriage money to my 
friends. Therefore I do not want to take oft' the cedar bark to-night. 
You may change your names to-night, wa, wa. I say this, Nu'xnemis; 
Isay this, Ho'LElite; I say this, La'mg-ala; wa. It is a great thing that

we are talkiu- about, my tribe." Then Nu'-xnOmis arose aud spoke: 
"That is your speecli, Ta'inXualv-as; we are all afraid of your speech, 
oreat tribe ! It is better that you finish to-ni j>ht. Keep on in the old 
ways of our grandfathers! I thank you, great tribe, keep on in this 
way my children ! Do not abuse what we inherited from our grand- 
fathers Your words are true. This cedar bark will make life short 
if it is not used in the right way. Now take care, friends ! I say this, 
Kwakiutl, Ma'malcleqala, J^imkish, Ts'a'mas." Tlien all the chiefs said 

" wa wa." 

Now TVmXuak-as arose again and spoke: "Thank you, friends, for 
your words. Now I will take off the red cedar bark to-night. Oome, 
friends, and vou women, and let us dance. Let the tribes listen to us 
and watch our customs." Then the men aud the women assembled and 
sang the old song. Xti'gamsila carried a long notched pole about 7 
feet long. This is his song : 

1 Now dance! take off bv means of your dance tlic great bead ornament, tbe bead 

ornnn.ent tbat you inberited from tbe mask of tbe winter ceremonial worn by 
tbe first of our tribe. Wo, o, 6, o, o, buwaia, buwaia, wo, o, o, 6, o. (Here 
all tbo people lifted tbeir cedar bark ornaments.)

With this they lifted the ornaments again and put them in the notch 
of the staff which Xn'gamsila was carrying. The song is the same as 
the one which rja'mtalaL used when taking off his cedar bark orna- 
ments. As soon as they had finished their song, they changed their 
names. Now he whose name had been Xu'gamsila was called Ha'mts'it. 
Then NEg-e', whose name had been Pa'xalats'e, spoke: "My tribe, 
now let some one rise who wants to take these red cedar bark orna- 
ments for next winter." 

Then Ya/qoLas arose and spoke: "1 come, NEg-c', in answer to your 
s])eech. I will take this red cedar bark." Then he spread his blanket, 
the cedar bark ornaments were thrown into it, and he hid them in his 
l)edroom. Then all the members of the T'Ena'xtax tribe tied handker- 
chiefs around their heads. They had finished their winter dance, 
Walas NEg-e' distributed blaukets. They did not give first to the 
ha'mats'a, but to the head cliief. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. ()21 



XII. The eao'laxa. 



I pointed out at ;i ibnner place tbat the La'Lasiqoala group the dances 
in two classes — tbe ts'e'ts'aeqa aud the nn'iiLEm. The no'iiLEm 
dances are closely connected with the clans, and during- their perform- 
ance the ordinary social system remains in full force. The Kwakiutl 
have only a few of these dances which they call Lao'laxn, which name 
is also sometimes used by the La'Lasiqoala. It is difficult to establish 
any fundamental difference between a Lao'laxa dance and a ts'e'ts'aeqa 
dance, as in both cases a hereditary genius initiates the novice, and 
as in both ceremonials membership is obtained in the same manner — 
through marriage, or by killing a person who is entitled to the cere- 
monial. The distinction is comparatively clear among the La'Lasiqoala 
and the affiliated tribes. Only those dances which derive their origin 
from BaxbakualanuXsI'wae and his following, or from Wlna'lag-ilis, 
are ts'e'ts'aeqa; all others are no'nLEm. To this class belong all the 
-animals, and we find that they are much more clearly clan deities than 
the former class. At the same time it is stated distinctly that the whole 
ceremonial was introduced through intermarriage with the northern 
tribes, particularly the Ile'iltsuq. This consciousness of an entirely 
foreign origin of all the Lao'laxa dances is still stronger among the 
Kwakiutl, while many danc-es which undoubtedly had the same origin 
have been incorporated by them in the ts'e'ts'aCMja. 

The La'Lasi(|oala use in the no'nLEm ceremonial cormorant down 
in place of eagle down, white cedar bark in place of red cedar bark, 
red paint in place of black paint. They sing both profane songs 
aud ts'e'ts'aeqa songs. The celebration takes place in November and 
December. 

Among the Kwakiutl the Lao'laxa may be celebrated at any time of 
the year. The man who desires to give the festival calls his clan or 
tribe to his house and informs them of his plans. T am obliged to ]Mr. 
George Hunt for the following descri[)tion of such a meeting: 

Ots'estalis, a man whose mother Avas a Ile'iltsuq, was about to give a 
Lao'laxa. He invited his clan and SDoke as follows: 

''Now come, my tribe, come Ila'mts'it, come Ye'qawite, come G-e'so- 
yag-ilis, come Lfi/qoag'ila, come Tso'palis; come to hear the words of our 
chief. Gome Guc'tEla, come Q'd'moyue, Walas Kwakiutl, Q'o'mk-utis. 
Thank you, my tribe, for coming. I must tell you about my plans. I 
will show the dance Avliich came down from heaven, the Lao'laxa, the 
coming niglit. Take care, my tribe, take care all of you, you second 
class chiefs. I do not mean you, Ghief Ila'mts'it. I mean Ma'Xua 
and Wa'nuk" and O'ts'estalis and Ma'mXua and L I'lak-uts'a and you 
third class young chiefs. Xow take care, the supernatural power will 
come to dwell among the tribes that are assembled at our camp, great 
Kwakiutl! Xow 1 will tell you what I carry in my hands. I will give 
away my copper Wa'numg-ila to the Xa'q'oaqtoq, Koskimo, G'o'p'enox,

aud L'a'sq'enox. Its price is 800 blankets. I think tbat will be enough 
for these eight tribes here, and my other copper Ma'mukoahla shall all 
on the Ma'maleleqala, Qoe'xsot'enox, and Nimkish, and the Lau itsis 
and Matilpe and T'Ena'xtax and A'waiLala and Ts'a'watErMM.x and 
Ha'xuauns. I think that is enongh! Ma'inukoahla's price is G 000 
blankets. This will be enongh for the nine tribes, and I will sell lor 
food my copper Mau'aga, for which I paid 2,400 blankets at the tinie 
when Lalak-uts'a wanted to sell it quickly at Me'mk-umbs. Else the 
tribe might say that they are starving in this great country. Liit this 
way they can tind no fault when they come.^' Sometimes ore or the 
other of the old men said "yes, yes," during his speech, and he con- 
tinued- -Furthermore, such is my pride, that I will kill on this hre 
this my copper, Dandalayfi, which is groaning in my house \ou all 
know how much I paid for it. I bought it for 4,000 blankets, ^ow I 
will break it in order to vau.piish our rival. I will make my house a 
hohting place for you, my tribe, wa. Now you know it all, my tribe; 
be happy, chiefs ! for this is the first time that so great an invitation has. 
been issued. There are 9,200 blankets, besides the 4,000 blankets for 
the copper that I am going to break. Now count all that the mvitation 
will cost It is 13,200 blankets, and besides 250 button blankets, 270 
silver bracelets, and 7,000 brass bracelets, 240 wash basins, and I do 
not count the spoons, abalono shells, and the LaO'laxa head mask, and 
the numerous kettles which I am expecting from my wife. Now you 
know all my plans!" 

Then Wa'k-as arose and spoke : " Wa, my tribe ! Did you hear what 
our chief counted up? Are you not atraid of the various kinds of 
property which he is expecting? Now long life to you, O'tsestahs 
you who were made a chief by your fathers. Take care of our chiet 
my tribe. Take care, Gue'tEla, Q'«Vinoyue, Walas Kwakiutl, and 
Q'o'mk-utis. He is vomiting everything that he has in his mmd. My 
tribe, are yoii not also glad of our chief? I think you are proud in 
your hearts. Thank you, O'ts'estalis. Thank you from my heart, chiel. 
I wish you long life. You will be the first of all the chiefs of all 
tribes. ^So I say, Ts'o'palis, thus 1 say, HJi'masaqa, G-esoyag-ilis, 
Ma'koayalisame, Da'dants'it, Lfi'lakaux-it, wa, wa. So we say, our 

whole tribe." , . v +i f 

Then arose Ma'mXua: "That is your speech, Chief O'ts'estalis; tliat 
is your speech, Wa'k-as. Thank you, chief. How pretty is my chief ! 
Thank you, friend. Now my heart is alive, for I was afraid when I 
heard the news of our rival. Ho, ho, ho. Now I lift the heavy weight 
of your speech, chief. Thank you, brother. So I say for my whole 
tribe." Then O'mx'it arose and said: "Thank you for your speech, 
O'ts'cstalis. Long life to you for your speech. How well you stand on 
our earth. You will be the only post of our world. The chiefs of all 
the tribes will be jealous of you, you overhanging mountain, you chief 
who can not be ecpialed. You do not need to fear anything. How

great is your name, chief. Now you made my back strong. Take 
care, luy tribe, and wish long life to our chiefs." l^]verybody applauded 
his speech. Then O'lnx-'it sat down. 

Next Hfi'mEsk-inis arose and spoke. He said : " My tribe, are you 
not ashamed of this young manf He will be your chief, Kwakiutll I 
am half ashamed myself on account of the amounts counted. Go on, 
my son, be proud of what you said." Then he lifted his right hand 
and shouted : ''Hide yourselves, tribes ! never was seen such an amount 
of property as our chief has called. Ya, ya, my tribe, do you not con 
sider the great mountain of property of O'ts'estalis dreadful? He is 
still a young man. Take care, my children, that you may have two 
men who will give away blankets to the whole world. That is what J 
say to the chiefs of the Kwakiutl, wa, wa."

Now it was growing dark, and O'ts'estalis arose and spoke: "Loolc 
at me, my tribe! Pretty is this young man; he is growing up well. 
Now I will sing the secret song and try to call the spirit of my dance." 

The people said: "Go on." And he sung his secret song, calling- 
down the spirit of the Lao'laxa: 

1. I am the greatest magician, O liihihi, i, the greatest magician. 

2. I alone am full of magic, O hihihi, i, the greatest magic. 

3. I am the only one who makes life short by means of his magic, the greatest magic. 

4. I am the only one who knows to call down the magical power, the greatest magic. 
Come now, magical i)ower, O hihihi, i, greatest magic. 

As soon as he had finished his song the noise of whistles came down 
to the roof of the house. Then they called all the women and cliildi-en. 
They came to the dancing house for the Lao'laxa. O'ts'estalis arose. Ke

was glad that the people liad come quickly, and said: " Yes, my tribe, 
you have done right that you have come to this large house. Make 
yourselves comfortable. Don't be in a hurry to go home to your 
houses. Thus 1 say, Wa'k-as. Thus I say, Om'x-'it, wa, wa." Then 
the songmakers sang, and the people sat around them learning the 
songs of the dancer. When all knew the song, O'ts'estalis arose and 
sang: 

Ya, I am the first, liei, ya, lia. 

Ya, my speech is the highest, hei, ya, ha. 

He stopped singing and said: " Ho, ho, ho! Yes, my tribe. Thus I 
lift the heavy weight of my wealth. Now we will call all the tribes 
that they may come in the morning. Now go to sleep. That is all, 
friends." Then all the people, men, women, and children, left the house. 
The following morning the Kwakiutl went out in their canoes to invite 
all the tribes.

As this festival was to be given to a number of tribes, all the Kwa- 
kiutl took part in this meeting. When only the Kwakiutl are to be 
present, the host announces his intention to his clan alone. Then, after 
the meeting is over, he sends word to the chiefs of all the clans, advising 
them that the Lao'laxa whistles will be heard that night. Then all 
those who have celebrated a T.ao'laxa before may go to ask him what 
masks he intends to show, m order to make sure that he will not 
infringe upon their rights. In the evening the whistles are heard to 
blow behind the house of the man who is going to give the Lao'laxa. 
After about ten minutes they sto]>, and then blow again. This is 
repeated four times. For four nights the whistles are heard in the 
woods behind the house. The fourth night, after they have been 
blown in the woods three times, they are heard on the roof, and tinally 
in the b(Hlrooni. Then the man begins to siim' his secret song.

blankets among these young men. This signifies a promise to dis- 
tribute food to all the people. 

The young men put on the blankets and go from house to house 
saying: ''This is food which you will receive to-morrow. It belongs 

to .^ " They go back to the host's house and return the 

blankets to him. On the following morning all the young men assem- 
ble again. They are given red paint to adorn their faces, and they 
are sent to call the peoi)le to the promised feast. Only the men are 
invited. After two calls all assemble and arrange in groups according 
to their clans. As soon as all have assembled, the messengers join 
their clans. Before the feast begins, four songs are sung, as is cus- 
tomary, two by the Cxue'tEla and two by the Q'o'moyue. Then the 
host fills a ladle with grease and sends it to Hawaxalag-ilis, who is 
the highest in rank, and to the others in order. During all this time 
the Lao'laxa whistles are heard to blow in the 
bedroom. When the grease has been eaten, the 
relative of the host who is to be initiated comes out 
of the bedroom in which the whistles are sounding 
and begins to dance around the fire. He wears a 
beautiful carved headdress with long ermine trail 
(Plate 47). All of a sudden he throws his mask off 
and runs out. After a short while a dancer wear- 
ing the Lao'laxa mask comes in. His arrival is 
announced by a relative of the host who is stationed

mask. After one circuit of the fire the mask disappears again, and the 
novice, for so we may call him, comes forward and continues the dance 
which was interrupted before. The people accompany the dance by the 
Lao'laxa song. After he has finished, a few women dance in honor of 
the new Lao'laxa. The host joins them, carrying a pole about G feet 
long on his shoulder. The pole indicates that on the next day he will 
give another feast, to which lie invites the people, after ending his dance. 

In the evening the whole tribe, men, women, and children, assemble 
in the host's house to witness the dance, and the performance of the 
morning is then repeated. 

On the following morning the messengers go out again, dressed up 
and having their faces painted red, to call the people to the second feast. 
The ceremony of the preceding day is repeated, but another Ladlaxa 
dance may be shown. This is repeated again in the evening, when the

speech gives the dancer the name belonging- to the mash. This is the 
end ot the LacVlaxa proper, and the whistles are heard no longer. At 
some festivals a number of masked persons, who represent speakers,

what thoy want, they praise liis liberality, saying- that he made all the 
tribes fat by the amount of grease he had given. Finally they are 
taken out of the house. Then the blankets are placed on top of a 
drum, which is laid down on its side. The man whose office it is to dis- 
tribute blankets in thepotlatch (da'qEmayaenox = taking the blanket 
at its top edge), of whom there is one in each clan, sits on top of the 
drum. His office is hereditary in the male line and considered as very 
important. He calls the people's names, and throws the blankets upon 
a mat lying in front of the drum. A man standing next to liim carries 
the blankets to those who are to receive them. As soon as the blankets 
intended for one clan are distributed, he calls, " Let us change!'' 
This is the end of the Lao'laxa.

The rattles used by the Lao'laxa dancer differ from those used in the 
winter ceremonial. While most of the latter are round (figs. 51-00, pp. 
435-440), the lormcr have the shape of birds which carry a number of 
figures on their backs (figs. 190, 101, pp. 023, 024). T^Fost of these rattles 
represent the raven with upturned tail. The face of a hawk is carved 
on the i)elly of the raven. A reclining figure is placed on its back. 
The knees of this figure are raised and grasped by the hands. A 
bird's head is represented on the tail of the raven. These rattles are 
undoubtedly conies of similar ones that are used by the Haida and

Tsimshian. The primary idea underlying the form of rattle seems to 
have been lost, since the only explanation that has ever been given by 
the northern Indians is to the effect that it was given to their ancestors 
by a supernatural being. The Kwakiutl state that they obtained these 
rattles, with the Lao'laxa ceremonies, from the He'iltsuq.

she wears a hirge basket on her back, in which she carries cop])ers. 
These are given to the host, who gives them away. In the legend, she 
carries a basket into which she puts children, whom she takes to her 
house. 

As stated before, a number of the songs given in Chapter VIII, so 
far as they belong to the La'Lasiqoala, must be counted in this group. 

In another dance the sun mask (fig. 197, ]). 030) is used. The outer 
mask represents the cloudy sky, while the inner mask represents the 
clear sunshine. 

XIII. The Keligious Ceremonialsi of other Tribes of the 
^ORTH Pacific; Coast. 

THE NOOTKA. 

The Xootka speak a dialect distantly related to the Kwakiutl. They 
have two ceremonials, which are analogous to the winter ceremonial of 
the Kwakiutl. Good descriptions of the customs connected with these 
ceremonials have beeu given by Sproat, Swan, Jew^tt, and Kni])ping. 
I will repeat here what I have said on this subject in another phice,' 
The name of the ceremonial among the Nootkais Lo'koala, a Kwakiutl 
word, which designates the finding of a manitou. The ceremonial cor- 
responds very nearly to the Walas'axa' and to the Lo'koala of the 
Kwakiutl (pp. 477, 478). Certain features are, however, embodied in it, 
which correspond to other dances, mainly to the ma/tEm and the ha/- 
mats'a. The Lo'koala are a secret society who celebrate their festivals 
in winter only. They have a chief whose name is Yaqsyaqste'itq. 
Anyone who wishes to join the Lo'koala can do so, or the society may 
invite a man to become a member. Tlien the friends of this man make 
a collection in his behalf and turn over the property collected to the 
chief of the Lo'koala, who distributes it during a feast among the mem- 
bers. Those who are not Lo'koala are called wicta'k-u, i. e., not being 
shamans. The Lo'koala is believed to have been instituted by the 
wolves, the tradition being that a chief's son was taken away by 
the wolves, who tried to kill him, but, being unsuccessful in their 
attempts, became his friends and taught him the Lo'koala. They 
ordered him to teach his people the ceremonies on his return home. 
They carried the youth back to his village. They also asked him to 
leave some red cedar bark for their own Lo'koala behind, whenever 
he moved from one place to another; a custom to which the Nootka 
tribes still adhere. Every new member of the Lo'koala must be ini- 
tiated by the wolves. At night a pack of wolves — that is, Indians 
dressed in wolf skins and wearing wolf masks — make their appear- 
ance, seize the novice, and carry him into the woods. When the wolves 
are heard outside the village coming, in order to fetch the novice, 

' Report of tho British Associatiou for the Advauceineut of Science, 1890, i)age 47. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 633 

tlie members of the Lo'koala blacken their faces and sing the follow- 
ing song: ' 

Among all the tribes is great excitement because I am Lo'koala. 

On the following- day the wolves return the novice dead. Then the 
Lo'koala must revive him. The wolves are supposed to have put 
the magic stone haina- into his body, which must be removed in order 
to restore liim to life. The body is left outside the house and two 
siiamans go to remove tlie liiiina. It seems that this stone is quartz. 
The idea is the same as that found among the Kwakiutl, where the 
Ma'tEm is initiated by means of quartz, which is put into his body by 
the spirit of his dance. The returning novice is called u'cTnak. 

After the novices have been restored to life, they are painted red 
and black. Blood is seen to stream from their mouths, and they run 
at once down to the beach and jump into the water. Soon they are 
found to drift lifeless on the water. A canoe is sent out and the bod- 
ies are gathered in it. As soon as the canoe lands, they all return 
to life, resort to the dancing house, to which none but the initiated 
are admitted, and stay there for four days. At night, dances are per- 
formed in the house, which the whole population is allowed to witness. 
After the four days are over, the novices leave the house, their lieads 
being wound with wreaths of hemlock ( ?) branches. They go to the 
river, in which they swim, and after some time are fetched back by 
a canoe. They are almost exhausted from tlie exertions they have 
undergone during the foregoing days. Novices must eat nothing but 
dried fish and dried berries. 

Each Lo'koala lasts four days. It is only celebrated when some 
member of the tribe gives away a large amount of proj^erty to the 
Lo'koala, the most frequently occurring occasion being the initiation of 
new members. Sometimes it is celebrated at the time of the ceremo- 
nies which are practiced when a girl reaches maturity. The house of 
the iiian who pays for the Lo'koala seems to be the taboo house of the 
society. As soon as the Lo'koala begins, the ordinary social organiza- 
tion of the tribe is suspended, as is also the case among the Kwakiutl. 
The people arrange themselves in companies or societies, which bear 
the names of the various i>footka tribes, no matter to which tribe and 
sept the persons actually belong. Each society has festi\'als of its own, 
to which members of the other societies are not admitted, although 
they may be invited. These societies are called ii'paL. Each has a 
certain song, which is sung during their festivities.^ 

At night, when the whole tribe assemble in the taboo House, the 
societies still keep together. They are hostile to each other, and 
railleries between the various groui)S are continually going on. It

634 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

seems that there are no separate societies for men and Avomen, but a 
certain division must exist, as they seem to have separate feasts. When 
a man, during a Lo'koala, brings in any game, and he does not give half 
of it to the women, but retains the whole for the use of the men, the 
former will attack him and wrest the share due to them from the men. 
In the same way the women must share all they get or cook with the men. 

Originally each dance belonged to one family, and was transmitted 
from generation to generation. Mother as well as father had the right 
to transfer their dances to their children. Thus dances which belonged 
to one tribe were transmitted to others. The dance was given to the 
novice at the time of his or her initiation, and no more than one dance 
could be given at a time. At present these restrictions are becoming 
extinct. Whoever is rich enough to distribute a sufficient amount of 
property may take any dance he likes. I was eveu told that the chief 
of the Lo'koala at the beginning of the dancing season distributes the 
various dances among the members of the order, and that he may 
redistribute them at the beginning of the following season. 

It is a peculiarity of the dances of the Nootka that two masks of the 
same kind always dance together. 

Among the dances belonging to the Lo'koala I mention the aai'Lqe 
(feathers on head). He is supposed to be a being living in the woods. 
The dancer wears no mask, but a head ornament of cedar bark dyed 
led, which is the badge of the Lo'koala. His badge consists of a ring 
from which four feathers wound with red cedar bark rise, three over 
the forehead, one in the back. The face of the dancer is smeared with 
tallow and then strewn with down. The ornaments of each dancer of 
the aai'Lqe, as well as of all others, must bo their personal property. 
They must not be loaned or borrowed. The song of the aai'Lqe will 
be found in the Appendix (p. 732). 

Another dance is that of the hi'nEmix*, a fabulous bird-like being. 
The dancer wears the head mask shown iu Plate -18. In the top of the 
mask there is a hole in which a stick is fastened, whicn is greased and 
covered with down. When the dancer moves, the down becomes loose, 
and whoever among the si^ectators catches a feather receives a blanket 
from the chief of the Lo'koala. The song of the hi'iiEmix* is given in 
the Appendix (p. 732). 

The A'Lmaxko is a dance in which two men wearing two human 
masks appear. The masks are called A'Lmaxko. When they appear, the 
spectators sing: 

J J 1 J J I .^ J il 

Kwai - as kwai - as A'L-max-k5 



/. e., Back out, back out, A'Lmaxko. 

Then they leave the house and run about in the viilage. The 
A'Lmaxko is a being living in the woods. The tirst to see him was a 
Netcumu'asath, and ever since this sept dances the A'Lmaxko dance.

The sa'nEk (panther) corresponds nearly to the niiLmaL of the 
Kwakintl. The dancer wears a large h'ead mask, like that of the hi'nE- 
mix-, and a bearskin. He knocks every thin o- to pieces, pours water 
into the fire, and tears dogs to pieces and devours them. Two canine 
teeth in the mouth of the mask are its most characteristic feature. A 
rope is tied around his waist, by which he is led by some attendants. 

The hI'Ltaq, self torture, corresponds to the hawT'ualaL of the Kwa- 
kintl. The dancers rub their bodies Avith the juice of certain herbs, and 
push small lauces through the tlesh of the arms, the back, and the flanks. 

Other dances are the pu'kmis dance, in which the dancer is cov- 
ered all over with i)ipeciay; the hu'Luiis dance — the hu'Lmis is 
another being which 
lives in the woods and 
is always dancing — 
performed by women 
only, who wear orna- 
ments of red cedar 
bark and buds' down 
and who dance with 
one hand extended 
upward, the other 
hanging downward; 
the ri'yeq dance, in 
which the dancer 
knocks to pieces and 
destroys in other 
ways household 
utensils, canoes, and other kinds of property; and dances represent- 
ing a great variety of animals, particularly birds. The masks are all 
much alike in type (fig. 108). Head rings made of red cedar bark are 
worn ill these dances. 

Plate 49 shows an old bird uuxsk and an old mask representing a 
human face. They are iVom the west coast of Vancouver Island, and 
were probably made before tlie beginning of this century. Plate 50 
represents the type of rattle used by the Nootka. The present specimen 
was probably collected on Cook's journey around the world. 

The tribes north of Barclay Sound have a dance in which the per- 
former cuts long parallel gashes into his breast and arms. The 
ha/mats'a dance, which has been obtained by intermarriage from the 
Kwakiutl, has spread as far south as Xutca'lath. The killing of 
slaves, whicli has been described by Sproat' and Knippiiig, may belong 
to this part of the Lo'koala. 

Sproat describes the following events: 

lu December, 1864, the Sesliaht ludians, then occupying tlieir village close to 
Alberni, put one of their women to a violent death. The day before they commenced

a celebratiou of a peculiar character, which Avas to last several days, and the 
mnrder of the woman fonued, no doubt, a part of this celebration. The woman 
was stabbed to death hy an old man in whose house she lived, and who probably 
owned her as a slave, and offered her for a victim. The body Avas then laid out, 
without a covering, by the water side, about 150 yards from the houses. There 
appeared to be no inclination to bury the body, and it was only after the chief had 
been strongly remonstrated with that the poor victim's remains were removed, after 
two days' exposure. I observed that, even after this removal, certain furious rites 
took place over the very spot where the body had been exposed. The chief feature 
of the celebration, apart from the inurder, was a pretended attack upon the Indiun 
settlement by wolves, which were represented by Indians, Avhile the rest of the 
population, painted, armed, and with furious shouts, defended their houses from 
attack. The horrid practice of sacrificing a victim is not annual, but only occurs 
either once in three years, or else (which is more probable) at uncertain intervals; 
alwnys, however, when it does happen, the sacrifice takes place during the Klooh- 
quahn-nah (Ld'koala) season, which lasts from about the middle of November to 
the middle of .January. The Klooh-quahn-uah or Klooh-quel-lah is a great festival, 
observed annually by all the Aht tribes, after their return from their fishing grounds 
to the winter encampment. It is generally a time of mirth and feasting, during 
which tribal rank is conferred and homage done to the chief, in a multitude of 
observances which have now lost their meaning, and can not be explained by the 
natives themselves. I was not aware, until this murder Avas committed under our 
eyes, that human sacrifices formed any part of the Klooh-(|nahn-nah celebration. 
I should think it likely that old worn-out slaves are generally the victims. The 
Seshaht Indians at Alberui represent the practice as most ancient, and the fact that 
the other tribes of the Aht nation (about twenty in number) observe it, faA^ors this 
supposition. Their legends somewhat differ as to this i)ractice, some saying that it 
was instituted by the creator of the world; others that it arose from the sons of a 
chief of former times haA'ing really been seized by wolA'es.' To some extent it is a 
secret institution, the young children not being acquainted with it until formally 
initiated. Many of them during the horrid rite are much alarmed; the exhibition 
of ferocity, the firing of guns and shouting being calculated, and probably intended, 
to excite their fears. Part of a day is given np to an instruction of those children 
who are to be initiated, and it is impressed upon them that the Klooh-quahn-nah 
must always be kept up, or evil will happen to the tribe. The tendency, no doubt, 
and probably the intention of this human sacrifice, and the whole celebration, is to 
destroy the natural human feeling against murder, and to form in the people gener- 
ally, and especially in the rising generation, hardened and fierce hearts. They them- 
selves say that their "hearts are bad," as long as it goes on. In the attendant cere- 
monies their children are taught to look, Avithout any sign of feeling, upon savage 
preparations for war, strange dances performed in hideous masks and accompanied 
by unearthly noises, and occasionally, at least, upon the cruel destruction of human 
life. Although I have no direct evidence of the fact, I believe that part of the 
course of those to be initiated Avould be to vicAV, howl over, and perhaps handle or 
even stick their knives into the dead body of the Anctim, Avithout showing any sign 
of pity or of horror. 



'These Indians imitate animals and birds extremely well, such as wolves or 
crows. At this Klooh-quahn-nah celebration they had their hair tied out from their 
heads, so as to represent a Avolf's head and snout, and the blanket was arranged 
to shoAv a tail. The motion of the wolf in running was closely imitated. More ex- 
traordinary still Avas their acting as crows; they had a la'go Avooden bill, and 
blankets arranged so like Avings that, in the dusk, the Indians really seemed like 
large crows hopping about, particularly Avheu, after the manner of these birds, 
they Avent into the shallow Avater, and shook their wings and "dabbed" with their 
long bills. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 637 

The followiug description may also refer to part of this ceremonial:^ 

During the song aucl dance, which at first seemed to present nothing peculiar, a 
well-known slave (one, however, who was in a comparatively independent position, 
being employed as a sailor on board the steamer Thames), suddenly ceased dancing, 
and fell down on the ground, apparently in a. dying state, and having his face covered 
with blood. He did not move or speak, his head tell on one side, his limbs were 
drawn up, and he certainly presented a ghastly spectacle. While the dance raged 
furiously around the fallen man, the doctor, with some others, seized and drao'ged 
him to the other side of the fire round which they were dancing, placing his naked 
feet very near the fiames. After this a pail of water was brought in, and tlie 
doctor, Avho supported the dying man on his arm, washed the blood from his face; 
the people beat drums, danced, and sang, and suddenly the patient sprang to his 
feet and joined in the dance, none the worse for the apparently hopeless condition 
of the moment before. While all this was going on, I asked the giver of the feast 
whether it was real blood upon the man's face, and if he were really wounded. He 
told me so seriously that it was, that I was at first inclined to believe him, until he 
began to explain that the blood which came from the nose and mouth was owing to 
the incantations of the medicine man, and that all the ])eopl6 v/ould be very angry 
if he did not afterwards restore him. I then recalled to mind that in the early 
part of the day, before the feast, I had seen the doctor and the slave holding very 
friendly conferences ; and the former had used his influence to get a pass for the 
latter to be present at the eutertainnieut, to which, probably, he had no right to 
come. 

In Jewett's narrative- the following description of part of the Lo'ko- 
ala occurs : 

On the morning of December 13, another strange ceremony began, by the king's 
firing a pistol, apparently, without a moment's warning, close to the ear of Satsat 
who dropped down instantly as if shot dead on the spot. 

Upon this all the women set up a most terrible yelling, tearing out their hair 
by handfuls, and crying out that the prince was dead, when the men rushed in, 
anued with guns and daggers, inquiring into the cause of the alarm, followed by 
two of the natives covered with wolfskins, with masks representing the wolf's head. 

These two came in on all fours, and taking up the prince on their back, carried 
him out, retiring as they had entered. * * * 

The celebration terminated with a shocking and distressing show of deliberate 
self-torment. 

These men, each with two bayonets run through their sides, between the ribs, 
walked up and down in the room, singing war songs, and exulting in their firmness 
and triumi^h over pain (p. 187). * * # 

The religious ceremonies (in another village) were concluded by 20 men who 
entered the house, with arrows run through their sides and arms, having strings 
fastened to them, by which the spectators twisted, or jiulled them back, as the meu 
walked round the room, singing and boasting of their power to endure suftering 
(p. 192). 

Another description of the ceremonial has been given by James G. 
Swan:^ 

The Dukwally (i. e., lO'koala) and other tama'nawas performances are exhibitions 
intended to represent incidents connected with their mythological legends. There

.ire a great variety, and they seem to take the place, iu a measure, of theatrical 
performances or games during the season of the religions festivals. There are no 
persons especially set .apart as priests for the performance of these ceremonies, 
although some, who seem more expert than others, are usually hired to give life to 
the scenes, hut these performers are quite as often found among the slaves or com- 
mon i>eopl(' as among the chiefs, and excepting during the continuance of the festiv- 
ities are not looked on as of any particular importance. On iminiriug the origin of 
Ihese ceremonies, I was informed that they did not originate with the Indians, hut 
were revelations of the guardian spirits, who m.ade known what they wished to he 
performed. An Indian, for inst.ance, who has been consulting with his gnardian 
spirit, which is done hy going through the washing and fasting process before 
described, will imagine or think he is called upon to represent the owl. He arranges 
in his mind the style of dress, the number of performers, the songs and dances or other 
movements, and, h.aving the plan perfected, announces at a tama'nawas meeting that 
he has had a revelation which he will impait to a select few. These are then taught 
and drilled in strict secrecy, and when they have perfected themselves, will sud- 
denly m.ake their appearance and perform before the astonished tribe. Another 
Indian gets up the representation of the whale, others do the s.ame of birds, and iu 
fact of everything that they can think of. If any performance is a success, it is 
repeated, and gradually comes to be looked upon as one of the regular order iu the 
ceremonies; if it does not satisfy the audience, it is Laid aside. Thus they have per- 
formances that have been handed down from remote ages, while others are of a more 
recent date. * " 

The ceremony of the great Dukwall^' or the thunder bird originated with the 
Hcsh-kwi-et Indians, a band of Nittinats living near Barclay Sound, Vancouver 
Island, and is ascribed to the following legend: 

Two men had fallen in love with one woman, and as she would give neither the 
preference, at last they came to .a quarrel. But one of them, who had better sense 
than the other, s.aid: "Don't let Tis fight about that squaw; I will go out aud see 
the chief of the wolves, and he will tell me what is to be done. But I can not 
get to his lodge except by stratagem. Now they know we are at variance, so do you 
take me by the hair, and drag me over these sharp rocks which are covered with 
harn.acles, and I shall bleed, and I will pretend to be dead, and the wolves will come 
and carry me away to their house." The other agreed, and dragged him over the 
rocks till he was lacerated from head to foot, and then left him out of reach of the 
tide. The wolves came, .and, supposing him dead, carried him to the lodge of their 
chief, bnt when they got ready to eat him, he jumped up and astonished them at his 
boldness. The chief wolf was so much pleased with his bravery that he imparted to 
him all the mysteries of the thunder-bird performance, and on his return home he 
instructeil his friends, and the Dukwally was the result. The laceration of the arms 
and legs among the Makahs, during the performance to be described, is to represent 
the laceration of the founder of the ceremony from being dragged over the sharp 
stones. 

A person intending to give one of these performances first gathers together as 
much property as he can obtain, in blankets, guns, brass kettles, beads, tin pans, 
and other articles intended as presents for his guests, and procnres a sufficient quan- 
tity of food, which of late years consists of flour, biscuit, rice, potatoes, molasses, 
dried fish, and roots. He keeps his intention a secret until he is ue.arlj' ready, and 
then imparts it to a few of his friends, who, if need he, assist him by adding to his 
stock of presents of food. The first intimation the village has of the intended 
ceremonies is on the night previous to the first day's performance. After the com- 
munity have retired for the night, which is usuiilly between 9 aud 10 o'clock, the 
])erformer8 commence by hooting like owls, howling like wolves, and uttering a 
sh.arp whistling sound intended to represent the blowing .and whistling of the wind. 
Guns are then fired, aiul all the initiated collect in the lodge where the ceremonies 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 639 

are to be performed, and drimi with their heels on boxes or boards, producing a 
sound resembling thunder. The torches of pitch wood are flashed through the roof 
of the bouse, and at each flash the thunder rolls, and then the whole assemblage 
whistles like the wind. As soon as the noise of the performers commences, the 
uninitiated fly in terror and hide themselves, so great being their superstitious 
belief in the supernatural powers of the Dukwally that they have frequently fled to 
my house for protection, knowing very well that the tama'nawas performers would 
not come near a white man. They then visit every house in the village, and extend 
an invitation for all to attend the ceremonies. This having been done, the crowd 
retire to the lodge of ceremonies, where the drumming and singing are kept up till 
near daylight, when they are quiet for a short time, and at sunrise begin again. 
The first five days are usually devoted to secret ceremonies, such as initiating can- 
didates, and a variety of performances, which consist chiefly in songs and chorus 
and drumming to imitate thuiuler. They do this part very well, and their imitation 
of thunder is quite equal to that produced in the best equipped tlieatre. 

What the ceremony of initiation is I have never learned. That of the Clallams, 
which I have witnessed, consists in putting the initiates into a mesmeric sleep ; but if 
the Makahs use mesmerism, or any such influence, they do not keep the candidates 
under it for any great length of time, as I saw them every day during the cere- 
monies, Avalking out during the intervals. The first outdoor performance usually 
commences on the fifth day, and this consists of the procession of males and females, 
with their legs and arms, and sometimes their bodies, scarified with knives, and 
every wound bleeding freely. The men are entirely naked, but the women have 
on a short petticoat. * * * [The wounds are made as follows:] A bucket of 
water was placed in the center of the lodge, and the candidates squatting around it 
washed their arms and legs. Tlie persons who did the cutting, and who appeared 
to be any one who had sharp knives, butcher knives being preferred, grasped them 
firmly in the right hand with the thumb placed along the blade, so as to leave but 
an eighth or quarter of an inch of the edge bare; then, taking hold of the arm or 
leg of the candidate, made gashes 5 or 6 inches long transversally, and parallel with 
the limb, four or five gashes being cut each way. Cuts were thus made on each 
arm above and below the elbow, on each thigh, and the calves of the legs; some, 
but not all, were likewise cut on their backs. The wounds Avere (hen washed with 
water to make the blood run freely. >^ * * When all was ready, the procession 
left the lodge and marched in single file down to the beach, their naked bodies 
streaming with blood, presenting a barbarous spectacle. A circle was formed at the 
water's edge, round which this bloody procession marched slowlj', making gesticula- 
tions and uttering howling cries. 

Five men now came out of the lodge carrying the principal performer. ( Jne held 
him by the hair, and the others by the arms and legs. He, too, was cut and bleeding 
profusely. They laid him down on the beach on the wet sand, and left him, while 
they marched ott" and visited every lodge in tlie village, making a circuit in each 
lodge. At last the man on the beach jumped up, and seizing a club laid about 
him in a violent manner, hitting everything in his way. He, too, went the same 
round as the others, and after every lodge bad been visited, they all returned to the 
lodge from which they had issued, and the performances outdoor were closed for 
that day. In the meanwhile a deputation of fifteen or twenty men, with faces 
painted black and sprigs of evergreen in their hair, had been sent to the other villages 
with invitations for guests to come and receive presents. They went in a body to 
each lodge, and after a song and a chorus the spokesman of the party, in a loud 
voice, announced the object of their visit, and called the names of the invited per- 
sons. Anyone has a right to be present at the distribution, but only those specially 
invited wiU receive any presents. 

Every evening during the ceremonies, excepting those of the first few days, is 
devoted to masciiierade and other amusements, when each lodge is visited and a

performance enacted. ' * * The masks are made principally by tlio Clyoqnot 
and Kittiuat Indians, and sold to the Makahs, who paint them to suit their own 
fancies. They are inado of alder, maple, and cottouwood ; some are very ingeniously 
executed, having the eyes and lower jaw movable. By means of a string the per- 
former can make the eyes roll about, and the jaws gnash together with a fearfnl 
clatter. As these masks are kept strictly concealed until the time of the perform- 
ances, and as they are generally produced at night, they are viewed Avith awe by the 
spectators ; and certainly the scene in one of these lodges, dimly lighted by the fires 
which show the faces of the assembled spectators and illuminate the performers, 
presents a most weird and savage spectacle when the masked dancers issue forth 
from behind a screen of mats, and go through their barbarous pantomimes. The 
Indians themselves, even accustomed as they are to these masks, feel very much 
afraid of them, and a white man, viewing the scene for the first time, can only liken 
it to a carnival of demons. 

Among the masquerade performances that I have seen was a representation of 
mice. This was performed by a dozen or more young men who wert entirely 
naked. Their bodies, limbs, and faces were painted with stripes of red, blue, and 
black; red bark wreaths were twisted around their heads, and bows and arrows in 
their hands. They made a squealing noise, but otherwise they did nothing that 
reminded me of mice in the least. Another party was composed of naked boys, 
with bark fringes, like veils, covering their faces, and armed with sticks having 
needles in one end ; they made a buzzing noise and stuck the needles into any of the 
spectators who came in their way. This was a representation of hornets. These 
processions followed each other at an interv.al of half an hour, and c ich made a 
circuit round the lodge, performed some antics, sang some songs, shouted, and left. 
Another party then came in, composed of men with frightful masks, bearskins on 
their backs, and heads covered with down. They had clubs in their hands, and as 
they danced around a big fire blazing in the center of the lodge, they struck wildly 
with them, caring little whom or what they hit. One of their number was naked, 
with a rope round his waist, a knife in each hand, and. making a fearful howling. 
Two others had hold of the end of the rope, as if to keep him from doing any harm. 
This was the most ferocious exhibition I had seen, and the spectators got out of 
their reach as far as they could. They did no harm, however, excepting that one 
with his club knocked a hole through a brass kettle ; after which they left and went 
to the other lodges, where I learned that they smashed boxes and did much mischief. 
After they had gone, the owner examined his kettle, and quaintly remarked that it 
was worth more to hini than the jileasure he had experienced T)y their visit, and he 
should look to the man who broke it for remuneration. 

On a subsequent evening I was present at another performance. This consisted of 
dancing, jumping, firing of gnus, etc. A large fire was iirst built in the center of 
the lodge, and the })erformers, with painted faces, and many with masks resembling 
owls, wolves, and bears, crouched down with their arms clasped about their knees, 
their blankets trailing on the ground, and. fastened around the neck with a single 
pin. After forming in a circle with their faces toward the fire, they commenced 
jumping sideways round the blaze, their arms still about their knees. In this man- 
ner they whirled around for several minutes, producing a most remarkable appear- 
ance. These performers, who were male, were succeeded by some thirty women with 
blackened faces, their heads covered with down, and a girdle around their blankets. 
drawing them in tight at the waist. These danced around the fire with a shutitHng, 
ungainly gait, singing a song as loud as they could scream, which was accompanied 
by evei'youein the lodge, and beating time Avith sticks on boards placed before them 
for the purpose. When the dance was over, some iive or six men, with Avreathsof 
seaweed aronnd their heads, blackened faces, and bearskins over their shoulders, 
rushed in and fired a volley of musketry through the roof. One of them then made a 
speech, the purport of which was that the cereniouies had progressed favorably thus 
far; that their hearts had become strong, and that they felt ready to attack their 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 641 

enemies or to repel any attack upon thomselves. Their gnna having in the mean- 
while been loaded, another volley was fired, and the whole assembly uttered a shont 
to signify ai^proval. The performances during the daytime consisted of repre- 
sentations on the beach of various kinds. There was one representing a whaling 
scene. An Indian on all fours, covered with a bearskin, imitated the motion of a 
whale while blowing. He Avas followed by a party of eight men armed with liar- 
poous and lances, and carrying all the implements of whaling. Two boys, naked, 
with bodies rubbed over with Hour, and white cloths around their heads, rejiresented 
cold weather; others represented cranes moving slowly at the water's edge and 
occasionally dipping their heads down as if seizing a fish. They wore masks resem- 
bling a bird's beak, and bunches of eagles' feathers stuck in their hair. During all of 
these scenes the spectators kept up a continual singing and drumming. Every day 
during these performances feasts were given at different lodges to those Indians who 
had come from the other villages, at which great quantities of food were eaten and 
many cords of wood burned, the giver of the feast being very prodigal of his winter's 
supply of food and fuel. The latter, however, is procured quite easily from the for- 
est, and only causes a little extra labor'to obtain a sufficiency. 

The final exhibition of the ceremonies was the T'hlukloots representation, after 
which the presents were distributed. From daylight in the morning till about 11 
o'clock in the forenoon was occupied by indoor performances, consisting of singing 
and drumming, and occasional speeches. When these were over, some twenty per- 
formers, dressed up in masks and feathers, some with naked bodies, others covered 
with bearskins, and accompanied by the Avhole assembly, Avent down on the beach 
and danced and howled in the most frightful manner. After making as much uproar 
as they could, they returned to the lodge, and shortly after every one mounted on 
the roofs of the houses to see the performance of the T'hlukloots. First, a young 
girl came out upon the roof of a lodge, wearing a mask representing the head of the 
thunderbird, which was surmounted by a topknot of cedar bark dyed red and stuck 
full of Avhite feathers from eagles' tails. Over her shoulders she wore a red blanket 
covered with a profusion of w'hite buttons, brass thimbles, and blue beads; her hair 
hung doAvn her back, coA^ered Avith white down. The upper half of her face was 
painted black, and the loAver red. Another girl, Avith a similar headdress, Avas naked 
except a skirt al)Out her hips. Her arms and legs had rings of blue beads, and she 
wore bracelets of brass Avire around lier Avrists ; her face being painted like the 
other. A smaller girl had a black mask to resemble the ha-he'k-to-ak. The masks did 
not cover the face, luit were on the forehead, from Avhich tliey projected like horns. 
The last girl's face Avas also painted black and red. From her ears hung large orna- 
ments made of the haikwa or deutalium, and blue and red beads, and around her neck 
was an immense necklace of blue beads. Her skirt was also coA^ered Avith strings of 
beads, giving her quite a picturesque appearance. A little boy, Avith a black mask 
and headband of red bark, the ends of which hung down OA^er his shoulders, and 
eagles' feathers in a topknot, Avas the remaining performer. They moved around in 
a slow and stately nulnner, occasionally spreading out their arms to represent flying, 
and uttering a sound to imitate thunder, but which reseml)led the noiae made by 
the uighthaA\-k w'hen swooping for its prey, the spectators meauAvhile beating drums, 
pounding the roofs with sticks, and rattling Avith shells. This show lasted half an 
hour, Avhen all again Avent into the lodge to Avitness the distribution of i»resents and 
the grand finale. The company all being arranged, the performers at one end of the 
lodge and the A^•omen, children, and spectators at the other, they commenced by 
putting out the fires and remoAdng the brands and cinders. A quantity of feathers 
Avere streAved OA^er the ground floor of the lodge, and a dance and song commenced, 
eA'ery one joining in the latter, each seeming to try to make as much noise as possible. 
A large box, suspended by a rope from the roof, serA^ed as a bass drum, and other 
drums were improA ised from the brass and sheet-iron kettles and tin pans belonging 
to tlie domestic furniture of the house, Avhile tliose who had no kettles, pans, or 
boxes banged Avith their clubs on the roof and sides of the house till the noise Avas

almost deafening. In this uproar there was a pause ; then the din oonimenced anew. 
This time the dancers brought out blankets, and with them beat the feathers ou the 
floor till the whole air was filled with down, like flakes of snow during a heavy 
winter's storm. Another lull succeeded, then another dance, and another shaking 
up of feathers, till I was half choked with dust and down. Next the presents were 
distributed, consisting of blankets, guns, shirts, beads, and a variety of trinkets, 
and the whole aff'air wouud up with a feast. 

I presume the following custom belongs here as well. When the 
incantations and practices of the shaman are of no avail, the jjatieut is 
initiated in a secret society called tsa'yeq. Evidently this name is 
derived from the Kwakiutl word ts'a'eqa, thus suggesting that this cere- 
mony also was borrowed from the win- 
ter ceremonial of the Kwakiutl. I 
obtained the following description of 
these ceremonies : The members of the 
tsa'yeq assemble and make a circuit 
through the whole village, walking in 
Indian file and in a circle, so that their 
left hand is on the inner side (oppo- 
site the hands of a clock). Nobody is 
allowed to laugh while they are mak- 
ing their circuit. The tsa'yeq of the 
Hopetcisa'th and Ts'eca'ath sing as 
follows during this circuit: 

Ha, hil, hii', he is not a shaman.' 

When dancing, they hold the first 
fingers of both hands up, trembling 
violently. They enter all houses and 
take the ])atients and all the other peo- 
ple who desire to become members of 
the tsa'yeq along, two members of the 
society taking each novice between 
them and holding him by his hair, 
while they continue to shake their free 
hands. The novice nuist incline his 
head forward and shake it while the 
society are continuing their circuit. Thus they go from house to house, 
and all those who desire to become members of the society join the 
procession. The circuit finished, they assemble in a house in which 
during the following days none but members of the tsa'ye(| are 
allowed. They sing and dance for four days. After these days the 
novice obtains his cedar bark ornament (fig. 199 and Plate 51). Small 
carvings representing the crest of his sept are attached to the front 
j)art of the head ring. The dress of the ucta'qyu, the shaman, who is 
the most important member of the society, is larger than that of the 
other members.

Swan ^ lias described the ceremony as follows : 

The other performance is termed Tsiahk, and is a medicine performance, quite as 
interesting, but not as savage in its detail. It is only occasionally performed, when 
some person, either a chief or a member of his family, is sick. The Makahs believe 
in the existence of a supernatural being, who is represented to be an Indian of a 
dwarfish size, with long hair of a yellowish color flowing down his l)ack and cover- 
ing his shoulders. From his head grow four perpendicular horns, two at the temple 
and two back of the ears. When people are sick of any chronic complaint and much 
debilitated, they imagine they see this being in the night, who promises relief if the 
ceremonies he prescribes are well performed. The principal performer is a doctor, 
whose duties are to manipulate the patient, who is first initiated by secret rites into 
the mysteries of the ceremony. What these secret rites consist of I have not ascer- 
tained, but there is a continual singing and drumming during the day and evening 
for three days before spectators are admitted. I'rom the haggard and feeble appear- 
ance of some patients I have seen, I judge the ordeal must have been severe. The 
peculiarity of this ceremony consists in the dress worn alike by patients, novitiates, 
and performers. Both men and women assist, but the proportion of females is greater 
than of males. On the head of the female performer is worn a sort of coronet made 
of bark, surmounted by four upright bunches or little i)illars made of bark wound 
round with the same material, and sometimes threads from red blankets, to give a 
variety of color. I'rom the top of each of the four pillars, wliich represent the horns 
of the tsiahk, are bunches of eagles' quills, which have been notched and one side 
of the feather edge stripped off. In front is a band which is variously decorated, 
according to the taste of the wearer, with beads, brass buttons, or any trinkets they 
may have. From each side of this baud i)roject bunches of ({uills similar to those 
on the top of the head. The long hair of the tsiahk is represented by a heavy and thick 
fringe of bark, which covers the back and shoulders to the elbow\ Necklaces com- 
posed of a great many strings of beads of all sizes and colors, and strung in various 
forms, are also worn, and serve to add to the effect of the costume. The paint for the 
face is red for the forehead and for the lower part, from the root of the nose to the ears ; 
the portion between the forehead and the lower part is black, with two or three red 
marks on each cheek. The dress of the novitiate females is similar, with the excep- 
tion of there being no feathers or ornaments on the bark headdress, and with the 
addition of black or blue stripes on the red paint covering the forehead and lower 
portion of the face. The headdress of the men consists of a circular baud of bark 
and colored worsted, from the back part of which are two bunches of bark, like 
horses' tails. Two upright sticks are fastened to tlie band behind the ears, and 
on top of these "sticks are two white feathers tipped with red; the quill portion is 
inserted into a piece of elder stick with the pith extracted and then put on the band 
sticks. These sockets give the feathers the charm of vibrating as the Avearer moves 
his head; when dancing or moving in procession, the hands are raised as high as the 
face and the fingers si>read out. 

The doctor or principal performer has on his head a dress of plain bark similar to 
the female novitiate. He is naked except a piece of blanket about his loins, and 
his body is covered with stripes of red paint. The outdoor performance consists of 
a procession which moves from the lodge to the beach; the ])rincipal actor or con- 
ductor being at the head, followed by all the males in single file, the last one being 
the doctor. Immediately behind the doctor the patient follows, supported on each 
side by a female assistant. The females close up the procession. All parties, male 
and female, have their liands raised as high as their faces, and the motion of the 
procession is a sort of shuffling dance. They move in a circle which gradually closes 
around the jjatient, who, with the novitiate, is left seated on the ground in the cen- 
tre; songs with choruses by the whole of the spectators, drumming, shaking rattles, 
and firing of guns wind up the performance, and all retire to the lodge, where 



I "The Indians of Cape Flattery," page 73. 



644 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

dancing and singing are kept up for several days. Finally, presents are distributed, 
a ft-ast is held, and the friends retire. The patient and novitiates are obliged to 
wear their dress for one month. It consists of the bark lieaddress, having instead 
of feathers, two thin strips of wood, feather-shaped, but differently painted. Those 
of the jiaticnt are red at each end and white in the center, with narrow transverse 
bars of l)lMe. Those of the novitiate have blue ends and the center nnpainted. 
The patient's face is painted red, with ]>erpen(licular marks of blue on the forehead 
and the lower part of the face. The novitiate's foreliead and lower portion of face 
is painted with alternate strii)es of red and blue, the remainder of the face blue; the 
head band is also wound with bine yarn and yellow bark. The head band of the 
patient is Avound with red. The tails of bark of both headdresses are dyed red. The 
])atient carries in his hand a staff which can be used as a sujiport while walking ; this 
has red bark tied at each end and aronnd the middle. 

The Dukwally and Tsiahk are the performances more frequentlj' exhibited among 
the Makahs than any others, although they have several different ones. The ancient 
tanui'nawas is termed Do-t'hlub or Do-t'hlum,' and was formerly the favorite one. 
But after they had learned the T'hulkoots, or Thunder bird, they laid aside the 
Do-t'hhib, as its perfonnance, from the great number of ceremonies, was attended 
with too much trouble and expense. The origin of the Do-t'hlub was, as stated to 
me by the Indians, in this manner: Many years ago au Indian, while iishing in deep 
water for codfish, hauled up on his hook an immense haliotis shell. He had scarcely 
got it into his canoe when he fell into a trance, which lasted a few minutes, and on 
his recovery he commenced paddling home, but before reaching land he liad several 
of these trances, and on reaching the shore his friends took him up for dead, and 
carried him into his house, where he presently recovered, and stated that while in 
the state of stupor he had a vision of Do-t'hlub, one of their mythological beings, 
and that he must be dressed as Do-t'hlub was and then he would have revelations. 
He described the appearance, as he saw it in his vision, in which Do-t'hlub pre- 
sented himself with hands like deer's feet. He Avas naked to his liips, around which 
was a petticoat of cedar bark dyed red, which reached to his knees. His body and 
arms were red; his face painted red and black; his hair tied up in bunches with 
cedar twigs, and cedar twigs reaching down his back. When his friends had dressed 
him according to his direction, he fell into auotlicr trance, in which he saw the 
dances which were to be performed, heard the songs which were to be sung, and 
learned all tlie secret ceremonies to be observed. It was also revealed that each 
performer must have a piece of the haliotis shell in his nose, and pieces in his ears. 
He taught the rites to certain of his friends, and then performed before the tribe, 
who were so well pleased that they adopted the ceremony as their tama'nawas, and 
retained its observance for many years, till it was superseded bj^ the Dukwally. 
The haliotis shell worn by the Makahs in their noses is a custom originating from 
the Do-t'hlub. Other ceremonies are occasionally gone through with, but the 
description above given will serve to illustrate all those observed bj^ the Makahs. 
Different tribes have some peculiar to themselves, tlie general character of whicli is, 
however, the same. It will be seen that the public part of these performances are 
ratlier in the nature of amusements akin to our theatrical pantomimes than of 
religious observances, though they are religiously observed. 

THE LKU'NGEN. 

My information ou the ceremouials of the Coast Salish is very mea- 
ger. 1 obtained the folh)wiug information from the LkuTigEn, the 
tribe which occupies the territory near Victoria, British Columbia. 
They have two secret societies, the tcyiyi'wan and the xEnxani'tEl 
(dog howlers). 

' This is clearly the Kwakiutl word no'nLEm. 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 645 

Any member of tlie tribe may join the tcyiyi'wan. When desiring- 
to do so, he retires into the woods and stays there for some time, bath- 
ing in ponds and washing- his body with cedar branches. The intend- 
ing novice is called xansa'loknL. Finally he dreams of the dance 
which he will i)erform and the song which he will sing. In his dream 
his soul is led all over the world by the spirit who gives him his dance 
and his song. Then he returns to the village. According to what he 
has dreamed, he belongs to one of five societies which constitute the 
tcyiyi'wan: (1) The sqe/iep, who dance with elbows pressed close to 
the body, the arms extended forward and moving up and down; (2) 
the nuxsofi'wcqa, who jump about in wild movements ; (3) the sqii'qoaL, 
who danc(^ in slow movements; (4) the sqoie'lec, whose dance is said to 
be similar to that of the sqe'iep, and (5) the tcilqtE'nEn (derived from 
tca'loq woods). The general name of the dances of the tcyiyi'wan is 
me'iLa, which word is borrowed from the Kwakiutl. When the novice 
returns from the woods, he teaches for two days his song to the mem- 
bers of the society to which he is to belong. Then the dance is per- 
formed and henceforth he is a regular member of the society. 

The xEnxanl'tEl, the second society, are also called Lo'koala and 
nd'uLEm, although the first name is the proper Lku'ngEn term. The 
LkuTigEn state that they obtained the secrets of this society from the 
Kootka, and this is undoubtedly true. It appears that the secrets of 
these societies spread from the Xootka to the LkuTigEn, Clallam, and 
the tribes of Puget Sound. The Tc'a/tELp, a sept of the Sanitch tribe, 
also have the no'uLEm, while the Snanai'muX, the Cowichan, and the 
tribes of Fraser Eiver have hardly a trace of it. The Comox and Pent- 
latch obtained it through intermarriage with both the Kwakiutl and the 
Kootka. 

The right to perform the no'uLEm is jealously guarded by all tribes 
who possess it, and many a war has been waged against tribes who 
'illegitimately performed the ceremonies of the society. Its mysteries 
were kept a profound secret, and if a man dared to speak about it he 
was torn to pieces by the quqq'e'lEn, about whom I shall speak pres- 
ently. Only rich people can become members of the xEnxanl'tEl, as 
heavy payments are exacted at the initiation. If the father of the 
novice is not able to pay them, his relatives must contribute to the 
amount required. The initiation and the festivals of this society 
take place in winter only. When a young man is to be initiated, his 
father first invites the xEnxanl'tEl to a feast, which lasts five days. 
During these days mask dances are performed, which those who are not 
members of the society are also permitted to witness. They occupy 
one side of the house in which the festivities take place, while the 
XEnxanl'tEl occupy the other. The latter wear head ornameiits of cedar 
bark and have their hair strewn with down. The faces of all those 
who take part in the festival are blackened. At the end of three days 
the lather of the novice invites four men to bathe his son in the sea. 



646 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

One of tliem must wash his body, one must wash his head, and the 
two others hokl him. In return they receive one or two blankets each. 
During" this ceremony the quqq'e/lEu, who are described as wild men, 
dance around the novice. They have ropes tied around their waists, 
and are held by other members of the society by these ropes. Then 
the xEnxanl'tEl lead the novice into the woods, where he remains for a 
long time, until he meets the spirit that initiates him. It seems that 
during this time he is secretly led to tlie house in which the xEuxani'tEl 
continue to celebrate festivals at the expense of the novice's father, 
and thei'e he is taught the secrets of the society. During this time, 
until the return of the novice from the woods, the house is tabooed. 
A watchman is stationed at the entrance, who keeps out uninitiated 
l^ersons. During the absence of the novice, his mother prepares cedar 
bark ornaments and weaves mountain goat blankets for his use. One 
afternoon he returns, and then his father gives a feast to let the people 
know that his child has returned. The latter performs his first dance, 
in which he uses masks and cedar bark ornaments. This dance is 
called luixnEa/mEfi. On this day the father must distribute a great 
number of blankets among the xEuxanl'tEl. The initiated are per- 
mitted to take part in the feast, and sit on one side of the house. The 
new member spends all his nights in the woods, where he bathes. In 
the spring the new member, if a man, is thrown into the sea, and after 
that is free from all regulations attending the initiation. One of the 
principal regulations regarding novices of the xEnxanl'tEl is that they 
must return from the woods in the direction in which the sun is mov- 
ing, starting so that the sun is at their backs. Therefore they must 
sometimes go in roundabout ways. They must go backward through 
doors, which are sLa/lEqam (supernatural) against them. Frequently 
the sio'ua (a, female shaman) is called to bespeak the door in their 
behalf before they pass through it. Before their dance the sio'ua must 
also address the earth, as it is supposed that else it might open and 
swallow up the dancer. It is also sLa'lEqam against t]\e novice. The 
expression used is that the earth would "open its eyes" (k'u'ualasEn); 
that means, swallow the novice. In order to avert this danger, the 
sio'ua must " give a name to the earth," and strew red paint and feathers 
over the place where the novice is to dance. 

THE Bl'LXULA. 

The social organization, festivals, and secret societies of the Bi'lxula 
are still more closely interrelated than they are among the Kwakiutl, 
and must be considered in connection. We have to describe here the 
potlatch, the sisau'k-, and the kfi'siat. The sisau'k* corresponds to 
the Lao'laxa of the northern Kwakiutl tribes, the ku'siut to the 
ts'e'ts'aeqa. The Bi'lxula believe that the potlatch has been insti- 
tuted by ten deities, nine brothers and one sister, the foremost among 
whom is Xe'mtsioa, to whose care the sunrise is intrusted. He resides 
with the others in a beautiful house in the far east, and cries "o, o," 



THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 647 

every moriiiiig wlien the sun rises. He takes care that he rises prop- 
erly. The first six of these deities are grouped iu pairs, and are 
believed to paint their faces with designs representing moon, .stars, 
and rainbow. In the ku'siut these deities make their appearance, and 
are represented by masks. Xe/mtsioa and Xemxemala'oLa wear the 
design of the full moon, indicated on the mask of Xe'mtsioa by a 
double curved line in red and black, the black outside, passing over 
forehead, cheeks, and upper lip. XemxemakVoLa has a double curved 
line in red and black, the red outside, which passes over forehead, 
cheeks, and chin. Aiumkl'lik-a and Aiumala'oLa wear the design of 
the crescent, drawn in red and black, with differences similar to those 
between tlie first and second masks. The fifth Q'omq'omkl'lik-a and 
Q'o'mtsloa have designs representing stars, both wearing the same 
style of mask. The seventh is Qula'xawa, whose face represents the 
blossom of a salmon-berry bush. The next in order, KuleTias (who 
wants to have blankets first), wears the design of the rainbow in 
black and blue. The ninth, At'ama'k, wears on the head a mask repre- 
senting a kingfisher, and is clothed in a bird-skin blanket. The last 
of the series is a woman called L'etsa'apleLaua (the eater), the sister of 
the others. Her fsice is painted with the design of a bladder filled with 
grease. She figures in several legends as stealing provisions and pur- 
sued by the people whom she has robbed. 

The sisau'k-, which is danced at potlatches and other festivals of 
the clans, is presided over by a being that lives in the sun. A man who 
had gone out hunting met the sisau'k- and was instructed by him in the 
secrets of the dance. When he returned, he asked the people to clean 
their houses and to strew them with clean sand before he consented to 
enter. Then he danced the sisau'k- and told the people what he had 
seen. He said that the being had commanded them to perform this 
dance and to adorn themselves when dancing with carved headdresses 
with trails of ermine skins, and to swing carved rattles. The man, 
later on, returned to the sun. Ever since that time the Bi'lxula dance 
the sisau'k-. Besides this, it is stated that the raven gave each clan its 
secrets. Each clan has its jieculiar carvings, which are used in the 
sisau'k' only, and are otherwise kept a profound secret, i. e., they are 
the sacred possessions of each clan. All clans, however, wear the beau- 
tiful carved headdresses and use the raven rattles, regardless of the 
carving they represent. Every time the sacred objects of a clan are 
shown to the people a potlatch is given. The sacred objects, although 
the property of the various clans, must nevertheless be acquired by 
each individual — that is to say, every free person has the right to 
acquire a certain group of carvings and names, according to the clan 
to which he or she belongs. Slaves and slaves' children, also illegiti- 
mate children, can not become sisau'k-. A person can not take a 
new carving, but must wait until it is given to him by his relatives — 
father, mother, or elder brother. Xusk'Elu'sta, the Indian, to whom I 



648 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

owe my iuformation regarding tlie clans, and who is a member of the 
gens lalo'stimdt of the Talio'mx-, stated that he had received the raven 
when he gave his first potlatch. At his second pothitch he received 
the eagle. He hoped that his mother would give him the whale at his 
next potlatch, and would at the same time divulge to him the secrets con- 
nected with it. In course of time, he said, he might get even others 
from his brother; but if the latter's children should prove to be ver^^ 
good, and develop very rapidly, his brother would probably give his 
secrets to his own children. At festivals, when a person acquires a new 
secret, he changes his name. Each person has two names, a kii'siut 
name, which remains through life, and a Xe/mtsioa name, which is 
changed at these festivals. Thus, Nusk'Elu'sta's (which is his ku'siut 
name) Xe'mtsioa name was AL'iLEmuE'Ius'aix', but at his next pot- 
latch he intended to take the name of Kalia'kis. These names are 
also the property of the various clans, each clan having its own names. 
When a man jjossesses several sisau'k* secrets, he will distribute them 
among his children. When a girl marries, her father or mother may, 
after a child has been born to her, give one or several of their sisau'k- 
secrets to her husband, as his children make him a member of her clan. 
When a person grows old, he gives away all his sisau'k- secrets. After 
any secret has been given away the giver must not use it any more. 
The crest and the sisau'k- carvings must not be loaned to others, 
but each person must keep his own carvings. The only exceptions are 
the carved headdresses and the raven rattles, which are not the 
property of any particular clan. 

The laws regarding the potlatch are similar to those of the Kwakiutl. 
The receiver of a present becomes the debtor of the person who gave 
the potlatch. If the latter should die, the debts become due to his 
heirs. If the debtor should die, his heirs become responsible for the 
debt. Property is also destroyed at potlatches. This is not returned, 
and serves only to enhance the social position of the individual who 
performed this act. It is not necessary that all the property given by 
a person in a potlatch should be owned by him. He may borrow part 
of it from his friends, and has to repay it with interest. I was told, 
for instance, that a man borrowed a large copper plate and burnt it at a 
potlatch. When doing so, he had to name the price which he was going 
to pay the owner in its stead. Since that feast he died, and his heirs 
are now responsible for the amount named at the potlatch. 

The ku'siut is i)resided over by a female spirit, called Anafdikuts'- 
ai'x-. Her abode is a cave in the woods, which she keeps shut from 
February till October, remaining all the while inside. In October she 
opens the door of her cave and sits in front of it. A w^oman is said to 
have been the first to find her. Anaidikuts'ai'x* invited her into her 
cave and taught her the secrets of the ku'siut. She wore ornaments 
of red cedar bark around her head, waist, and ankles; her face was 
blackened, her hair strewn with eagle down. She commanded the

woman to dance in the same way as she saw her dancing. The people 
sliould accompany her dance with songs, and, after she had finished, 
they shoiikl dance with masks. She said, "Whenever a person sees 
me, your people shall dance the ku'siut. If you do not do so, I shall 
punish you with death and sickness. In summer, while 1 am in my 
house, you must not dance the ku'siut." 

Ever since that time the Bi'lxula dance the ku'siut. When a man 
has seen Anafdikuts'ai'x- sitting in front of her cave, he will invite the 
people to a kfi'siut. A ring made of red and Avhite cedar bark is hung 
up in his house, and the uninitiated are not allowed to enter it. Only 
in the evening, when dances are performed, they may look on, standing 
close to the door. As soon as the dances are over, they must retire 
from the taboo house. Each ku'siut lasts three days. 

The various dances performed by members of the ku'siut are also 
property of the clans, and the right to perform them is restricted to 
members of the clan. They must not be given to a daughter's hus- 
band, as is the case with the sisau'k- dances, but belong to the mem- 
bers of the clan, wlio have a right to a particular dance, but who do 
not own it. Permission to use a mask or dance is obtained from the 
owner by payments. The owner may reclaim the dance or the borrower 
may return it at any time. Membership of the ku'siut is obtained 
througli an initiation. At this time the novice is given his ku'siut 
name, which is inherited by young persons from their parents or from 
other relatives. Thus a young man who had the name of Po'po until 
he was about seventeen years old, obtained at his initiation the name 
of L'ako'oL. I have not reached a very clear understanding of the 
details of the initiation; it seems that the dance is simply given to the 
novice in the same way as the sisau'k*, this initiation being connected 
with a potlatch. But still it seenis possible that he must "dream" of the 
dance which he is to perform. Only the highest degrees of the ku'siut 
have to pass through a religious ceremony of some importance. The 
highest degrees are the Elaxo'La (the ha'mats'a of the Kwakiutl), the 
o'lEx (the nu'LmaL of the Kwakiutl), and the da'tia (the no'ntsistalaL 
of the Kwakiutl). These grades are also hereditary. A ku'siut novice 
may acquire them at once at his first initiation. 

When the Elaxo'La is initiated, he goes into the forest, where he 
encounters his guardian spirit. It is believed that he goes up to the 
sun, and formerly he had to take human flesh along for food. The 
chiefs held a council the night preceding the beginning of the cere- 
monies, and anyone who wanted to show his liberality offered one of 
his slaves to be killed in order to serve as food for the Elaxo'La. The 
offer was accei)ted, and a payment of from ten to twenty blankets was 
made for the slave. The latter was killed, and the members of the 
Elaxo'La order devoured one-half of the body before the departure of 
the novice to the woods. There the latter was tied up and left to fast. 
He may stay there for twenty or thirty days until the spirit appears

to liini and takes liim up to the sim, where lie is initiated. Early one 
morning- he returns, and is heard outside the houses. He has lost all 
his hair, AA'hich, it is believed, has been torn out by the strong breeze 
blowing in the higher regions. He is quite naked, and bites everyone 
whom he can lay hold of. If he can not catch anyone he will bite his 
own arm. It is believed that he has lost his soul, which fled from the 
body when the spirit came to him. Therefore the shamans must try 
for four days to recapture his soul. The night after they have recov- 
ered it the ElaxO'La dances, clothed in a l)earskin and wearing a large 
head ring, heavy bracelets and anklets, all made of red cedar bark. 
Sometimes he appears wearing the mask of the S'a'Lpsta (fig. 200), 
the spirit which initiated him. This mask corresponds exactl}^ to that 
of BaxbakualanuXsI'wae of the Kwakiutl. Some ElaxO'La do not 

bite people, but merely 
devour raw salmon or 
tear dogs to pieces and 
devour them. Those who 
bite people will also 
devour corpses. The 
Elaxo'La has to observe 
a number of regulations. 
For four years after his 
initiation he must not 
gamble. He must stay away from his wife for one 
year, but this period is being reduced to one month. 
For two or three months he must not leave his house. 
Tlie o'Iex (the laugher) and the da'tia (the thrower) 
do not go into the woods to be initiated, but both 
must fast three days before their lirst dance. The 
o'Iex "makes fun of everything" and scratches i^eo- 
ple with his nails. The da/tia carries stones and 
sticks and breaks household goods and canoes. If he 
has destroyed some object during the day, he pays for 
it at night when he dances. The o'Iex and the da'tia, 
after they have danced, must stay in their houses for one month. 

If a person transgresses the laws of the ku'siut, for instance, when 
the Elaxo'La gambles, or when a man x)erforms a dance to which he 
has no right, also when a person derides the ceremonies or makes a 
mistake in dancing, his i)vinishment is death. The chiefs assemble in 
council and the offender is called before the court. After his offense 
has been proved, he is asked whether he is willing to suffer the penalty 
of death. If he is not willing and one of his relatives is found willing 
to take the penalty on himself, the guilty party is spared and the sub- 
stitute killed in his stead. The execution of the judgment is intrusted 
to the shaman, who bewitches the condemned person by throwing dis- 
ease into him or by poisoning him in some otlier (supernatural?) way. 
The object thrown by the shaman is a shell, bone, or finger nail, around

the middle of wbicb objects a human hair is tied. If this object 
strikes the oflemler, he will fiill sick. Blood is believed to collect in 
his stomach, and if it so happens that he vomits this blood, and with 
it the disease-producing object, he will recover, and is not molested 
any further. The masks (not the whistles and other ornaments) used 
in the ku'siut are burnt immediately at the close of each dancing sea- 
son. Novices must wear a necklace of red 
cedar bark over their blankets for a whole 
year. The masks used in the dances repre- 
sent mythical personages, and the dances are 
pantomimic re]>resentations of myths. Among 
others, the thunder bird and his servant, 
ALxula'tEuum (who wears a mask with red 
and blue stripes over the whole face from the 
right-hand upper side to the left-hand lower 
side, and carries a staff with red and blue 
spiral lines), appear in the dances. Prominent 
masks are also Xc/mtsioa and his brothers 
and his sisters; Masmasahl'nix and his fel- 
lows, the raven and the nusxe'mta, and many 
others.^ 

THE TSIMSHIAN, NtSQA', HAIDA, AND 
TLTNGIT. 

The tribes of this group learned the ceremo 
nial avowedly from the Hc'iltsuq. Although 
1 have not witnessed any x)art of their ceremo- 
nials, the descriptions which I received bring 
out with sufficient clearness its similarities to 
the winter ceremonial of the Kwakiutl. The 
ceremonials seem to be almost identical among 
all these tribes. It is most complete among the 
southwestern Tsimshian tribes, particularly 
theG'itxa'La, but has been adopted by all the 
tribes of the coast. It is said that it reached 
the Uaida not more than a hundred years ago. 

I will tell here what I learned from the Msqa'. They have six 
societies, which rank in the following order: The sEmhalai't, mciLa', 
loLE'm, Olala', nanesta/t, honaua''L, the last being the highest. The 
SEmhalai't is really not confined to the Avinter ceremonial, but is 
obtained when a person accpiires the first guardian spirit of his clan 
and performs the ceremony belonging to this event. The tradition of 
the origin of these ceremonies localizes the events at Bellabella, and it

is added that the G'itxa'La, after having acquired the ceremonial from 

tlie Hr'/iltsiKj, transmitted it to the Nisqa'. This report is corroborated 

by linguistic evidence. All the names of the societies, witli the sole 

exception of the first, are of Kwakiutl derivation. (meiLa', teasing; 

htLE'm, Kwakiutl no'uLEm; olala', name of a Kwakiutl dance; 

nanesta't, Kwakiutl nontsistil'laL; lionana', 

dance of ). The cry of the olala', 

"hnp," is also a Kwakiutl word meaning 
eating, and is the same as the cry of the 
hil/mats'a. The original tradition mentions 
three societies only — the second, third, and 
fourth. This shows that the first one is not 
a secret society, properly speaking, and that 
the fifth and sixth are later importations. 
The ISTisqa' state that with the ceremonies 
came the use of large whistles. I will give 
the ISTisqa' tradition of the origin of the secret 
societies : 

A Wutsda' (He'iltsuq), named Sagaitlfi'ben 
(a Nisqa' or Tsimshian name), went hunting. 
He saw a bear, which he pursued. He shot 
it several times, but was unable to kill it. 
Finally the bear 
reached a steep cliff, 
which opened and let 
him in. When the 

rock opened, the hunter heard the voices of the 

olala' crying '^nlp," and he fainted. Then his 

soul was taken into the house. In the rear of 

the house he saw a large room partitioned off. 

The partition was hung with red cedar bark. 

It was the secret room of the olala'. To the 

right of the door, on entering, was a secret room 

for the meiLa', and to the left of the door one 

for the loLE'm. The chief, who was sitting in 

the rear of the house, ordered a fire to be made, 

and spoke: "Those here are the meiLa'; they 

did not bring you here. Those are the loLe'm; 

they eat dogs ; they did not bring you here. But 

these are the dlala' ; they eat men ; they brought 

you here. You shall imitate what they are 

doing." The chief had a heavy ring of red cedar bark around his neck, 

a ring of tlie same material on his head, and wore a bearskin. He 

said: "You must use the same ornaments when you return to your 

people." He took a whistle out of his own mouth and gave it to 

SaSaitla'bEn. He gave him his small neck ring of cedar bark, which

instilled into him the desire of devouring men (tlierefore it is called 
(j'atsx Em lox*, cedar bark throat), and he gave him large cedar bark 
rings aud a small bearskin, which enabled him to iiy. He told him: 
"You shall kill men, you shall eat them, and carry them to my house." 
And he opened the door. The singers sang and beat time, and SaSnit- 
la'bEn flew away. He flew from town to town over the whole world, 
crying "hap " all the time. He went from 
the country of the Wutsda' to Skeena 
River, and then to Nass Eiver. Some- 
times he was seen on high cliffs. He 
killed and devoured people whom he 
found in the woods. 

After three years he was seen near the 
village of the G-it'amil't. They attemi)ted 
to catch him. They killed dogs and 
threw them into a hole, and a number of 
shamans hid under a canoe near by. 
Soon he was heard to approach. He 
alighted on the top of a dry cedar. He 
lay there on his stomach, and the point of 
the tree was seen to penetrate his body 
and to pierce it. But it did not kill him. 
When he saw the dead dogs, he flew 
down, and after he had eaten, the sha- 
mans rushed up to him, caught him, and 
took him up to the house. They tried to 
cure him, and the people sang olala' songs 
(all of which have a five-part rhythm). 
He tried to fly again, but was unable to 
get out of the house. Finally he was 
tamed and became like other men. Then 
the G-it'ama't took him back to his friends 
and received in return many slaves, cop- 
pers, and canoes. 

The ceremonies take place in the month 
called Lok'S Em guna'k (cold month, or 
December). 

In his dances the dlala' of all the north- 
ern tribes use headdresses Avliich repre- 
sent a corpse (tigs. 201-204). The whistles 
which are used to imitate the cries of the 
spirit are large and give a deep, hollow sound. They are all carved 
or painted with the design of the head of a corpse, either with hollow 
orbits or with closed eyes. Some of these whistles (figs. 205-207) are 
attached to bellows. They are carried under the arms, hidden by the 
blankets, and thus blown without being seen. The rattles which are 
carried by the companions of the dancer show also the same design.

The loLE'm dance in a two-part rhythm; their call is a sharp "h,h;" 
their movements sudden jerks of the forearms, first the left moving up 
to the shoulder while the right moves down, 
and vice versa. 

The meiLa' dance in a three-part rhytlim. 
Their headdress is a heavy ring of red cedar 
bark, with a beaver tail standing np in its 
middle. The ring is studded with small sticks, 
which represent arrows (fig. 208). 

The nanesta't and honana/L correspond to the 
no'ntsistsllaL of the Kwakiutl. When the 
members of these societies are in a state of 
ecstasy, they throw firebrands about and de- 
stroy canoes, houses, and anything they can lay 
their hands on. They carry lances like the 
nu'LuniL. The rat- 
tles used by all these 
societies are round, 
and correspond to 
those of the Kwaki- 
utl (figs. 209-213). 
The insignia of 
these societies are made of cedar bark dyed 
red m a decoction of alder bark. For each 
repetition of the ceremony a new ring is 
added to the head 
ornament of the dan- 
cer. Those of the 
loLE'm and olala' 
consist of rings 
placed one on top 
of the other. The 
meiLa' receives first 
a red ring, the second 
time a Avhite ring, 
and so on, alternatiu| 
together. 

There are only a limited number of places in 
the societies, and a new member can be admit- 
ted only when he inherits the place of a deceased 
member, or when a member transfers his place 
to him. If such a transfer is to take x^lace, the 
consent of the chiefs of the clans must first be 
obtained. Then one evening the chiefs, during 
a feast, surround the youth and act as though they had caught the 
spirit of the society in their hands and throw it upon the novice. If

They place him on an elk skin, carry him around the fire, then they 
throw the youth upward and show the people that he has vanished. 
After some time, when the novice is expected back, tlie people assem-

back by the help of their spirits. In order to do this, they dance w th 
the head ornaments of their clans, their rattles, dancing blankets, 
aprons, and leggings, or they use the head ornament representing two 
bears' ears, which is made of bearskin set witli woman's hair, dyed 
red. This ornament is used by all clans, or they wear masks repre- 
senting their guardian spirits. 

As an example of these, I will describe the spirit of sleep, Arhich 
belongs to the G-IspawaduwE'da. The owner of this spirit appears 
sleeping, his face covered witli a mask, the eyes of which are shut (fig. 



656 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



214, ]). 659). Then a chief «tei)s up and tries to awaken him by haulinj? 
the drowsiness out of hiin with both liis hands. Then the eyes of the 
mask are opened and roll, while the man who wears the mask rises. 
The chief who took the drowsiness out of the sleeper asks if he shall 
try to put the people to sleei), and on being asked to do so he opens his 
hands. The spirit is supposed to enter the people, and all close their 
eyes. After some time he gathers the drowsiness again, and the people 
awake and sing: 

oil, how sleepy wc are; oh, how sleepy we arc, 

Wheu the heat of the heaven strikes me, drowsiness comes upon me, 

brouf^ht by the husljand of the slee]). 
Oh, how sleepy we are; oh, how sleepy we are.' 

In this manner the spirit of sleep proves his i)resence and is asked to 
try to bring back the novice. 

Figure 215 (p. GOO) shows another mask, which is 
used in a similar way. It rejnesents the cold. The 
staring eyes, the chattering mouth, express the 
extreme cold from which the wearer is suffering. 

One dancer after another tries to bring back the 
novice. If he does not return by midnight of the 
first night, the ceremony is interrupted, and con- 
tinued the following night. On one occasion a 
member of the Iole'iu was the last to try. He took 
his supernatural heljier, a small, carved human 
image, held it up, and asked it to bring back the 
novice. Then he poured a spoon of grease into 
the tire and threw the carving after it. At once the 
whistles of the novice were heard on the roof. All 
the loLE'm rushed out of the house, but soon they 
returned, saying that they had seen him, but lost 
him again. They cried, "e" (drawn out very long). 
Then all the people left the house. 

After the novice is lost in this manner, he is 
expected back on the following day. Early in the 
morning a killer whale or some other animal is 
seen on the river, carrying the novice on its back. He is crying "ma, 
ma, ma, ma," all the time, and the people go to see him. The loLE'm 
take a canoe and paddle singing toward the novice. When they have 
almost reached him, one of their number, who stays ashore clad in a 
bearskin, drives all the people into the houses. The Iole'ui take the 
novice into their canoe and destroy the whale float which carried him, 
and which is manipulated by means of ropes. Then he runs up and 
down the street like one wild, and the olala' follow him and bite any 
of the profane who dare to leave the house. The novice catches a dog, 
tears it to pieces, and eats it while he is going from house to house.

When he thus returns, he is entirely naked. From the time when 
he enters his house it becomes tabooed. A rope hung with red cedar 
bark is stretched from the door of the house to a pole erected on the 
beach, preventing the people from passing in front of the house and 
compelling them to go behind. A large ring of red cedar bark is fas- 
tened to the pole in front of the house. These remain on the house for 
a day after the return of the novice. On the following day four men 
put on bearskins and place rings of red cedar bark on their heads. Thus 
attired, they go from house to house inviting the people to see thedance 
of the novice and to learn his songs. When the people have assembled, 
the uncle of the novice spreads blankets on the floor, on which the 
youth dances. Then his uncle pays the 
chiefs who tried to bring him back, and 
distributes blankets among the other jieo- 
ple also. He gives a feast, in which two 
kinds of berries are served, each mixed 
with grease. Chiefs are given large spoons 
filled with grease. Their people help them 
to eat the contents, as they must not 
leave any of the food that they receive. 
After the ceremony the novice is called 
Laamg-a't (a i^erfect man). 

People who want to become members of 
the olala' must have been shamans first. 

The following description of the initia- 
tion of an olala' was given by a man who 
had gone through the ceremony himself, 
but who is a Christian now. It is a question 
to my mind whether the ceremonies at the 
grave, about which he told me, were actu- 
ally performed, or whether he reflected only 
the dread in which the olala' were held. 

During a festival when he was to be in- 
itiated, his friends pretended to begin a ^''^" 
quarrel. They drew knives and pretended to kill him. They let him 
disappear, and cut oft' the head of a dummy, which had been skillfully 
introduced. Then they laid the body down, covered it, and the women 
began to mourn and to wail. His relatives gave a feast, distributed 
blankets, slaves, canoes, and coppers, and burnt the body. In short, 
they held a regular funeral. 

After his disappearance, the young man resorted to a grave. He 
took the body oMt of the grave and wrapped the blanket about himself 
and the body. Thus he lay with the corpse for a whole night. The 
other olala' watched him from a distance. In the morning he put the 
body back into the grave. He continued to do so for some time, in order 
to acquire courage. All this time and for a whole year after he was 
not seen by any member of the tribe except by the olala'.

begun. He lias a spoou and adish of his own. These are wound withred 

cedar bark. Those who have formerly been olala' are the servants of 

the new member of the society and bring him food. When he hears 

the word lo'lEk (ghost), he grows excited and 

begins to bite again. After he ceases to bite 

and to devour human flesh, a heavy ring of red 

cedar bark is placed around his neck, and he 

is led slowly around the fire. The ceremony is 

called "nuiking him heavy" (sEp'a'lyix), and 

means that he is by this weight prevented from 

flying away and growing excited again. After 

his initiation he must stay in his room for a 

whole year. After biting, he must chew the 

bark of "devil's club" (woo'mst), which acts 

as a purgative. 

I received the following description from the 

Tsimshian. It seems that their customs and 

those described before are practically identical. 
During the dancing season a feast is given, 

and while the women are dancing the novice 

is suddenly said to have disappeared. It is 

supposed that he goes to heaven. If he is a 

child, he stays away four days ; youths remain 

about six days, and grown-up persons several 

months. Chiefs are supposed to stay in heaven during the fall and the 

entire winter. When this period has elapsed, they suddenly reappear 
near the beach, carried by an artificial monster 
belonging to their crest. Then all the members 
of the secret society to wliich the novice is to 
belong gather and walk down in grand proces- 
sion to the beach to fetch the child. At this time 
his parents bring presents, particularly elk skins, 
strung upon a rope as long as the procession, to 
be given at a subsequent feast. The people sur- 
round the novice and lead him into every house 
in order to show that he has returned. Then he 
is taken to the house of his parents, and a large 
bunch of red cedar bark is fastened over the door 
to show that the house is tabooed and nobody 
is allowed to enter. The chief sings while the 
cedar bark is being fastened. In the afternoon 
the sacred house is prepared for the dance. A 
section in the rear of the house is divided ofi" by 

means of curtains; it is to serve as a stage on which the dancers and 

the novice appear. When all is ready, messengers, carrying large 

carved batons, are sent around to invite the members of the society, the

Chief first. The Avomen sit down iu oue row, uicely dressed up in button 
blankets and tlieir faces painted red. The chief wears the amhalait-a 
carving rising from the forehead, set with sea-lion barbs, and with a 
long drapery of ermine skins (see Plate 47) -the others, the cedar bark 
rings ot their societies. Then the women begin to dance. After a 
while a prominent man rises to deliver a speech. He says- "All Jf 
you know that our novice went up to heaven ; then he made a mistake 
and has been returned; now you will see him." Then ho begins the 
song; the curtain is drawn and masked dancers are seen surroundiu- 
the novice and representing the spirits which he has encountered in 
heaven. At the same time eagle down is blown into the air After 
the dance is over the presents which were strung on the rope are dis- 
tributed among the members of the secret society. 

The novice has a beautifully painted room set apart for his use He 
remains naked during the dancing season. He must not look into the 
fire. He must abstain from food and drink, and 
is only allowed to moisten his lips occasionally. 
He wears his head ring continually. After the 
ceremonies are all finished the festival of " clothing 
the novice" is celebrated. He sits in his room 
quietly singing while the people assemble in the 
house. His song is heard to grow louder, and at 
last he makes his appearance. He has put off his

Tsimshian. tics take part in this feast, each sitting grouped 

"'"'^':^::Z:uI"'''' together. The uninitiated stand at the door. This 
ends the ceremonies. 
The initiations are repeated from time to time, and the rank of a per- 
son becomes the higher the more frequently he has gone through the 
ceremony; but nobody, chiefs excepted, can be a member of more than 
one secret society. The sEmhalai't are in so far a preparatory step to 
the societies, as everybody who wants to enter them must have acquired 
the SEmhalai't first. A member of one (,f the other societies, namely, 
the meiLa', nouLE'm or olala', can not enter any other society, but 
remains in the society in which he has been initiated. Those who have 
passed twice through the sEmhalai't ceremonies are called ts'e'ik. 

XIV. The Growth of the Secret Societies. 

The secret societies of the Kwakiutl, as we know them nowadays 
are undoubtedly a complex growth. We will endeavor to elucidate, so 
far as possible, the history of their development by means of ihe 
material presented in the preceding paper. 

A coniparison of the ceremonials of the various tribes of the i^orth 
l-acific Coast, which were briefly described in the last chapter, does

not leave any doubt that they are in the main derived from the same 
source. ]Sot only are the ceremonials much alike, but even their names 
are identical. Among all the tribes, the badges of the ceremonials are 
made of cedar bark, which is dyed red in the juice of the alder. Head 
rings, neck rings, and masks are worn by the dancers. The perform- 
ances themselves are essentially the same from Alaska to Juan de Fuca 
Strait. But the most certain proof of their common origin lies in the 
identity of name among the various tribes. Among the Haida, Tlingit, 
and Tsimshian we find the names olala, me'iLa, and no'uLEm, which 
belong to the ceremonial of the Kwakiutl as well. Among the Bilxula 
the names can not be derived from the same words as among the other 
tribes, but there the ceremonial itself is almost identical with that of 
the Kwakiutl. It certainly does not differ more from the ceremonial as 
described here than that of other tribes of Kwakiutl lineage differs 
from the ceremonial of the Kwakiutl proper. Besides this, the names 
of the dancers, if not those of their dances, are very often borrowed 
from the Kwakiutl. Turning to the south, Ave find the Nootka as well 
as the Salishan tribes who practice the ceremonial, terming it by the 
two names Lo'koala and no'uLEm, both of which are names used for 
portions of the ceremonial of the Kwakiutl. 

The following tal)le exhibits the terms that are used to designate 
parts of the -ceremonial among various tribes:

As all the words which I have enumerated belonged originally to the 
Kwakiutl language, there can be no doubt that the ceremonial of the 
Kwakiutl has influenced those of the neighboring tribes to a very 
great extent. It does not follow necessarily that no secret societies 
existed before the Kwakiutl exerted their influence over the people of 
the coast. On the contrary, the wide distribution of secret societies 
and the general similarity of the underlyiug principle all over North 
America make it probable that such societies did exist. But there can 
be no doubt that their present character was attained among the 
Kwakiutl, from whom the societies in their present form spread over a 
vast territory.' 

The question then arises. How did the societies acquire their peculiar 
characteristics among the Kwakiutl ? I may be allowed at this place to 

'It can not be proved that any connection exists between the hawI'nalaL cere- 
monies described on pa<j;o 495 and the sun-dance ceremonies of the Sioux and Black- 
feet, but their analogy is quite striking. 



662 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

refer to what I stated previously (pp. 332, 336) in regard to the growth 
of the clan system of the Kwakiutl tribes. I pointed out that this 
system probably attained its present develoi)ment under the impetus 
of the clan system of the northern tribes; that the social distinction 
connected witli the possession of a clan legend gave a suflticient sugges- 
tion to the mind of the Indian to turn his imagination in this direction, 
and that the hereditary manitou probably became the totem of the clan. 

Tlie close similarity between the clan legends and those of the acquisi- 
tion of spirits presiding over secret societies, as well as the intimate 
relation between these and the social organizations of the tribes, allow 
us to apply the same argument to the consideration of the growth of 
the secret societies, and lead us to the conclusion that the same psy- 
chical factor that molded the clans into their present shape molded the 
secret societies. 

If this argument is correct, we must expect that the legends of the 
secret societies, although belonging to the most sacred myths of 
the tribes, show indications of foreign intiuences, as these nnist have 
offered the material for the suggestions which gave rise to the myths. 
I will not at this place enter into a detailed discussion of these tradi- 
tions as I have done so in another publication.' I have shown that 
all legends of this region are of complex origin, and that they must 
have been carried over enormous distances from tribe to tribe. This is 
true as well of the more insigniticant tales as of the most important 
myths, such as creation legends, and the legends of the origin of the 
secret societies. To give only one or two examples: In the tale of the 
origin of the cannibal society of the He'iltsuq (p. 401), it is told how a 
woinan gave birth to a number of dogs, who attained the secrets of the 
cannibal society. This tale is found over the whole of the northwestern 
portion of Korth America, among all the Athapascan tribes, among 
the Eskimo, and all along the Korth Pacific Coast. Only in this sin- 
gle instance is it connected with the origin of the secret societies, and I 
conclude, therefore, that a foreign story has been embodied in this myth. 

While here the foreign portion of the myth forms only a slightly 
connected incident of the tale, foreign material is much more closely 
interwoven with the whole labric in the most important one of all 
the legends of secret societies, viz, the tale of BaxbakuillanuXsI'wac.- 
When we compare this myth with the creation myth of the Chinook' 
we find a remarkable resemblance in certain parts of the legends. 
The grandmother of the divinity of the Chinook, when a <;liild, was car- 
ried away by a monster. Their child became the mother of the culture 
hero, and by her help the monster was slain. Among the Kwakiutl, the 
cannibal spirit carries away a girl, and is finally slain by her help. 
In one version, their child becomes the new cannibal spirit. There 
exist several stories on the west coast of Vancouver Island which form 

' " Indianische Sagen von der Nord-Pacifischen Kiiste Amerikas," Berlin, 189.5, p. 
329.

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 663 

probably the connecting links between these two legends. Further- 
more, the important incident of the magic liiglit whicili figures in the 
Kwakiutl legend (p. 400) has so wide a distribution, not only on the 
Pacific Coast but also iu the Old World, that we must consider it a 
foreign element in this myth.' 

These instances show tliat the myths referring to the ceremonial are 
of complex origin. 

I will point out another peculiarity of these traditions: When we 
compare the legends as told by the various tribes of the coast, we find 
that the ceremonial is derived from a variety of myths. Some men 
obtained it from BaxbakualanuXsi'wae, others from the wolves, still 
others brought it down from heaven. The legend of the Tsimshian tells 
that a hunter obtained it from a bear who took him into his lodge in 
the interior of a rock (p. 652). Traditions which are entirely distinct 
iu character and origin are brought forward to explain the origin of 
the same ceremonial. 

What does this prove ? We have seen that none of the tales referred 
to can be considered as a growth of the genius of any of these tribes 
uninfluenced by any foreign sources. All the traditions are full of for- 
eign elements which can be traced, step by step, to distant regions. 
When we see, therefore, that the same ritual is explained by a variety 
of traditions, we must conclude that in this region at least the ritual is 
older than the tradition referring to the ritual; that the former must be 
considered as primary, the latter as secondary. 

I believe the source of the ritual, as well as of the legends which are 
connected with it, must be looked for in the advantages and the pre- 
rogatives wliich the membership of secret societies gives. This must 
have caused a desire to possess such membership, which either led 
men to acquire memberships in existing societies, or, where these were 
not sufficient, for the people to invent new ones. Of course, I do not 
mean to say that the Indian invented traditions consciously and 
intentionally, but that the desire excited his fancy and his whole state 
of mind, and that in this manner, after appropriate foisting, the oppor- 
tunity was given for hallucinations, the material for which was neces- 
sarily taken from the existing ideas, or from the ideas of neighboring 
tribes. These are the peculiar phenomena which were set forth by 
Stoll in his book on Suggestion, and I think iu a deeper manner by 
Tarde in his book on the Laws of Imitation. 

It is easily understood how the exciting aspect of the ceremonial of 
the cannibal society caused a young man who had gone fasting to 
believe that he saw in his hallucinations the same spirit under new 
conditions, and to tell of his experience after his return. As the 
notion had become established that the spirit, after having been seen, 
had a tendency to reappear to the descendants, an opportunity was 
given for the formation of a new place in the secret society. We may

River, see "Globus/' LXXI, page 92. 



664 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

therefore assume tliat the psychological explanation for the develop- 
ment of the complicated system of the membership in secret societies 
lies in the combined action of the social system on the one hand and 
the method of acquiring manitous on the other. 

While these considerations explain the variety of forms of the secret 
societies and prove that the myths on which the ritual is apparently 
founded are probably secondary in character, they do not give a clew 
to the origin of the secret societies and of the peculiar customs con- 
nected with them. There are, however, indications which allow us to 
conclude that these customs had their origin in methods of warfare. 
First of all, the deity Wlua'lag-ilis is considered the bringer of the cere- 
monial. This name means "the one who makes war upon the whole 
world," and he rules the mind of man at the time of war as well as 
during the period of activity of the secret societies. For this reason, 
also, the secret societies are in action during times of war, in winter as 
well as in summer (see p. 429). All the oldest songs of these socie- 
ties have reference to war; the cannibal, the bear dancer, and the 
fool dancer, are considered as chief warriors, and fall into ecstasies as 
soon as they have killed an enemy. All this seems to indicate that 
the origin of the secret societies has a close connection with warfare. 

But one thing more must be considered. The customs which we 
observe nowadays are evidently a modern development of more ancient 
forms. The ceremonial of cannibalism, which nowadays is the most 
important part of the whole ceremonial, is known to have been intro- 
duced among the various tribes recently, although its foundation, the 
idea of the existence of a spirit who is killing people, is present among 
all the tribes. The Kwakiutl state uniformly that the custom of 
devouring men was introduced among their tribe about sixty years 
ago, and that it was derived from the He'iltsuq. We also have 
conclusive evidence that the custom was acquired by the Tsimshian 
not more than seventy years ago, and that they also obtained it 
from the Hc/iltsuq. Therefore there is no doubt that the custom origi- 
nally was confined to the small territory of the Hc/iltsuq. Among the 
southern tribes the action of the cannibal was confined to his taking 
hold with his teeth of the heads of enemies, which were cut off in war. 

The form in which the ceremony of cannibalism of the He'iltsuq 
appeared first was the following: A slave was killed by his owner, and 
then was torn and eaten by the cannibals, or pieces of flesh were torn 
with the teeth from the arms or the chest of people, or, finally, corpses 
which were prepared in a j^articular manner were devoured by the can- 
nibal. The first of these customs shows clearly its close connection 
with warfare. The slave is the booty of the cannibal or of his relatives, 
and by slaying him the victory is once more brought before the eyes of 
his admiring friends. It is hardly possible to prove definitely that the 
secret societies have developed exclusively from customs relating to 
warfare, but I believe my remarks have made clear the close connection 
between the two phenomena.

Tlie tliree part beats are syncopated, the sticks being raised at each 
qnarter and therefore falling nearly on the second eighth of the three 
part bar. The four part rhythm is syncopated in the same manner. 
The rhythm of the tune of the second line, Lats'ek-as g-anEmLe, is not 
quite certain. I counted the f of the second bar almost three eighths, 
and also in the seventh bar of this part, but there seemed to be 
throughout slight irregularities in rhythm of the first seven bars ol 
this part of the song, thougli the beating is perfectly regular, five 
eighths against three of the tune. The text as sung by my informant 
differs slightly from the dictated text,

THE CRAPHIC ART OF THl: F.SKIMOS. 



By Walteu James Hoffman, M. D., 
Honorary Curator. Ethnolot/ical Mitaciim, Catholic UnwersHy of America, Washing- 
ton, B.C. 



INTRODUCTION. 

In the selection of appropriate materials upon which to inscribe 
his thoughts, primitive man was governed to a great extent by his 
environment. 

In a country abounding in rocks and cliffs, it was but natural for 
him to portray upon a smooth conspicuous surface the record of an 
exploit, or a character to direct his companions on the right trail or 
to a convenient camping place. In that portion of the West known 
as the '• Great Plains," rock pictures are of seldom occurrence. The 
numerous tribes of many different languages were hunters of the 
buffalo, and in their frequent movements from place to place found 
the skin of that animal, as well as that of the deer, the most con- 
venient. Along the shores of the Great Lakes, where the white birch 
is of frequent occurrence, the Indians employ the bark of this tree for 
their mnemonic and other records. The bark, when fresh, is tough, 
and retains permanently the slightest markings indented or incised 
upon it by means of a sharply pointed bone or nail. 

Various Indian tribes employ, also, other substances, such as bone, 
wood, and various arrangements of shell beads, as well as feathers and 
textile substances, to convey special forms of information.^ 

The Innuit or Eskimo of Alaska utilize the tusks of the walrus, and 
in occasional instances the horns of the reindeer. The tnsks are cut 
longitudinally into rods, upon the faces of which delicate engravings 
or etchings are made, the depressions or incisions thus produced being 
filled with black or some other color so as to heighten the effect. 

The Eskimo of Greenland, Labrador, and the remaining portions of 
the Arctic regions east of the delta of the Mackenzie Eiver, use flat 
pieces of wood upon which to exercise their more primitive skill at art 
ornamentation. Although ivory is abundant in some portions of the 
Melville Peninsula, yet it appears generally absent in the collections 
from that region.

750 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

While the iiccompanying paper is based chiefly upon the collection 
in the United States l!^ational Museum, quite a number of valuable 
data were found in the interesting collection of ivory records in the 
museum of the Alaska Commercial Company in San Francisco, Cali- 
fornia. 

In addition to these two sources of information, the writer was so 
fortunate as to have the services in San Francisco of a native Alaskan 
half-caste, who had for a number of years been in the employ of the 
Commercial Company. This man had spent most of his life in travel- 
ing- among the various settlements of southern Alaska, chiefly for the 
purpose of securing furs and peltries in exchange for goods desired by 
the natives. Vladimir IS^aomofl", in addition to his thorough familiarity 
with tlie Russian and English language, was fluent in five or six native 
dialects. His keen observation of the habits of the people of the main- 
land, and their various methods of conveying information by recording 
on difterent materials their thoughts, enabled him to interpret with ease 
the numerous records in the museum referred to; and he also prepared a 
number of sketches in imitation of records which he had observed, and 
which he had been instructed to prepare and deposit at habitations at 
which he had called during the absence of the regular occupants or 
owners. 

The primary studies relating to the subject of the interpretation of 
pictograj)hs were begun by the writer in 1871 ; and but limited prog- 
ress was made until the year 1879, when the Bureau of Ethnology was 
organized and furnished the facility necessary to oflicially conduct 
investigations among the various Indian tribes of the United States 
and British Columbia, and to visit nearly all known jiictographs and 
petroglyphs in order to make personal investigations, comparisons, 
and to secure tracings and sketches thereof. 

In addition to these researches in pictography, the gesture language 
of the various tribes was also studied, the latter frequently aiding very 
materially in interpreting obscure characters, and attempts at the 
graphic portrayal of gestures and subjective ideas.' 

The collection of gesture signs obtained from Vladimir Naomoff", and 
subsequently verified, to a great extent, by a Mahlemut native from 
St. Michael's, is appended hereto,^ in connection with the list of objects 
in the National IMuseum, to which special reference is made. 

These gesture signs are of importance in the study and interpreta- 
tion of many of the Eskimo records. 

Many of these gesture signs are natural, and intelligible to most 
people who are known, on account of peculiar linguistic position, to 
have knowledge of this mode of communication because of their

inability to compreheud the oral speech of surroundiug tribes. Other 
gestures were peculiar to these natives because of the unique resources 
of their peculiar environment; and others again Avere highly interest- 
ing because of the concept being hidden in some old custom, shaman- 
istic ceremonial, or individual practice of the j)erson having recourse 
to a particular idea. 

In a number of the records will be observed outlines of the human 
figure, with hands and arms, and sometimes the lower extremities, in 
curious and apparently unnatural i)Ositions. Such portrayals are 
attempts at illustrating gesture signs pictorially, and subjective ideas 
are thus indicated — a step very much in advance of the ordinary sys- 
tem of pictography as known to and practiced by most of the Indian 
tribes. 

It is obvious, therefore, that in order to fully comprehend the inten- 
tion of a pictographic record, it is necessary to know the artist's needs, 
his environment and resources, his beliefs and shamanistic observ- 
ances, and as much of the gesture language as may be obtainable. 

From a careful study of the pictographs of the several Indian tribes 
and the numerous petroglyphs and painted records scattered over 
various portions of the United States, it is safe to assert that a com- 
parison of these with the various artistic materials of the Eskimo show 
the latter to be vastly sui^erior to the preceding, especially in faithful 
reproduction of animal forms and delicacy of artistic execution. 

The portrayal of the reindeer, in particular, serves as an illustration 
of the manner in which the Eskimo are close observers as to anatomi- 
cal peculiarities, as well as in catching the expression indicated in 
various attitudes assumed by these animals in grazing, rising, running, 
and in the positions assumed to denote alarm, fear. etc. 

In the portrayal of whales the Eskimo artist is also careful as to 
si)ecific anatomical features. The peculiar elevation at the spout or 
blowhole of the "bowhead" is especially indicated, and is character- 
istic of the species, as that part of the mammal is used to raise and 
keei:> open the elastic ''granular" salt ice for breathing holes or for 
spouting. 

The smaller whale, designated also as the California gray, the "mus- 
sel digger,'' or "devilfish," is likewise specifically indicated by a more 
pointed head and sharp flukes, and I can only call attention to the 
sharp flukes and conspicuous fins of the "killer" to illustrate the 
result of observation given to it by the native artist in endeavoring 
to show graphically the part which, to him, is a specific identification 
of the animal. 

In a few illustrations the walrus is very carefully engraved, and 
although the native result may appear uncouth and cumbersome, yet a 
comparison of the etchings with the illustration of that animal will at 
once serve to show strikingly careful imitation of the original subject. 
As to the portrayal of various other animal forms, they are, generally, 



752 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

sufficiently true to nature to admit of ready identification. The imita- 
tion of the specific construction of the kaiak and the umiak is usually 
excellent, as also the various forms of dog sledges peculiar to certain 
localities in Alaska and faithfully represented in a number of etchings. 
For the purpose of further comparison between the Eskimo portrayal 
and the manufactured vehicle, several illustrations of the latter are 
reproduced in figures. 

The Eskimo is not an expert in portraying the human form. It is 
certain that in various instances man is indicated by linear outlines or 
incisions very much in imitation of that of the Shoshonian tribes, the 
head being a mere circular spot, from which is suspended a line ter- 
minating below in two legs, and beneath the head being attached two 
lateral lines for arms. These extremities may be drawn in various 
attitudes, but apart from the attitude no further notice would be given 
to them. This forms a marked contrast as compared with the same 
idea as portrayed by various Algonkian tribes, notably so the OJibwa, 
who devote much artistic attention to the head, dress, and ornaments 
of the character intended to represent a human being. 

The peculiarity of Eskimo graphic art as compared with that of 
other peoples will be treated of farther on. The subject forms the basis 
of the present paper, and was made possible through the courtesy of 
Doctor G. Brown Goode, Director in charge of the United States 
National Museum, and my indebtedness to Professor O. T. Mason, 
Curator of Ethnology, is hereby gratefully acknowledged for his val- 
uable suggestions and for placing at my disposal every facility for the 
careful examination of specimens in his custody, not all of which, how- 
ever, were deemed of sufficient importance to illustrate, as such a pro- 
cedure would have resulted in considerable duplication. 

THE ESKIMO. 
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION. 

The Eskimauan, or Innuit,^ linguistic family occupies the greater 
portion of the coast of Arctic America, Greenland, the Aleutian 
Islands, and a small area of the Chukche Peninsida of Siberia. The 
extreme points are about 3,200 miles apart, though to follow the shores 
would necessitate a journey of 5,000 miles. 

The interior portions of the continent are occupied by various Indian 
tribes, belonging to several conspicuous linguistic families, but the 
Eskimo, under various designations, have always apparently confined 
themselves to the seashore and the country adjacent thereto, not 
exceeding 50 miles inland, except in following various river courses in. 
pursuit of game. 

The easternmost branch of the Eskimo is that represented by natives 



' Although the term Innuit is frequently employed, and m.iy he linguistically 
proper, the writer employs the more popular term, viz : Eskimo. 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 753 

along the north and east coast of Greenland, two families being met 
with by Captain Clavering in 1823, north of 74^ 30'. Captain Holm 
recently found them on the southeast coast between Goo and Gfio north 
latitude. These are said to profess ignorance of any natives north 
of them. On the west coast of Greeidand they extend to about 74° 
north latitude. General Greely found indications of permanent settle- 
ments in Grinnell Land, near Fort Conger, at 81° 44' north latitude, 
Mr. Henry G. Bryant, in his "Notes on the most northern Eskimos,"^ 
says: 

As is well known, tlie most northern Eskimos were first visited by Sir John Ross 
in 1818, and he first applied to them the term "Arctic Highlanders." As the appro- 
priateness of this appellation seems quite (luestiouable as applied to a tribe living 
wholly on the seacoast, I have preferred to use the term "most northern Eskimos," 
as being more descriptive and appropriate in its character. This tril)e inhabits that 
rugged strip of indented coast in northwest Greenland wliich extends for about 
550 miles from Cape York to a point somewhat south of the southern edge of the 
Humboldt glacier. It is a fact well known that the impassible ice walls which occur 
at both of these points have thus far served as effectual barriers to any extended 
migrations of this tribe. It is owing to this enforced isolation that at this late day 
we find here the most typical of the Eskimo family groups — a primitive tril)e who 
are but just emerging from the Stone Age, whose members still dress in skins, eat 
raw flesh, and pursue their game with the same sort of rude weapons that their 
forefathers used in prehistoric times. 

Doctor Kane, in 1855, noted this tribe as numbering 140, while 
Mr. Bryant remarks that Lieutenant Peary places the census at fully 
250. 

On the Labrador Coast the Eskimo extend southward to Hamilton 
Inlet at about 55^=^ 30', north latitude, though it is not so long since 
they were located at the Straits of Belle Isle. 

On the east coast of Hudson Bay these natives reach southward to 
James Bay; while northward it is on Ellsmere Land and around Jones 
Sound that Doctors Boas and Bessels place the northernmost groups 
of the middle Eskimo. Several of the northern Arctic islands present 
evidence of former occupancy, but for some unknown cause the natives 
migrated thence. The western part of the central region of the con- 
tinent seems unoccupied, and from the Mackenzie westward the coast 
seems to have no permanent villages between Ilerschel Island and 
Point Barrow. This strip of country is no doubt hunted over in sum- 
mer, as the natives of the latter locality do not penetrate far into the 
interh)r for game. 

The Alaskan Coast from Point Barrow to the Copper Eiver on the 
south is practically occupied by Eskimo of various villages or bands, 
as will hereafter be more fully described. 

The Aleutian Islands are occupied to a certain extent by a branch 
of the same linguistic family, though the dialects are unintelligible 
to the Eskimo proper. Their distribution has been very materially

changed since the advent of the Russians and the establishment of the 
fur trade, and at present they are located principally on a few of the 
largest islands only. 

On the Asiatic side this family is represented by the Yiiit, who are 
distinct from the Chuhche, or Tuski of authors, who are of Asiatic 
origin, and of a distinct linguistic grouj). The Ytiit are also a coast 
people, and, according to Mr. Dall, are comparatively recent arrivals 
from the American side. Between the Siberian and the Alaskan 
coasts are the Diomede Islands, a convenient stopping place for voy- 
agers between the two continental points above mentioned. At these 
islands Simeon Deshneff", in 1648, found natives wearing labrets who 
were at war with the Tiiski. Similar reports were made by Shestakoff, 
in 1730. Peter Popott', who visited the Asiatic mainland about 1711 
for the purpose of collecting tribute from the Chukche, describes the 
habitations and remarks that "he found among the Tiiski ten of the 
islanders wearing labrets, who had been taken prisoners of war."' 

Mr. DalP observes that the Tiiski do not wear labrets, which 
distinguishing feature, compared with the Chukche, was noticed by 
Deshnefl', as well as all subsequent voyagers. Both sexes tattoo, not 
only over the face but all over the body. The women in jirobably all 
instances bear tattooed vertical lines on the chin, a practice which is 
not followed by the men. An illustration of tattooing upon the chin 
of a Port Clarence woman is given elsewhere. 

Concerning the representatives of the Eskimo upon the Asiatic side 
of Bering Strait, the following remarks are rej)roduced from the memo- 
randa concerning " the Arctic Eskimos in Alaska and Siberia," by 
John W. Kelly,^ interpreter, who says of the "Siberian Eskimos:" 

There are .settlemeuts of Eskimos at Cape Tchapliu (Indian Point), Plover Bay, 
and East Cape. How long they have been there and how much of the country they 
have occupied can only he conjectured. Those occupying St. Lawrence Island, Cape 
Tchaplin, and part of the shores of Plover Bay, on the mainland of Asia, opposite 
St. Lawrence Island, speak a dialect nearer like that of Point Bariow or the Mac- 
kenzie River than the dialects of the Dioniedes or Kotzebue Sound. That the 
Eskimos of Asia have l)een there a great many years is a certainty. The Deermen 
people, whose principal support is domesticated reindeer, have gradually crowded 
out the Eskimo or Fishmen, and have almost absorbed them by assimilation. They 
wear no labrets, and in dress and tattooing are the same as the Deermen. That 
they have lived in underground houses is abundantly proved by the ruins at Cape 
Tchaplin of old huts which have been framed with the whole jaws of whales. Now 
they live in huts above ground, covered with walrus hides. They are built in the 
same manner as those of the Deermen, who use a covering of reindeer robes. From 
tlie Deermen they have also learned to cremate their dead, instead of scattering the 
bodies over the plain, according to the custom of the American Eskimos. Like the 
American Eskimos, they deposit the personal property of the deceased at his grave. 
If he was a great hunter, they also erect a monument of reindeer antlers over his

grave. At East Cape, Siberia, tlmre is a trace of the Arctic Eskimos, but differing 
from their nearest neighbors, the Diomedo people. 

In the vicinity of East Cape there are a few ruins of underground houses, and a 
few Eskimo words are still used by the jieople. Twenty miles westward from Cape 
Tchaplin is Plover Bay, where both the Eskimo and Deermen language is spoken, 
but the Eskimo is on a rapid decline. 

SUBTEIBES OR SETTLEMENTS. 

The Eskimo of littoral Alaska are divided into a considerable num- 
ber of geograpliic divisions, popularly designated as tribes, and are 
here briefly enumerated chiefly according to W. H. Ball's arrangement, 
his orthography being generally maintained. 

The accompanying map of Alaskan and Asiatic coasts will serve to 
further aid in locating the points occupied by the various native settle- 
ments below enumerated. Plate 1. 

The Aleutians, properly so called, are divided into two tribes, the 
Atkans and Unalashkans. The former belong to the western part of 
the archipelago, and the latter were originally confined to the eastern 
portion. The original name of these people signified, according to 
Humboldt, "People of the East," and they have been regarded as 
having originally come from the continent, a reference to which theory 
will be made further on. 

The Ugalakmut [=Aigaluxamiut]' is the southernmost tribe, begin- 
ning nearly at the mouth of the Coi)per Eiver and extend westward to 
Icy Bay. Some of the eastern bands have become mixed by inter- 
marriage with the Thlinkit. "The Chugjichmuts occupy the shores 
and islands of Ohugach.Gulf, and the southwest coasts of the penin- 
sula of Kenai." They are few in number, compared with the large 
extent of country they occupy. 

The Kaniagmuts occupy the island of Kadiak and the greater por- 
tion of the peninsula of Aliaska. This is probably the most poi^ular of 
all the Eskimo tribes. They extend from Lliamna Lake to 159° west 
longitude. 

The Oglemuts occupy the Aliaska peninsula along the northern coast, 
from ir)9° west longitude to the head of Bristol Bay, and along the 
north shore of that bay to Point f]tolin. 

The Kiateqamiut inhabit the coast from near the mouth of Nushergak 
River westward to Cape ISTewenham. They are the IsTushergagmnts of 
Ball, who remarks of them as particularly excelling in carving ivory, 
and that most of their weapons and tools are made of this material. 

The Kuskwoginuts "inhabit both shores of Kuskoqiiim Bay, and 
some little distance up that river," 

The Agulmuts extend "from near Cape Avenoff nearly to Cape 
Eomanzofl". There are also a number of settlements of the same tribe 
on the island of Nunivak." 



' All words, or remarks, within brackets are added by the present writer. 



756 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The Miigemiits " iiiliabit the vicinity of Cape Eoiui'inzoflf, and reach 
nearly to the mouth of the Yukon. They resemble their southern 
neighbors more than they do those to the north of them. The women 
wear labrets. The name Magemut signifies '■ Mink peoide.'" 

The Ekogmuts " inhabit the Yukon delta from Kipniuk to Pastolik, 
and ascend the river as far as Mauki, some distance above the mission- 
Those who inhabit the Kwikhpak slough call themselves Kwikhpagmut, 
a name sometimes applied to the whole tribe." A peculiarity " in many 
of them is the extreme hairiness of their persons. Many of tliem have 
very strong black beards and hairy bodies." 

The Unaligmuts, or Unaleet, " occuj^y the coast from Pastolik to 
Shaktolik." They have also been designated as the Azi;igmut. 

The Miihlemuts ^^ occupy the coast of Norton Sound and ]>ay north 
of Shaktolik and the neck of the Kavidk Peninsula to Selawik Lake. 
Their most eastern village is Attenmut, and their western boundary 
the river which flows northward into Spavariefif Bay, Kotzebue Sound." 

The Kaviiigmiuts occupy the Kaviak Peninsula and Sledge or Aziak 
Island. " Many of them pass the winter in the southern part of Nor- 
ton Sound, and tliere is a large Kaviak village at Unalaklik. * * * 
Their jirincipal villages are Nookmut, at Port Clarence, and Knik- 
T.igmut, on Golofnina Bay." 

The portrait of a Kaviiigmiut man, aged 33 years, is given in plate 2. 
He is a very intelligent native, and is a clever artisan. Another type 
of the same tribe is shown in the person of Suku'ut, aged 25 years, 
from the same locality, plate 3. An interesting illustration of a girl 
aged 17 years is presented in plate 4. She has a remarkably clear skin, 
pink cheeks, and bears upon her chin the usual pattern of tattooed 
lines, extending downward from the mouth. 

In plate 5 is reproduced the portrait of an inhabitant of the village 
of Kuwuk, at Point Barrow. The features are very much less i^leasing 
than those shown in the preceding figures. Plate 6 represents a young 
man from the village of Utkiavwin.^ 

The Oke ogmuts are essentially the same as the preceding, but the 
name is applied " by the Innuit to the small and energetic tribe who 
inhabit the islands by Bering Strait. They carry on the trade between 
the two continents, and visit the island of St. Michael every yeai for 
the purpose. I have also heard the same name applied to the inhab- 
itants of St. Lawrence Island." 

The Eskimo of the Point Barrow region are located, according to Mr. 
Murdoch, =^ in the villages of Nuwuk and Utkiavwiii. Nuwfik signifies 
" the Point," and is a slightly elevated knoll at the extremity of Point 
Barrow, in latitude 71° 23' north, longitude 156o 17' west. Utkiavwin 
signifies " the Cliffs," is 11 miles west from Nuwuk, at Cape Smyth, 
and is also a high ridge. The nearest neighbors to the east are those

at Herscliel Island, or Demarcation Point, and on the west at a small 
village between Point Belcher and Wainriglit Tnlet. The natives of 
these villages are so closely connected, says Mr. Murdoch, "that they 
are sometimes spoken of collectively as Sidarunminm'' (= Sidarnnmiut). 
"At a distance up the river, which flows into Wainright Inlet, live the 
Kunmiun, ' the people who- live on the river.' These appear to be 
closely related to the lirst village below Wainright Inlet, which is 
named Kilauwitawin." ' 

The people at Point Hope, according to Mr. Murdoch, are known as 
the Tikera'umiun, "inhabitants of the foreftiiger (Point Hope)." 

The natives along the coast east of Point Barrow to and beyond the 
Mackenzie are often spoken of by the Hudson Bay traders as the Mac- 
kenzie Eiver Eskimo. They appear to be identical with those described 
by Father Petitot as the Ta/jcopmeut [=Ta|eo meut] division of the 
Tchiglit, and are termed by Murdoch the Kupfmmiun, and inhabit the 
permanent villages at the " western mouth of the Mackenzie, at Shingle 
Point and Point Sabine, with an outlying village, supposed to be 
deserted, at Point Kay." Still another tribe is located at Anderson 
River and Cape Bathurst, not considered by Petitot as the above 
named, as he applies the name Kpagmalit. Sir John Richardson, the 
first to meet with them [182G], calls them " Kette-garrce-oot." ^ 

POPULATION. 

With reference to the population of the Eskimo of the several divi- 
sions, only approximate figures can be given. The Greenland groui), 
consisting of seventeen villages on the east coast, are stated by Holm, 
in 1884-85, to number about 550, while on the west coast the "mission 
Eskimo" numbered 10,122 in 188G, and the northern Greenland Eskimo, 
or Arctic Highlanders of Ross, number about 200. 

])octor Boas estimates the "Central or Baffin Laud Eskimo" at 
about 1,100. 

The natives along the coast in Labrador are stated by Rink, Packard, 
and others, to number about 2,000 souls.-^ 

The Alaskan Eskimo, comprising those of the mainland, as well as 
the few (40?) upon Little Diomede Island, together with those on St. 
Lawrence Island and the Aleutian Islanders, are estimated by Dall 
and others at about 20,000.' 

This, excepting the Siberian tribe, makes a total of about 34,000 
Eskimo. What the former population, before the introduction of liquor 
and social vices, may have been it is impossible to conjecture. It is 
stated by one author (Dall) that the Aleutians formerly were estimated 
at 20,000, but recently numbered only 1,500, which figure has also been 
given by others, though according to a still later estimate these 
islanders were put down at 2,200.

758 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

EARLY EXPLORATIONS. 

For reasons wliich will hereafter become evident, it is necessary to 
refer briefly to the several explorations made to eastern Siberia, and 
later to the American mainland. In the following historical references 
I use freely Mr. Ball's remarks, published in his work, "Alaska and 
its Eesources," of which note has before been made. 

In the year 1640, the Eussiaus, under Isai Ignatief, pushed their 
exj^lorations to the east of the Kolyma Eiver, the mouth of which is at 
about latitude 09° 30' north and longitude 1G1° 30' east, and obtained 
by barter from some Chukche specimens of walrus ivory. In the follow- 
ing year, 1647, four small vessels sailed eastward of Kolyma, the party 
being under the command of a Cossack, named Simeon Deshneff. The 
object of this expedition was to reach the Anadyr Eiver, of which vague 
reports had been received. Other explorers followed, but it was not 
until 1648 that the northeast coast of Asia was passed and Bering Sea 
entered. 

Various explorers continued, from year to year, to visit difterent por- 
tions of the coast of Kamchatka, but it was not until 1711 that a Cos- 
sack, named Peter Iliiinsen Popoff, arrived at East Cape with the 
intention of collecting tribute from the Chukche. The visit proved 
fruitless, but Popoif retiwned with an account of the Diomede Island- 
ers and the Chukche account of a continent which lay to the east and 
beyond these islands. 

On account of the interest manifested in these discoveries, scientific 
men succeeded in obtaining the attention of Peter the Great, and 
instructions for an expedition were delivered to Admiral Apraxin. A 
few days later the Emperor died, but the Empress, in order to fulfill the 
wishes of the deceased monarch, ordered the execution of the instruc- 
tions, and Captain Vitus Bering was nominated to command the exjie- 
dition. Although the original plan Avas formulated in 1725, it was not 
until 1727 that Bering and his companions left St. Petersburg. He 
sailed past what is now known as St. Lawrence Island, through Bering 
Strait, and, thus proving the separation of Asia and America, returned 
to the Kamchatka Eiver on the 20th of September without having seen 
either the Diomede Islands or the American Coast. He returned to 
St. Petersburg in 1730, but again went on a voyage of discovery and 
landed on Bering Island, where he died December 8, 1741. 

In the meantime various other navigators and explorers had been 
making considerable progress in exploring the shores of Kamchatka 
and approaching the American Coast. In 1731 Pavlutski reached Cape 
SerdzeKaman, in the hope of securing from the Chukche some tribute. 
This resulted in failure, and in the interim Gwosdeff sailed to the 
Chukche Coast; a gale drove him eastward, "where they found an 
island, and beyond it the shores of the continent of America. They met 
a native in a Kyak, and sailed two days along the coast without being 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 759 

able to land. A storm came u\) and they returned to Kamchatka. 
This completed the exploration of Bering- Strait, which had been com- 
menced by Deshneff and his comj)anions." ^ 

It was not until July, 1741, that Chirikolt" arrived off the American 
Coast, near Cross Sound. Boats were sent there upon two occasions, 
and several days later two canoes, filled with natives, came near the 
ship, but immediately fled to the shore. Various islands were seen by 
Chirikoff on his return to Kamchatka. During this visit 21 men were 
lost, de la Croyere, the naturalist, dying of scurvy. 

r.ering saw land on July 2, and anchored near an island two days 
later. 

p]milian Bassoff discovered the island of Attn, the westernmost of 
the Aleutian group, in 1745. Glotloff' discovered the island of Kadiak, 
or Kaniag as it was designated by some of the natives, in July, 1763. 
These islanders were less disposed to friendliness and gave frequent 
evidences of hostility. 

About 1764 Lieutenant Lynd was put in command of an expedition 
which was organized under the direction of the Empress Catherine. 
He did not leave Kamchatka until 1767, sailing from Ochotsk toward 
Bering Strait, passing St. Matthew and St. Lawrence islands, saw 
Diomede Island, and finally landed on the American Coast south of 
Cai^e Prince of Wales. Further explorations of the peninsula of 
Alaska was made by Krenitzin in 1768. 

Cook entered Bering Strait in August, 1778, and, on his returu,from 
a voyage northward, explored Norton Sound and Bay. On October 3 
he again touched at Unalashka, sailed for the Sandwich Islands, where 
he was killed by the natives in 1779. 

As early as 1788, Mares and Douglas, supercargoes, sailed from 
Macas to Nootka and to Cooks Inlet. The Spanish claimed the right 
to sail the Pacific on the northwest coast of America. 

In 1791 Billings and Sarycheff visited Unalashka, St. Paul, St. Law- 
rence, Aziak, and the Diomedes ; also touciied on the American Coast 
near Cape Prince of Wales, and then anchored in St. Lawrence Bay 
on the Asiatic side. 

In 1793 the Empress of Russia issued an ukase authorizing the 
introduction of missionaries into the American colonies, and to the 
works of these patient laborers we are indebted for many interesting 
and valuable facts respecting the history of the customs and manners 
of that time. It is singular, however, that although their accounts 
often appear unusually concise and comprehensive, the practice of 
engraving upon ivory and bone, seems to have been entirely over- 
looked, or more likely may not have been in vogue among them. This 
subject, however, will be further treated elsewhere. 

The natives of Point Barrow are said never to have seen a white 
man until the year 1826, when the barge of the Blossom, under Captain 

' Dall. "Alaska and its inhabitants," p. 299. 



760 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Beechey, visited tlieir coast. They had, however, received from south- 
ern neighbors articles of European manufacture introduced by the 
Eussians, such as tobacco, copper, and other articles, some of which 
were obtained, according to Murdoch's statement,^ by way of the 
Diomede Islands and Siberia. 

Visits by other navigators were made at long intervals, and it was 
not till 1854 that the first whaling vessel came to the Point. 

Although the Point Barrow natives are provided with firearms, they 
would be unable, by means of these alone, to obtain any seals, " as 
their own appliances for sealing are much better than any civilized con- 
trivances.'' ' Mr. Murdoch, whom I have here quoted, states furthermore 
that "all are now rich in iron, civilized tools, canvas and wreck wood, 
and in this respect their condition is imf)roved." Nevertheless, in so far 
as the graphic art is concerned, they appear to be considerably behind 
the natives of Bristol Bay and Norton Sound. 

The eminent Danish antiquarian, Doctor Henry Eink,- in his remarks 
on the i^robable origin of the Eskimo, speaks of their former location 
in Greenland as follows : 

According to the sagas of the Icelanders, they were already met with on the east 
coast of Greenland about the year 1000, and almost at the same time on the east coast 
of the American continent. Between the years 1000 and 1300, they do not seem to 
have occupied the land south of 65° north latitude, on the west coast of Greenland, 
where the Scandinavian colonies wei'e then situated. But the colonists seem to 
have been aware of their existence in higher latitudes and to have lived in fear of 
an attack by them, since, in the year 12(5(5, an expedition was sent out for the pur 
pose of exiiloriug the abodes of the Skradings, as they were called by the colonists. 
In 1379 the northernmost settlement was attacked by them, eighteen men being 
killed and two boys carried olf as prisoners. About the year 14.50 the last accounts 
were received from the colonies, and the way to Greenlaml was entirely forgotten 
in the northern country. 

Doctor Eink says that the Eskimos of southern Greenland present 
features indicating "mixed descent from Scandinavians and Eskimo," 
the former, however, not Imving left any sign of influence of their cul- 
ture or nationality upon the present natives. 

In 1585 Greenland was discovered anew, by John Davis, who found 
it inhabited exclusively by Eskimo. 

In the work before cited,^ Doctor Henry Eink remarks: 

Recent iuA^estigations have revealed differences between the Eskimo tribes which 
indicate that, after having taken their first step to being an exclusively maritime 
people, they have still during their migrations been subjected to further develop- 
ment in the same direction, aiming at adapting them especially for the Arctic coasts 
as their proper home. The further we go back 'toward their supposed original 
country, the more of what may be considered their original habits we find still pre- 
served. In the general history of culture these variations must certainly appear 
trilling, but still I believe that a closer examination of them will throw light on the 
question how the most desolate and deterring regions of the globe could become

peopled. The solution of this problem is facilitated by the fact that the whole 
Eskimo natiou has been less exi^osed to that contact with other peoples which else- 
where renders such investigations more complicated. These A'ariations are among 
the Eskimo more exclusively due to natural influences to which the wanderers were 
exposed during their struggle lor existence, and which partly gave rise to new inven- 
tions, partly led only to the abolishment of i'ormer habits. In some instances also 
these external inlluences evidently occasioned decay where the severity of the 
climate in connection with the isolation and the fewness of inhabitants almost 
exceeded the bounds of human endurance. 

Doctor Rink endeavors to show from this point of view "the peculiar- 
ities of the tribes in tlie different domains of culture agree with the 
supposition that the original Eskimo inhabited the interior of Alaska; 
that apart from the true Eskimo a side branch of them in the farthest 
remote period peopled the Aleutian Islands, whereas people of the 
principal race later settled at the river mouths, spreading north- 
ward along Bering Strait and, hiving off some colonies to the opposite 
shore, proceeded around Point Barrow to the east, the Mackenzie River, 
over the central regions or Arctic Archipelago, and finally to Labrador 
and Grreenland. This dispersion may have taken thousands of years; 
they can only have proceeded in small bands, very much as still they 
are used to move about during certain seasons. Their only way of 
procuring subsistence in the vast deserts they passed over, excluded 
the possibility of national migrations on a larger scale. While in this 
way they continued to discover new countries, some fiimilies were 
induced to go farther; others remained and finally gave rise to the 
present scattered settlements. But, in proposing this hypothesis, 1 con- 
sider it a matter of course that Alaska as the original home of the 
Eskimo is not to be taken in the strictest sense, absolutely excluding 
adjacent parts of the continent toward the east. But as to the other 
theory, that the Eskimo should have emigrated from Asia by way of 
Bering Strait and found the Indian territory already occupied by the 
same natives as now, this objection must be separately taken into con- 
sideration in connection with the facts bearing in fsivor of the former." 

SHELL HEAPS IN THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS. 

The only important researches regarding i)rehistoric remains in 
Alaska and the Aleutian Islands are those of Mr. Dall.' He remarks 
that the "shell heaps are found on nearly all the islands of the 
Aleutian group. They are most abundant and extensive in the 
islands east of Unalashka, and on the few islands from Amchitka east- 
ward, which are less high and rugged than the others, or on those 
where the greater amount of level land is to be found. The two neces- 
saries for a settlement appear to have been a stream of water or a 
spring, and a place where canoes could land with safety in rough

American Ethnology, I, 1877, p. 43. 



762 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

weather. Where these are both wanting, shell heaps are never found, 
and rarely when either is absent." 

From careful examinations made by Mr. Dall, he deems it proba- 
ble that the islands "were ])opulated at a very distant period; that the 
population entered the chain from the eastward; that they were, when 
first settled on the islands, in a very different condition from that in 
which they were found by the first civilized travelers," etc. It is 
furthermore suggested by this writer that there was a later wave of 
population; that the former people "were more similar to the lowest 
grades of Innuit (so-called Eskimo) than to the Aleuts of the historic 
period," and that the stratification of the shell heaps shows a tolerably 
uniform division into three stages, characterized by the food which 
formed their staple of subsistence and by the weapons for obtaining 
as well as the utensils for preparing the food. 

The stages are — 
I. The littoral period, represented by the Echinus layer. 
II. The fishing period, represented by the Fishbone layer. 

III. The hunting period, represented by the Mammalian layer. 

In concluding his impressions respecting the shell heaps, the author 
concludes by saying " that those strata correspond approximately to 
actual stages in the development of the population which formed them, 
so that their contents may approximately, within limits, be taken as 
indicative of the condition of that population at the times when the 
respective strata were being deposited." 

PREHISTORIC ART. 

With reference to specimens of art or ornament, Mr. Dall ' remarks : 

The expression of ;estlietic' feeling, as indicated by attempts at orniimentation of 
ntensils or weapons or by the fabrication of articles wliich serve only for purposes 
of adornment, is remarkably absent in the contents of the shell heaps. As a whole, 
this feeling became developed only at the period directly anterior to the historic 
period. It was doubtless exhibited in numerous ways, of which no preservation 
was possible, so that the early record, even for a considerable period, would be very 
incomplete. We know that great taste and delicate handiwork were (expended on 
articles of clothing and manufactures of grass fiber, which would be entirely 
destroyed in the shell heaps, and of which only fragmentary remains have been 
preserved on the mummies found in the latest prehistoric burial caves and rock 
shelters. « * * 

There are some articles used on the kyak which are usually made of bone, and 
often preserved in the upper mammalian stratum, and upon which some attempts at 
ornamentation were bestowed. These are little ]>ieces of bone or ivory, in general 
shape resembling a kneeling figure, with one or two holes, through which cords are 
passed. ^ * * f he latter were in some cases carved to represent figures of ani- 
mals. Another species of ornamentation is elsewhere alluded to in the flat thin 
strips of bone which were fastened to the wooden visor worn in hunting. These 
were frequently ornamented with typically Innuit patterns of parallel lines, dots, 
concentric circles, with zigzag markings between them and radiating lines. All

American Ethnology, I, 1877, p. 43.

these were in black, on the white basis of the bone or ivory. * * * The mark- 
ings can seldom be accurately described as marks of ownership. I have never seen 
any definite mark or ornament of this nature among the Aleuts or Western lunuits. 
They readily recognize their own utensils or weapons without any such aid, and I 
believe the theory of "marks of ownership," "batons of command," and such like, 
has been stretched far beyond the point of endurance or accuracy, at least among 
writers on the Innuit. Drawings, engravings on bone or wood, and pictures of any 
kind, so far as I have observed, are all subsequent to the period covered by the 
shell heap deposit. They are invariably quite modern, though the taste for them 
is now widely sjiread among the Innuit, especially those of the regions where ivory 
is readily procured. The coloration of wooden articles with native pigments is of 
ancient origin, but all the more elaborate instances that have come to my knowledge 
have marks of comparatively recent origin. 

ESKIMO AND CAVE MEN OF FRANCE. 

In his "Alaska and its Eesources," Mr, Dall presents several illus- 
trations of drawings on bone, very ordinary specimens and limited 
to poorly executed figures of men hunting. These are given merely 
to indicate to the reader the general appearance of the etching of the 
Eskimo. It is related in this connection, however, that these drawings 
are analogous to those discovered in France in the caves of Dordogne. 
The numerous specimens of prehistoric art, both incised ai\d carved, 
which have been given by Messrs. Lartet and Christy in their work 
entitled Eeliquite Aquitanicie,^ are familiar to most archaeologists, so 
that no reproduction of plates or illnstrations is deemed necessary in 
the present instance. 

Mr. W. Boyd Dawkins,- an acknowledged authority on the antiquity 
of man in Europe, remarks at length upon the possible and in fact 
probable identification between the cave men and the Eskimo. In his 
conclusions upon comparisons between the respective arts, forms of 
weapons, apparently similar modes of living, etc., he says : 

On passing in review the manners and customs of all the savage tribes known to 
modern ethnology, there is only one people with whom the cave men are intimately 
connected in their manners and customs, in their art, and in their ^nplements and 
weapons. The Eskimo range at the present time from Greenland on the east along 
the shores of tlie Arctic Sea as far to the west as the Straits of Bering, inhabiting a 
narrow littoral strip of country, and living by hunting, fishing, and fowling. The 
most astonishing bond of uijion between the cave men and the Eskimo is the art of 
representing animals. .Just as the former engraved bisons, horses, mammoths, and 
other creatures familiar to them, so do the latter represent the animals upon which 
they depend for food. On the implements of the one you see the hunting of the urns 
and the liorse dejjicted in the same way as the killing of the reindeer and walrus on 
the implements of the other. » * * All these points of connection between the 
cave men and the Eskimo can, in my opinion, be explained only on the hypothesis 
that they belong to the same race. To the objection that savage tribes living under 
the same conditions might independeutlj* invent the same implements, and that 
therefore the correspondence in the question does not necessarily imply a unity of 
race, the answer may be made that there are no savage tribes known which use the 
same set of implements without being connected by blood. The ruder and more

764 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

common iustruments, such as flakes, and in a lesser degree scrapers, are of little value 
in classification; but where a whole set agrees, intended for various use, and some of 
them rising above the most common wants of savage life, the argument as to race is 
of considerable weight. It is still further strengthened by the identity of art. The 
articles found in the caves of Britain, Belgium, France, or Switzerland difter scarcely 
more from those used in west Georgia than the latter from those of Greenland or 
Melville Peninsula. 

From these considerations it may be gathered that the Eskimos are probably the 
rejjresentatives of the cave men, and protecteil witliin the Arctic Circle from those 
causes by which they have been driven from Europe and Asia. They stand at the 
present day wholly apart from all other living races, and are cut oft' from all both 
by the philologer and the craniolog ist. Unaccustomed to war themselves, they were 
probably driven from Europe and Asia by other tribes in the same manner as within 
the last century they have been driven farther north by the attacks of the Red 
Indian. 

The theory that the peoples of the circumpolar regions might be the 
descendants of the ancient cave dwellers of France has been enter- 
tained not only by Mr. Da^ykins. Among other arguments employed 
are (1) the apparent similarity of environment, and that as the south- 
ernmost margins of the receding ice, in glacial times, slowly moved 
northward, the ancient cave people continued their migration in that 
direction until their present location was reached; (2) the general 
resemblance in the carved weapons and utensils of reindeer horn, and 
also some of the portrayals of animal forms which occur thereon. 

From evidence based npon investigations by Doctor Kink, and the 
archieologic indications noted by Mr. Dall and others, the Eskimo 
are believed to have become a littoral people in America by expulsion 
from some interior regions of North America, such expulsion having 
been brought about through the northward expansion of the Athabas- 
can tribes toward the northwest and the Algonkian tribes toward the 
northeast. Even within historic times the ICskimo occupied a much 
more extensive coast line soutliward on the Atlantic than at present, 
and it is impossible to conjecture what may not have been the southern 
limits, in prflliistoric times, with reference to the first theory above 
named. 

It is believed by some geologists that as the glaciers of western 
Europe gradually receded, the direction of migration of the prehistoric 
peoijle was toward the British Isles, the Scandinavian Peninsula, and 
Lapland. The theory of their passage across to Greenland does not 
appear to be supported by any prehistoric remains, such as one would 
hope to discover after the recovery of the great amount of excellent 
material indicating a peculiar advancement in the arts of fashioning 
weapons and utensils of ivory and horn. Neither does tliere survive 
anything in Greenland but the simi)lest type of artistic decoration on 
ivory or bone, such as lines, dots, etc., which is characteristic of the 
Eskimo everywhere, excepting in Alaska, where the greater develop- 
ment was due to other causes, which will be mentioned farther on. 

Neither is there apparent evidence that the Eskimo came across 
Bering Strait, as the survivors of the ancient cave men of Europe.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 765 

With regard to the second theory, it would be strange indeed if 
there were not some general similarities between the weapons and 
utensils of two distinct uncivilized peoples when both used the same 
materials — reindeer horn — for such articles; and, furthermore, the 
attempted portrayal of animals of like genera w<mld naturally produce 
j-esults of very general likeness. 

Finally, it has been suggested, and the burden of proof appears to 
indicate, that the development of pictographic art among the Alaskan 
Eskimo was attributable to their contact with the Russians; and that, 
although these natives preserved a limited degree of culture as to 
decorating by simple lines and dots their weapons and a few other arti- 
cles of daily use, yet the objective representation of any animate or 
other forms is believed to have been adopted since the earliest visits of 
civilized man to the Alaskan Coast. 

Several Alaskan utensils, however, used as arrow and spear straight- 
eners are here illustrated in plate 7, figs. 1, 2, and 3, and plate 8, figs. 
2 and 3, and are apparently similar to some like remains fiom the caves 
of France figured by Messrs. Lartet and Christy. 

Upon closer examination it will be observed that besides the simi- 
larity of form, due chiefly to the reason that both types are of similar 
materials, the representation of animal forms by engraving, or incision, 
appears to belong to a different school of artistic work, if such a term 
may here be employed; a "sketchy" outline of an animal freipiently 
consisting of but a few suggestive incisions here and there, as in very 
modern nineteenth century art work, producing an effect in several 
instances as the reindeer figured by Lartet and Christy in their work 
before cited, which artistic products appear "too artistic" for the 
culture status of cave men such as are portrayed in the deductions of 
the gentlemen above <[Uoted by W. Boyd Dawkins and others who 
have followed np the same theme. The work of the cave men is appar- 
ently vastly superior in one respect to that of the Eskimo, and again 
from another aspect inferior to it — inferior in various ways, as will be 
learned by a perusal of the results attained by the Eskimo in the rep- 
resentation of both objective and subjecitive ideas, as well as an 
advancement toward conventionalization beyond that practiced by peo- 
ples who are apparently further advanced in other respects. 

ENVIRONMENT. 

So many narratives relating to the life and social conditions of the 
Eskimo, as well as to the topographic peculiarities of the countries 
occupied by the various subdivisions of this people, have been pub- 
lished at various times and by various authorities, that anything 
farther in this connection would be superfluous, especially in a paper 
devoted more particularly to the graphic arts. 

The habitations and clothing, such as are required in an unusually 
inhospitable climate, are both illustrated in the native pictography. 



766 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Tbe forms of habitations are more particularly referred to elsewhere, 
and various native representations are reproduced for the sake of com- 
parison both as to artistic merit as well as indicating personal or tribal 
variations dependent on climatic requirements. 

The styles of clothing are not often referred to in Eskimo etchings, 
tattooing and labrets being sometimes indicated in carvings, as well 
as in incised characters. Some interesting carvings, with delicate 
artistic touches to accentuate the effects of tattooing, are given else- 
where. 

ORNAMENTS AND LABRETS. 

In some of the etchings are portrayed the outlines of human figures — 
in various attitudes, though especially as if in the act of dancing— to the 
rear portion of the body of which are attached little tail-like append- 
ages resembling tails of animals. 

This may be explained by quoting Captain Beechey,' as in his refer- 
ence to the natives found northward of Cape Prince of Wales, within 
4^ miles of Schismareff Inlet, he states that, in addition to certain 
described articles of clothing, "they have breeches and boots, the 
former made of deer's hide, the latter of seal's skin, both of which 
have drawing strings at the upper part made of seahorse hide. To 
the end of that which goes round the waist they attach a tuft of hair, 
the wing of a bird, or sometimes a fox's tail, which, dangling behind 
as tliey walk, gives them a ridiculous appearance, and may probably 
have occasioned the report of the Tschutschi, recorded in Muller, that 
the people of this country have 'tails like dogs.'" 

Among the trimmings aud ornaments attached to the clothing the 
Point Barrow Eskimo^ also attach at tlie back the tail of an animal, 
usually a wolverine's. "Very seldom a wolf's tail is worn, but nearly 
all, even the boys, have wolverine tails, which are always saved for this 
pur])ose and used for no other. The habit among tlie Eskimo of western 
America of wearing a tail at the girdle has been noticed by many 
travelers, and prevails at least as far as the Anderson Eiver," where it 
was noticed by Father Petitot, who, in describing the dress of the 
"chief," remarks "par derriere il i)ortait aux reins nne queue epaisse 
et ondoyante de renard noir.'' ^ 

Captain Beechey^ first observed lip ornaments at Schismaeff" Inlet, a 
short distance north of Cape Prince of Wales, and thence northward 
to Point Barrow, seemingly a common practice along this coast. " These 
ornaments consist of pieces of ivorj^, stone, or glass, formed with a 
double head, like a sleeve button, one part of which is thrust through 
a hole bored in the under lip. Two of these holes are cut in a slanting 
direction about half an inch below the corners of the mouth. The

incision is made when about the age of puberty, and is at first the size 
of a quill. As they grow older, the natives enlarge the orifl<;e, and 
increase the size of the ornament accordingly, that it may hold its 
place. In adults this orifice is about half an inch in diameter, and will, 
if required, distend to three-quarters of an inch." The same practice 
in every respect is also observed at Chamisso Island,' a short distance 
from the above locality, and further reference concerning the natives is 
quoted from the same authority as follows : " They readily disengaged 
these lip ornaments from their lips, sold them, without minding the 
least inconvenience of the saliva that flowed through the badly cica- 
triced orifice over the chin; but rather laughed when some of us 
betrayed disgust at the spectacle, thrusting their tongues through the 
hole and winking their eyes." 

ART FACILITY. 

Mr. Alfred C. Haddon, in his admirable work on " Evolution in Art,''^ 
remarks of the early methods of conveying information between one 
man and another, where oral or gesture language are impossible, that 
pictorial delineation must be resorted to; and further, that "probably 
one of the earliest of this needs was that of indicating ownership, and 
it maybe that many devices in primitive implements and utensils have 
this as one reason for their existence, although the nature of tlie orna- 
mentation may be owing to quite a different reason," 

It is not of rare occurrence to find upon the arrows and other i)os- 
sessions of our native Indian tribes various marks by means of which 
individual property may be identified; and among some of the pueblo 
Indians decorated pottery bears "maker's marks" in such manner that, 
although the tribe at large may not recognize the maker of any par- 
ticular decorated vessel, yet such a specimen will at once be identified 
as originating in, or with, a certain family, and when application is 
made at the designated abode, the individual will there be pointed 
out, or named if absent. 

It seems possible that the various markings upon the weapons from 
the Alaskan shell heaps may have served as " property marks," and it 
would appear, also, to have been found expedient for the native sea- 
going hunters to devise and adopt some sort of a system by means of 
which they might be enabled to identify and recover any stray or float- 
ing weapon, or the animal in which such weapon might be found, or 
possibly both. 

Mr. Haddon remarks that " the beautifying of any object is due to 
impulses which are common to all men, and have existed as far back as 
the period when men inhabited caves and hunted the reindeer and 
mammoth in western Europe." ' Apparently the oldest markings thus

used consisted of simple lines and punctures or perforations, such as 
are found at present among the Greenland and Labrador Eskimo, 
though among the latter small carvings are also beginning to be more 
abundant. 

In his referen(;e to the Kaniags, Mr. Ivan Petrofif ^ says they use 
whale spears about G feet in length, armed with slate points. '• Upon 
the point of his spear each hunter carves his mark to enable him to 
claim his quarry." 

Mr. L. M. Turner informs me that Eskimo property marks are unknown 
to him, although each hunter, or maker of weapons, will recognize his 
own workmanship, as well as that of others, by different peculiarities 
of individual skill. Among the sea-otter hunters of the Aleuts, they 
do have marks by which the detachable point of the otter spear may 
be known. " This point is often copper, obtained from copper bolts from 
a Eussiau vessel long ago stranded on their shore; and as the spear is 
made with exquisite skill, the point is also delicate and of particular 
form, so that a difficulty would arise as to whose spear point strikes 
nearest the nose of the creature. In its struggles the point is torn 
loose from the strong, yet slender, sinew line holding it to the spear. 
Another thrower may succeed in striking it and capture the otter, but 
he whose point is nearest the nose may claim the skin. A fair degree 
of liberality is usually manifested in such instances."^ 

The residence in Point Barrow of Mr. Murdoch — extending over a 
period of perhaps three years — afforded him ample opportunity to study 
the art of the Eskimo of that northernmost extremity of Alaska. In 
his report before mentioned he remarks: 

The artistic sense appears to be much more highly developed among the western 
Eskimo than among those of the east. Among the hitter, decoration appears to be 
applied almost solely to the clothing, while tools and utensils aro usually left plain, 
and if ornamented are only adorned with carving or incised lines. West of the 
Mackenzie Eiver, and especially south of Bering i-^trait, Eskimo decorative art 
reaches its highest development, as .shown by the collections in the National Museum. 
Not only is everything finished with the utmost care, but all wooden objects are 
gaily painted with various pigments, and all articles of bone and ivory are covered 
with ornamental carvings and incised lines forming conventional patterns. 

There are in the collections also many objects that appear to have been made 
simply for the pleasure of exercising the ingenuity in representing natural or fanci- 
ful objects, and are thus purely works of art. * * * As would naturally be 
expected, art at Point Barrow occupies a somewhat intermediate position between 
the highly developed art of the southwest and the simiilar art of the east. * * * 
It will l)e noticed that whenever the bone or ivory parts of weapons are decorated, 
the ornamentation is iisnally in the form of incised lines colored with red ocher or 
soot. These lines rarely represent any natural objects, but generally form rather 
elegant conventional patterns, most commonly doable or single borders, often joined 
by oblique cross lines or fringed with short pointed parallel lines. ' * * 

The only decorative work in metal is to be seen in the pipes and their accompany- 
ing i)icks and fire steel. * * *

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 769 

Mr. Dall reiniirks tliat the forms in general of the Eskimo are very 
much alike throughout the entire area occupied by this people ; but lie 
continues in another place, " Similar drawings are common everywhere 
among the Innuit, while I have never seen among the Tenneh tribes of 
the northwest any similar specimens of art." ^ 

Since the time of Mr. Ball's researches in Alaska, however, vari- 
ous specimens of Thlinkit art designs have been received by the 
National Museum. Several of these, consisting of neck ornaments, are 
reproduced in plate 9, figs. 1 to 6, and bear purely Eskimo forms of 
orii ^mentation obtained through the medium of intertribal traffic, to 
which other reference is made in connection with trade routes or culture 
'^routes. 

The ornamentation of utensils, articles of personal adornment, and of 
weapons is limited among the Eskimo eastward of Alaska to lines and 
dots in various combinations. Carvings occur also, small figures, both 
flat and in imitation of the animals with which tlie artist is familiar. 
The engraving upon ivory and bone for the purpose of recording hunt- 
ing, fishing, and other exploits and pursuits, appears to be entirely 
absent in the east, being confined to the natives of Alaska, the Siberian 
Eskimo — the Yuit — and recently copied by other neighboring peoi)les. 

In the vicinity of Chamisso Island, a short distance above Cape 
Prince of Wales, Captain Beechey^ found various kinds of utensils, 
weapons, and other manufactures of the natives, upon some of which 
were engraved various objects, to which he refers as follows : 

On the outside of tliia and other instruments there were etched a variety of figures 
of men, beasts, birds, etc., with a truth and character which showed tlie art to be 
common among them. The reindeer were generally in herds. In one picture they 
were pursued by a man in a stooping posture in snowshoes; in another he had 
apx)roached nearer to his game, and Avas in the act of drawing his bow. A third 
represented the manner of taking seals with an inflated skin of the same animal as 
a decoy; it was placed upon the ice, and not far from it was a man lying upon his 
belly with a harpoon ready to strike the animal when it should make its appearance. 
Another was dragging a seal home upon a small sledge; and several baid,ars were 
employed harpooning whales which had been previously shot with arrows; and thus, 
by comparing one with another, a little history was obtained which gave us a better 
insight into their habits than could be elicited from any signs or imitations. 

Mr. John Murdoch,^ in quoting Mr. L. M. Turner that the natives of 
Norton Sound keep a regular record of hunting and other events 
engraved upon drill bows, remarks that " we did not learn definitely 
that such was the rule at Point Barrow, but we have one bag handle 
marked with whales, which we were told indicated tlie number killed by 
the owner." Several specimens are then referred to as having figures 
incised upon them, colored both in red or in black, together witli very 
small illustrations of the bow, upon which the figures are so greatly

reduced as to be of no value in the study of pictoi^rapliic representa- 
tion of objects, ideas, or gestures. 
Mr. Murdocli ' remarks furthermore : 

The only thins^ tli:it Ave saw of the nature of numerical records were the series of 
animals engraved upon ivory, already alluded to. In most cases we were unable to 
learn whether the figures really represented an actual record or not, though the hag- 
handle already figured was said to contain the actual score of whales killed hy old 
Yii'ksma. The custom does not appear to he so prevalent as at Norton Sound. * * * 
With one exception they only record the capture of whales or reindeer. The excep- 
tion * ' * presents a series of ten boarded seals. The reindeer are usually 
depicted in a natural attitude, and some of the circumstances of the hunt are usually 
represented. For instance, a man is figured aiming with a bow and arrow toward a 
line of reindeer, indicating that such a number were taken by shooting, while a 
string of deer, represented without legs as they would appear swimming, followed, 
by a rude figure of a man in a kaiak, means that so many were lanced in the water. 
Other incidents of the excursion are also sometimes represented. On these records 
the whole is always represented by a rude figure of the tail cut off at the "small," 
and often represented as hanging from a horizontal line. 

We also brought home four engraved i)ieces of ivory, which arc nothing else than 
records of real or imaginary scenes. 

The above remarks, with the description of the four specimens else- 
where rejjrodiiced, comprise about all the attention that this interesting 
subject appears to have received during a three years' residence at 
Point Barrow among natives who suri>ass almost any other peoples in 
North America in the graphic arts. 

It is fortunate that the National Museum has in its possession the 
rich collections made by Messrs. Nelson and Turn(^r, both of whom 
appreciated the value of such material and availed themselves of the 
opportunity of securing it, as well as information pertaining to the 
interpretation of many of the pictographic ideas shown. 

In his medical and anthropological notes relating to the natives of 
Alaska, Doctor Irving C. Rosse^ remarks: 

Some I have met with show a degree of intelligence and aii^^reciation in regard to 
charts and pictures scarcely to bo expected from such a source. From walrus ivory 
they sculpture figures of birds, quadrupeds, marine animals, and even the human 
form, which display considerable individuality notwithstanding their crude delinea- 
tion and imperfect detail. * * * Evidences of decoration are sometimes seen on 
their canoes, on which are found rude pictures of walruses, etc., and they have a 
kind of picture writing by means of which they commemorate certain cA'ents in 
their lives, just as Sitting Bull has done in an autobiography thatmay beseenat the 
Army Medical Museum. 

When we were searching for the missing whales off the Siberian coast, some 
natives were come across with whom we were unable to connnunicate exce])t by 
signs, and wishing to let them know the object of our visif, a ship was drawn in :i 
notebook and shown to them with accompanying gesticulations, which they (piickly 
comprehended, and one fellow, taking the pencil and note book, drew correctly a i)air 
of reindeer horses on the ship's jib boom — a fact whicli identified lieyond doubt the 
derelict vessel they had seen. * » *

The above named antlior furthermore refers to natives raakinjji)6i^cil 
and pen-and-ink sketches, one in particular having taught himself by 
copying from the " Illustrated London ISTews." These sketches, " though 
creditable in many respects, had the defects of many Chinese pictures, 
bein-g faulty in perspective." Doctor Rosse concludes by saying: 

As these drawings eciiial those in Doctor Rink's book, done by Greenland artists, 1 
regret my inability to reproduce them here. As e\'idences of culture, they show 
more advancement than the carvings of English rustics that a clergyman has caused 
to be placed on exhibition at the Kensington J.Iuseuin. 

Doctor Henry Eink ' says : 

The art exhibited by the Alaska Eskimo in ornamenting their weapons and uten- 
sils is often mentioned in travelers' reports from the time when they were first 
visited by Europeans. To their skill in carving and engraving, we must join this 
taste displayed in the same way in making their clothing. Again, when we pass 
from Alaska to the east, we see this relish for the fine arts declining, and in western 
Greenland proofs of it have been rather scarce. But the latest expedition to the 
east coast of this country has discovered that a small isolated tribe here in the vast 
deserts of the extreme oast almost rivals the Alaska artists with respect to carving 
in bone and ornamenting their weapons and utensils. The chief difference is, that 
in Alaska, engravings illustrating human life and the animals of the country are the 
most popular objects of the artist, whereas the east Greenlanders excel in small 
reliefs representing for the most ])art animals and mythological beings grouped 
together and fastened with admirable taste and care to the surface of the wooden 
implements. 

With reference to the arts of the Eskimo of Greenland, Doctor 
Henry Eink- remarks: 

It must be noticed that though the present Greenlanders appear to have a pretty 
fair talent for drawing and writing, scarcely any traces of the arts of drawing and 
sculpture belonging to earlier times remain, with the exception of a few small 
images cut out in wood or bone, which have probably served children as play- 
things. The western Eskimo, on the other hand, displayed great skill in carving 
bone ornaments, principally on weapons and tools. 

Drawings made by Greenland Eskimo for Doctor Eink greatly 
resemble the American schoolboys' efforts. A recent production of 
precisely like character in almost every respect is from the island of 
Kolguev, and reproduced herewith in plate, together with the following 
explanation : 

Some interesting illustrations of Samoyed drawings are given by Mr. 
Aubyn Trevor- Battye in his ''Ice-bound on Kolguev," Westminster, 
1805. Kolguev Island lies 50 miles north of Arctic Europe, and is sep- 
iirated from the continent by what is known as Barent's Sea. It is 
about midway, in distance, between Waygat Island — immediately scnth 
ol Xovaya Zemblya — and the eastern extremity of Lapland. The 
Samoyeds here are entirely isolated, from the fact that they possess no 
boats that could venture 50 miles across the sea — an interesting cir-

cumstance, because they are often, from various supposed or accidental 
similarities iu customs and mauuers, coupled with the Eskimo, a people 
with whom the kayak and umiak are the chief methods of transportation. 

The illustrations represent ordinary pursuits, and appear to be made 
upon paper by means of a pencil. The peculiarities of drawing are 
very much of the same character as the Eskimo sketches obtained by 
Doctor Eink in Greenland. One example will suffice. Plate 10 repre- 
sents Samoyeds killing walrus. The black dots on the right are heads 
of seals, at which a man, lying flat upon the ice, appears to be shooting. 
The hunter appears as if placed in the air, though in reality the view 
seems to be from above — as a bird's-eye view — the figure of the man 
corresponding, in this particular, to like portrayals in several Eskimo 
engravings on ivory, from Alaska. 

Captain Parry mentions having charts made by the natives of Winter 
Island. A first attempt made " was by placing several sheets of paper 
before Iligliuk, and roughly drawing on a large scale an outline of the 
land about Eepulse Bay and Lyon Inlet, and terminating at our present 
winter quarters. * * * Iligliuk was not long in comprehending 
what we desired, and with a pencil continued the outline, making the 
land trend, as we supposed, to the northeastward. The scale being- 
large, it was necessary when she came to the end of one piece of paper 
to tack on another, till at length she had filled ten or twelve sheets, and 
had completely lost sight of Winter Island * * * at the other end 
of the table. The idea entertained from this first attempt was that we 
should find the coast indented by several inlets, and in some parts 
much loaded with ice, especially at one strait to the northward of her 
native island, Amitioke, which seemed to lead iu a direction very much 
to the westward. Within a week after this, several other charts were 
drawn by the natives in a similar way. * * * The coast was here 
delineated as before, on a very large scale, but much more in detail, 
many more islands, bays, and names being inserted. It was observ- 
able, however, that no two charts much resembled each other, and that 
the greater number of them still less resembled the truth in those parts 
of the coast with which we were well acquainted."' 

An interesting illustration of a Greenland map made by natives of 
the east coast is given by Mr. G. Holm in his Ethnographic Sketch of 
Angmagsalikerne.2 This consists of three blocks of wood, along the 
edges of which are cut various indentations and curves, leaving pro- 
jections, all of which are intended to portray the contour of the shore 
lines between various important points on the east shore of Greenland. 
Channels, capes, islands, and other topographic features are apparently 
well reproduced, at least sufficiently clear to permit of their identifica- 
tion when compared with a large chart of the locality referred to.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 773 

Mr. Alfred 0. Hadden^ says: 

All human handiwork is subject to the same operation of external forces, but the 
material on which these forces act is also infinitely varied. The diverse races and 
people of mankind have difierent ideas and ideals, unequal skill, varied material to 
work upon, and dissimilar tools to work with. Everywhere the environment is 
different. » * * 

The conclusion that forced itself upon me is that the decorative art of a people 
does to a certain extent reflect their character. A poor, miserable people have poor 
and miserable art. Even among savages leisure from the cares of life is essential for 
the culture of art. It is too often supposed that all savages are lazy and have an 
abundance of spare time, but this is by no means always the case. Savages do all 
that is necessary for life; anything extra is for excitement, a-stbetics, or religion; 
and even if there is abundance of time for these latter, it does not follow that there 
is an equivalent superfluity of energy. 

The Eskimo are a peculiarly lively people, and keenly appreciate any- 
thing ludicrous. Contrary to the Indian generally, they can enjoy a 
practical joke without thought of resenting such if personal. Such 
a condition, especially when there is an abundance of food, so that 
unoccupied time may be utilized for social enjoyment, is one which is 
apt to foster pursuits that lend gratification and pleasure to the sight 
and stimulate artistic tendencies. Shamanism prevails extensively and 
ceremonials are frequent; and apart from this there are numberless 
individual instances where natives consult the shaman for success in 
almost every avocation, and also for the exorcism of demons from the 
body of the sick, and for " hunter's medicine," i. e., securing the help 
of a shaman that game may be directed in the way of the hunter. It 
is but reasonable to presume, therefore, that the superstitions and cult 
beliefs should, to a certain degree, manifest themselves in the art, as 
well as to be the means of developing a symbolism similar in degree to 
that found among other peoples living under similar conditions and 
surrounded by like environment. 

The possible introduction into western Alaska of articles of foreign 
art or workmanshij) may thus have had but little influence uiDon the 
native Eskimo in adopting new designs and patterns, with which he 
was unfamiliar and the signification of which he did not comprehend, 
but it may have suggested to him a simplification of approaching forms 
with which he may already have been familiar. 

MATERIALS EMPLOYED. 



The material generally used by the Eskimo of Alaska is walrus ivory. 
This is both durable and sufficiently hard to retain indefinitely, with 
proper care, the most delicate etchings. Its white or cream tint forms 
a delicate background for any colored incisions, and in instances where 
from age or otherwise the material attains a yellow or orange tint, the 
black etching-like pictographs are really improved in appearance. 

' "Evolution in Art." London, 1895, pp. 7-9. 



774 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The iiuiuial wbicli funiislies this material is represented in Plate 11, 
the specimen technically known as Bosmarus ohesus, Illiger, being most 
abundant in Bristol Bay. 

The walrus tusks are capable of softening and bending, according to 
Captain Herendeen, a gentleman of considerable experience in the 
region under discussion. The tusks are divided longitudinally, one 
tusk usually furnishing four rods, either by sawing or scraping and split- 
ting. The process described below by Mr. Lucian M. Turner, as pur- 
sued in former times and with primitive tools, is still practically the 
same, though accomplished with modern tools purchased at the traders' 
or obtained from whalers. 

During his protracted residence in southern Alaska, Mr. Turner 
studied carefully the customs of the Eskimo, and for special instruction 
in some of the arts the natives Avorked in his presence, thus affording 
every opportunity desired. 

In response to my inquiry regarding the primitive methods of pre- 
paring the ivory drill bows, and their subsequent engraving with 
jnctographs, the following communication was kindly sent to me by 
Mr. Turner.^ He says: 

The abundance of walrus ivory in the days prior to the advent of Americans (the 
Russians did not encourage the use of lirearnis by the natives and stringently pro- 
hibited the sale of such weapons except in greatly favored instances) permitted the 
Innuit to secure the best character of ivory when wanted; hence the selection of a 
tusk depended entirely uj)ou the want or use to which it was to be applied. Later 
the best tusks were sold and the inferior (jualities retained, as is well shown by tbe 
comparison of the older and the more recent implements created from that material. 

The tusk selected was rudely scratched with a fragment of qu.irtz, or other sili- 
ceous stone, along the length of the tusk until the sharp edge would no longer deejien 
the groove; the other three sides were scratched or channeled until the pieces of 
tusk could be separated. .Sometimes this was done by jiressure of the hand, or 
effected by means of a kuifeblade-shaped piece of wood, on which was struck a sharp 
blow, and so skillfully dealt as not to shatter or fracture the piece intended for use. 
The other side, or slabs, were removed in a similar manner. 

The piece intended for drill bow or other use was now scraped (rubbeil) with a 
fragment of freshly broken basalt, in which the cavities formed additional cutting 
edges and aided in the collection of the bone dust. When this was explained to me, 
I suggested the use of water, but the native (Innuit) smiled and continued his 
work. I soon saw he knew better than I how to reduce the size of a strip of walrus 
ivory. This attrition of the surface was continued until tbe apjiroximate size was 
reached. The holes or perforations in the ends were produced by means of stime 
drills after a depression had been made by an angular piece of stone, any stone 
capable of wearing away the ivory substance. A few grains of sand were put into 
the shallow cavity and the stoue drill started by means of another drill or by a 
string or thong similar to the manner in making fire. 

Various sizes of stoue drills were made, and by their use the different holes were 
produced. It is unusual to find two perforations of the same diameter in any object. 
These stone drills were used in making the long holes in ivory objects of all kinds. 

The final smoothing of the surface of the ivory piece was effected by rubbing it 
against a fine-grained stone or in the hand where fine sand was held; lastly, two 
pieces of ivory were rubbed against each other and thus a polished surface produced.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 775 

The etching was done with sharp edges of fragments of fliut. Sometimes these 
stone fragments were skillfully fastened into a piece of wood and used as gravers or 
even as lancets. In later years tiles and saws were nsed to cut the ivory into the 
reiiuired shape, and pieces of steel were used to make the holes. Often a three- 
cornered tile was the instrument used to make the holes. 

The drill bow or other implement or utensil was not jiroduced in a day or even in a 
mouth, as these articles were usually created for personal use. I have known of 
such articles being taken along while on a protracted hunting expedition and there 
worked upon to while away the oftentimes tedious hours of watching game. Again 
I have known Avhen a native hadre(iuesteda friend to etch some design, and in their 
festivals, commemorating their dead, these articles were often presented and highly 
cherished as gifts. Other articles of ivory often passed as a legacy from a relative 
to another, and highly valued by the owner. 

With respect to the walrus ivory and autler, both of which are 
employed by the engraver for the portrayal of various figures, Mr. 
Turner writes : ^ 

You will observe many of the. larger objects of ivory and antler have outer or 
engraved portions of herder substance than the inner or core portion. You will per- 
ceive that in bent or curved aft'airs the outer i)art is always the denser portion of 
the material. This or these substances warp or curve because of their unequal 
density of parts. The native saw that heat would uushape a straight piece of ivory 
or antler, and, taking advantage of what the sun did, he laid aside the piece where 
it would become moist, and then placed it before the tire, core next to the tire, and 
warping was the result. 

In the winter the heat of the sun was not sufficient to produce harm, but when the 
warm rays l)egan to heat objects, the native was careful to put his ivory or bone 
implements of the chase in the shade of a house or on the side of his cache, or within 
a place where heat could not alfect it. 

I never saw them dip any such object in liot^water or try to bend it by force. 

The absence of graphic art among the Eskimo of Greenland, Labra- 
dor, and the region between Hudson Bay and the Mackenzie Ifiver, 
can not entirely be attributed to the lack of horn, bone, and walrus 
ivory, as one or more of these materials appear al)undant in certain 
localities. By graphic art as here named is not intended the ordinary 
ornamentation by means of lines, dots, etc., nor the sketches on paper 
referred to by Doctor Rink, but the etchings upon the severnl materials 
by means of gravers, to portray graphically records of hunting expe- 
ditions, shamanistic ceremonies, and other subjects of which numerous 
examples are here given passim. The great supply of ivory in Alaska 
comes from near Port Muller, in Bristol Bay, and the more northern 
coast and islands. Mr. Dall, who is autliority for this statement, adds, ' 
furthermore, "that the amount of walrus ivory taken annually will 
average 1()0,0()0 pounds."^ 

Some of the utensils in the iSTational Museum are made of fossil ivory; 
and of this to Mr. Dall remarks, "that it is not uncommon in many 
parts of the valleys of the Yukon and Kuskoquim. It is usually found 
on the surface, not buried as in Siberia, and all that I have seen has 
been so much injured by the weather that it was of little commercial

value. It is usually blackened, split, and so fragile as to break readily 
iu pieces. It has also been found on tbe shores of Kotzebue Sound and 
the Arctic coast." ^ 

Captain William Edward Parry,^ during his second voyage for the 
discovery of a northwest passage, found the walrus in tolerable abun- 
dance in latitude 08° 22' 21" north, and longitude (by chronometer) 
81° 56' 55" west, which places the locality on the east coast of Mel- 
ville Peninsula. He remarks : 

In the course of this day the walruses became more and more numerous every 
hour, lying in large herds upon the loose pieces of drift ice; and it having fallen 
calm at 1 p. m., we dispatched our boats to endeavor to kill some for the sake of 
the oil which they afford. On approaching the ice, our peojile found them huddled 
close to, and even lying upon, one another, in separate droves of from twelve to 
thirty, the whole number near the boats being perhaps about two hundred. Most 
of them waited quietly to be fired at, and even after one or two discharges did not 
seem to be greatly disturbed, but allowed the people to land on the ice near them, 
and, when approached, showed an evident disposition to give battle. After they had 
got into the water, three were struck w^ith harpoons and killed from the boats. 
When first wounded, they became quite furious, and one which had been struck 
from Captain Lyon's boat made a resolute attack upon her and injured several of 
the planks with its enormous tusks. 

The author above cited mentions, furthermore, the occurrence of 
reindeer and musk ox, both species of animals furnished with horns 
that might readily furnish excellent materials upon which to inscribe 
pictorial representations of exjdoits or events. Great abundance of 
the former are killed in the summer time, "partly by driving them 
from islands or narrow necks of land into the sea, and then spearing 
them from their canoes, and partly by shooting them from behind 
heaps of stones raised for the purpose of watching them, and imitating 
their peculiar bellow or grunt. Among the various artifices Avhich they 
employ for this purpose, one of the most ingenious consists in two men 
walking directly from the deer they wish to kill, when the animal 
almost always follows them. As soon as they arrive at a large stone, 
one of the men hides behind it with his bow, while the other, continuing 
to walk on, soon leads the deer within range of his companion's arrows. 
They are also very careful to keep to leeward of the deer, and will 
scarcely go out after them at all when the weather is calm.'" 

HORN. 

Quite a number of specimens of Eskimo workmanship, upon wbicli 
both simple forms of ornamentation and pictographic records occur, 
consist of pieces of reindeer horn, obtained from the Barren-ground 
caribou or reindeer, shaped into the form desired for the purpose. In 
plate 12 is reproduced a museum group of Woodland caribou {Rangifer

tarandus caribou Kerr), a variety found farther south than the Barren- 
ground variety, which is believed to be the one best known to the 
Alaskan Eskimo. Several utensils employed in net weaving are shown 
in plate 13, figs. 1, 2, 3, and several short, stout slabs of horn, neatly 
ornamented with animals and short records of hunting exploits, are 
represented in plate 14, figs. 2-7. 

^o specimens of horn of either the mountain sheep or the mountain 
goat, both of which are employed by various other and more southern 
coast tribes, have as yet been found in the collection of eitber the 
National Museum, or that of the Alaska Commercial Company, in San 
Francisco, California. 

BONE. 

Another article very often met with, inscribed with various kinds of 
ornamentation and pictorial work, consists of bone, both the larger 
bones of the legs and ribs of reindeer, and the humerus of the swan, 
the latter serving as tubes for needle cases or snuff' tubes. Specimens 
are shown farther on. 

A small piece of bone, rudely incised, is shown herewith in plate 14, 
fig. 1. 

Some ornamented bone knives will be referred to under the special 
class of subjects to which the records pertain. Such weapons are 
employed in skinning and sometimes in cutting up animals, and native 
portrayals of such avocations are also reproduced in several illustra- 
tions. The handles, and sometimes the blades of such knives, some 
with steel blades used in working and fashioning the ivory rods and bag 
handles, are decorated as in plate 15, fig. 1. 



Wood is sometimes used for various articles, such as boxes for tobacco, 
small utensils and tools, and women's trinkets. These are frequently 
incised, but the ornamentation is limited to simple figures composed of 
straight lines, and perhaps dots. 

In the country of the Magemuts — who inhabited the vicinity of Cape 
Eomanzoff" and reach nearly to the mouth of the Yukon Eiver — wood is 
reported as very scarce, and is an article of trade.* 

Wood is sometimes used for ornaments, masks, and toys, the surface 
of which may be whitened, and upon this other designs are portrayed. 
Such an instance is shown in plate 16, consisting of a dancing mask. 

The Greenland map, before mentioned, may also be noted in this con- 
nection. 

The only other exami)les in the collections of the National Museum 
are from Point Barrow, and may here be reproduced, together with the 
descrif)tions given by Mr. Murdoch :

himself, indicatiu<;' that he is contemplating something or has performed 
some deed; the third space contains the conventional figure of a 
whale's tail to indicate that animal, and in the remaining space, at the 
bottom, is a whale with what appears to denote a float attached to a 
harpoon line. 

The other side of the tablet, that bearing the cord, has in the left- 
hand space an animal probably intended to denote a wolf; the upper 
panel has within it a deer, the horns being turned back, whereas to 
denote the reindeer they would be turned forward; the uext, like the 
first, appears to be a wolf, while the fourth has two animals seated 
upon tbeir haunches, facing one another, after the manner of dogs, 
although they appear- to closely resemble the first and third, which are 
believed to denote wolves, as before stated.

DAN(UNG GORGET OF WOOD; FROM POINT BARKOW.. 

Au old and weatherworn mask from Point Barrow is shown in fig. 2. 
It is made of spruce wood, and measures 7i inches in length, it is 
peculiar in having the outer corners of the eyes somewhat depressed, 
and in addition to the mustache and imperial has a broad "whaleman's 
mask " drawn with black lead across the eyes. 

^fr. Murdoch' says of the specimen that "this mask has been for a 
long time fastened to au ornamented wooden gorget, and appeared to 
liave been exposed to the weather, perhaps at a cemetery. The string- 
is made of unusually stout sinew braid." 

A decorated gorget is shown in tig. 3. It is from Point Barrow, and 
Mr. Murdoch' describes it thus: 

It is made of spruce, is 18.5 inches loug, aud has two beckets of stout sinew braid, 
one to go round the ueck and the other round the body under the wearer's arms.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



The figures are all painted ou the front face. In the middle is a man painted with red 
ocher; all the rest of the figures are black and probably painted with soot. The 
man with his arms outstretched stands on a large whale, represented as spouting. 
He holds a small Avhale in each hand. At his right is a small cross-shaped object 
which perhaps represents a bird, then a man facing toward the left and darting a 
harpoon witli both hands, and a bear facing to the left. Ou the left of the red man 
are two umiaks with five men in each, a whale nearly eftaced, and three of the crow- 
shaped objects already mentioned. Below them also, freshly drawn with a hard, 
blunt lead pencil or the point of a bullet, are a whale, an umiak, and a three-cornered 
object the nature of which I can not make out. 

A similar gorget, from the same place, is sliown in fig. 4, and appears 
to liave been long exposed to the weather, perhaps at a cemetery, as 
the figures are'all effaced except in the middle, where it was probably 
''covered by a mask as in fig. 2, which was from the same village." 




DANCING GOEGET OF WOOD; FKOM POINT BAEKOW. 



Mr. Murdoch says of this that "there seems to have been a red bor 
der on the serrated edge. In the middle is the same red man as before 
standing on the black whale and holding a whale in each hand. At 
his right is a black umiak with five men in it, and at his left a partially 
effaced figure which is perhaps another boat." The strings are for 
securing the gorget to the dancer's neck and body. 

Mr. Murdoch^ remarks of the human figure holding the whales: 
"This man or giant, able to hold out a whale, appears to be a legend- 
ary character, as we have his image carved in ivory. We unfortu-

iiately did uot succeed in learning anything more about lilm, except 
that his name (apparently) was ' Kikamigo.'" 

"These gorgets appear to have gone out ol fashion," continues the 
above-named author, " as we saw none which were not very old, or 
which appeared to have been used recently.'' ' 



Copper, brass, and white metal (consisting of block tin, lead, etc.), as 
well as an occasional specimen of iron, will be met with bearing rude 
designs in ornamentation. Very little is done also in silver, especially 
in the manufacture of bracelets, an art which was imported from the 
Thlinkit, who, in turn, obtained their first suggestions and patterns 
from the Haida Indians. Mr. Murdoch reports the practice of engrav- 
ing iron-pipe picks and flint steels at Point Barrow. 

SKINS OF ANIMALS. 

Tanned hides of walrus are sometimes used for purposes where a 
touch here or there of ornamentation seems to be desired by the native 
Eskimo. 

lieindeer skin and the small peltries used for articles of clothing are 
sometimes decorated with designs in color by means of small wooden 
tools resembling spoons, of which the back of the bowl is cut into pat- 
terns, which are then moistened with the pigments or stains, and 
filially impressed upon the skin or fabric. This process is very like 
that practiced by the South Sea Islanders in decorating some forms of 
tapa cloth. 

TATTOOING. 

The human skin is also used for the portrayal of various designs, the 
practice of tattooing varying among the several tribes or bands of 
Eskimo between Alaska and Greenland. Plate 4 represents a Port 
Clarence girl with typical tattooing upon the chin. In the female the 
designs are usually limited to such vertical bars upon the chin. On 
Plate 22, fig. 7, is also shown tattooing by pictography upon a carved 
face. 

Keferring to the Eskimo of Melville Peninsula, Captain Parry ^ 
remarks: 

Among their personal ornaments must also be reckoned that mode of marking the 
body called tattooing, which, of the customs not essential to the comfort or hapi)i- 
ness of mankind, is perhaps the most extensively practiced throughout the world. 
Among these people it seems to be an ornament of indispensable imi)0itance to the 
women, not one of them being without it. The operation is performed about the age 
of ten or sometimes earlier and has nothing to do with marriage, except that, being 
considered in the light of a personal charm, it may serve to recommend them as 
wives. The parts of the body thus marked are their faces, arms, hands, thighs, and 
in some few women the breasts, but never the feet, as in Greenland.

Atlantic to the Pacific. London, 1824. 



782 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The operation is very expeditiously mauaged by passing a needle and thread, the 
latter covered with lamp black and oil, nuder the epidermis, according to a pattern 
previously marked out upon the skin. Several sketches being thus taken at once, 
the thumb is pressed ujiou the part, while the thread is drawn through, by which 
means the coloring matter is retained and a permanent dye of a blue tinge imparted 
to the skin. 

Ill the absence of needles, says the author, a strip of whalebone is 
used as a substitute. It is furthermore stated that the patterns " are 
nearly the same in all," and that " a little of this kind of mark is on the 
back part of their hands; and with them we understood it to be con- 
sidered as a souvenir of some distant or deceased person who had 
performed it." 

Marks of distinction by tattooing are employed by the men to denote 
success in whaling. " Those men who are or bave been captains of 
whaling umiaks that have taken whales have marks tattooed some- 
where on their person, sometimes forming a definite tally." ^ 

Mr. Murdoch refers to an exani])le in the person of a native named 
Afioru, who had a broad band tattooed across each cheek, extending 
from the corner of the mouth backward toward the lobe of the ear. 
These bands were made up of many indistinct lines, which were said 
to indicate "many whales." Another instance was that of a native 
who "had the ' flukes' of seven whales in a line across the chest." 

The wife of the former " had a little mark tattooed on each corner of 
her mouth, which she said were ' whale marks,' indicating that she was 
the wife of a successful whaleman." ' 

McGlure notes that at Cape Bathurst he observed that a successful 
harpooner had a blue line drawn across the bridge of the nose,^ and, 
according to Armstrong, he has a line tattooed from the inner angle 
of the ej^e across the cheek, a new one being added for every wliale 
he strikes.^ Father Petitot remarks that in this region whales are 
"scored" by "tattooing crosses on the shoulder, and that a murderer 
is marked across the nose with a couple of horizontal lines." ^ It is 
interesting, says Murdoch, that one of the "striped" men at Nuwuk 
told us he had killed a man. In east Greenland tattooing is similarly 
performed. Holm, remarking, in reference to the residents at Angina- 
gralik, that "Ma^ndene ere kun undtagelsvis tatoverede og da kun 
nied enkelte mindre Streger paa Arme og Haandled. for at Kunne

INSTRUMENTS AND COLORS. 

A'arious instruments are employed by the Eskimo in preparing for 
the reception of pictographs the several substances used for that 
jiurpose. The pigments are now chiefly obtained from the trader,

fcliougli in former times they were prepared from luiiieial and vegetable 
substances. 

Plate 17 represents two saws used in cutting ivory. The specimen 
shown in fig. 1 is from Port Clarence, and appears to be made of a 
piece of a steel saw of American manufacture, but from the appearance 
of the specimen the teeth were filed into it by the native. It is 
hrtfted to a piece of ivory and secured by means of a niece of metal, 
apparently a nail. 

Plate 17, fig. 2, represents a saw of a thinner piece of metal with a 
very irregularly filed cutting edge. It is attached to a piece of ivory, 
and was obtained at Anderson River. This instrument was used in 
splitting walrus tusks lengthwise, as well as cutting them into shorter 
pieces when necessary. In the bone or ivory comb represented in Plate 
22, fig. 4, may be seen the effects of native sawing and an attempt to 
make teeth. 

Several forms of knives before referred to are illustrated in i)late 15. 
The upper left-hand figure (fig. 1) is a wood-working knife, obtained at 
St. Michaels, and sent to the Museum by Mr. E. W. Nelson. The handle 
is made of a rib, a slot in the forward end being made there to receive 
the laterally curved blade, and in this respect resembling to a limited 
degree the type used by most of the Indians of the Great Lakes. The 
blade is secured by means of a thong. 

LI])on the back or obverse side of the handle is a depression one-eighth 
of an inch deep and five- sixteenths of an inch in diameter, which shows 
ample evidence of having been used in holding a fire drill, or some other 
variety of drill. IJpon the front side of the handle appears the outlines 
of three sailing vessels, immediately behind the right-hand figure being 
a pit surrounded by a circle with four radiating lines, beyond which are 
indications of an attempt to make other concentric circles. 

These knives are used in fashioning wood into various forms, and 
also, sometimes, in shaving the roughened edges of ivory rods. 

The specimen at the upper right hand (fig. 2) is from Kotzebue Sound. 
The handle, like the prec^eding, is made of a rib, while the arrow-shaped 
piece of metal constituting the blade is secured by means of two rivets, 
one of iron and one of copper, while the anterior, a third one, has fallen 
out, leaving only the perforation. 

The cutting edge is slightly concave from point to base and ma,y 
have been made so intentionally for the purpose of causing slight con- 
vexity to the surface operated upon. This style of knife is also some- 
times employed in shaving down ivory rods to the desired form and 
thickness. 

The third specimen (fig. 3) was obtained at Norton Sound. This bone 
gouge or chisel represents the type of tool used for stripping off birch 
bark for canoes before the iron tools were introduced. It is apparently 
made of the leg bone of a reindeer and bears ornamentation of peculiar 
interest. The transverse bars consist of parallel lines by twos, and 



784 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

several times by threes, between which is the alternating dentate ijat- 
tern, the result of the interlacing, or alternate approximation, of points, 
the intervening surface resulting in a fine zigzag pattern. The simple 
zigzag lines occur near the middle of the specimen, while the small lat- 
eral ornaments resembling bird tracks are conventional tree patterns. 

The incisions are all stained with what appears to be red ocher. 
Total length is 12 j^ inches; has a sharp cutting edge and shows evi 
dence of much use. 

The ivory snow knife (fig. 4) was collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson at 
the Ohalitmut village, and occupies the bottom place on plate 15. The 
specimen is 14J inches in length and 1|^ inches across the widest part 
of the tolerably sharp blade. The bottom of the handle is ornamented 
with seven projections representing seal heads, the eyes and mouth of 
each being clearly cut and blackened. Along the top or back of the 
blade are three parallel creases, crossed at intervals by short lines. 
The upper edge of each side of the blade has two parallel lines extend- 
ing from the base to near the tip, from the lower one of which extend 
short <^ shaped ornaments resembling the legs on some of the Eskimo 
mythic animals. The line, extending almost halfway along the bottom 
edge of the blade, has single short lines projecting backward, at a slight 
angle, at intervals of about half an inch apart. This is a simpler form 
of ornament, though of the same type as that upon the upper side of 
the blade. 

Along the center, on either side, is a line terminating at the middle 
of the blade in a circle within which is another and a central perfora- 
tion filled with a hard wooden peg. 

The central line on each side has simple, short, oblique lateral 
incisions as ornaments, while the outer circle has lines radiating at the 
cardinal points. 

On plate 18 are reproduced three bone skin dressers, figs. 1 and 3 
being obtained from the Thlingit Indians, while fig. 2 was secured at 
Sitka, no specific tribe being referred to in the records accompanying 
the object. 

The ornamentation on plate 18, fig. 1 consists chiefly of three rows of 
small squares being arranged in order to resemble a checkered surface, 
the one series of squares being plain while the other is specified by 
cross lines. At the upper edge, embracing a little more than one- third 
of the surface, is a longitudinal surface marked by pairs of diagonal 
lines. 

The specimen on plate 18, fig. 2, has most of the surface of one side 
divided off into three rectangles, all but one of the lines forming the 
boundaries, being decorated on the inner side by broken series of small 
triangles. This is a common Eskimo pattern, but has not the oppos- 
ing fellow so as to form the zigzag. The pattern does not occur on 
other specimens of like workmanship from the Thlingit Indians, or 
from Sitka, excepting in the specimen on plate 46, fig. 3, in which two

short rows of triangular figures appear near the middle, while at the 
left are three large triangular patterns placed so as to form a zigzag, 
or V-shaped, design, this being merely an enlarged illustration of the 
smaller patterns above noted. At the other end of this specimen is a 
group of isolated transverse lines; from the middle of the end is 
issuing a continuous horizontal line, IJ inches in length, terminating 
in a bifurcation exactly resembling the common Eskimo conventional 
tree pattern. In the middle sjiace of the tool is a pair of parallel hori- 
zontal lines, also terminating in similar bifurcations; this, however, 
may be meaningless, though it resembles a doubletree symbol, or it 
might also be taken as denoting a seine shuttle, examx)les of which 
are given in several illustrations. 
Mr. L. M. Turner writes : ' 

Circles are made with a graver; formerly a sharp corner of flint set in a stick. 
* " * In later clays a three-cornered file, one worn ont, was substituted, and the 
manner in which I saw him — an expert ivory worker at St. Michaels — use it was 
simply pushing it from him, turning the ivory round as the circle was graved, a 
little deeper at each turn. 

The straight decorated lines were made as two deep channels at a suitable width 
apart; the serrations were made by pushing from the outer edge of the ridge 
toward the groove. These sculptures are not made in a day, week, or month; many 
objects are not completed in years, as many of them arc life histories of the indi- 
vidual. The Innuit is never in a hurry, and each thinks he has a lifetime before 
him. 

The Kaniags or Kaniaks, the inhabitants of the island of Kadiak 
and surrounding islands, " are possessed of great skill in carving- 
figures and other objects from walrus tusks, the material being 
obtained from the Alaska Peninsula." Mr. Ivan Petroff,^ whose words 
I am quoting, remarks furthermore: 

They also make very nicely carved^ snuffboxes of whalebone. Formerly all these 
objects were worked with stone implements, but the use of iron has long been 
known to the Kaniags, who used it at the arrival of the Russians. The savages 
said that iron was occasionally cast upon the beach by the waves [sic!]. 

Reference has been made to the steel-pointed native-made gravers 
used in various processes of engraving. In plate 19 are represented 
five instruments, fig. 1 of which was obtained at Kotzebue Sound by 
Mr. E. W. Nelson. The handle, a little over 5 inches in length, is 
made of bone. A slight slot was cut at the large end, into which was 
inserted a short piece of iron or steel, secured by wrapping with thin 
cord, apparently of sinew. The point of the instrument is acute, and 
admirably adapted for etching or scraping. 

The second figure from the top (fig. 2) was secured at Anderson 
River by Mr. R. McFarlane. The bone handle bears indentations, so as 
to admit of secure grasping. The point of steel is inserted in the end

and filed down to a narrower widtli than that hidden from view. The 
point measures 3% of an inch in height and is only about 7^4 of an inch 
thick. The front edge is not at right angles to the sides, and thus 
furnishes a better and sharper cutting edge. 

The third or middle specimen (fig. 3) is from the same locality as the 
preceding. The handle consists of two pieces of bone, so arranged as 
to unite smoothly and also to hold in place a piece of steel, which has 
been sunk partly in each half of the handle by means of a slot made 
by sawing. The two pieces are finally tied together with a sinew cord. 
The apex of the graver is rather more acute than in the preceding 
specimen. 

The back of the tool is also ground to a cutting edge, to be used 
in scraping smooth such surfaces requiring treatment previous to 
engraving. 

An interesting specimen occupies the fourth place in the series (fig. 
4). This is from Port Clarence, where it was obtained by Mr. W. H. 
Ball. The two pieces of bone composing the handle are secured to one 
another by means of a peg passing vertically through them, and two 
wooden pegs, of no special use apparently, are inserted in handle trans- 
versely. Like in the preceding, a slot has been made with the front of 
each piece so as to secure the flat piece of metal constituting the blade. 
The point is neatly finished, and it will be observed has a very acute 
tip turned downward so as to afford the best possible means for fine 
engraving in hard material. The two pieces of handle are tied together 
with a leather or skin thong. The entire length is 4^ inches. 

The fifth and lower specimen (fig 5) is from Cape Kome, and was 
secured by Mr. E. W. Nelson. The handle is composed of two pieces 
of walrus ivory; two pegs pass vertically through them to hold them 
together, while the broad blade is, as usual, inserted iii slots made in 
both pieces of handle. The wrapping consists of sinew or hide, being 
so covered with a layer of hard grease and dirt as to prevent identifica- 
tion. The front edge of the instrument is at an angle sufticient to 
furnish an excellent cutting edge. The entire length is 4 fV inches. 

In addition to the above remarks concerning the second specimen, it 
is of interest to call attention to the fact that upon the right hand side of 
the handle there occurs a rounded cavity, made with a rude implement, 
which may have been intended for use in drilling — by steadying the 
drill at the top. Such depressions and for such purposes are not rare. 

Mr. L. M. Turner, Captain Herendeen, and others to whom reference 
is made elsewhere state that formerly the natives used fragments of 
flint or quartz with which to engrave and decorate specimens of ivory, 
bone, and other materials used for utensils and weapons. The small 
fragments of siliceous material were inserted in the end of wood or bone 
handles, though sometimes they were large enough to use without the 
aid of a handle. 

After a careful examination of all the engraved specimens of Alaskan 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 787 

art work, in the collections of the National Museum at Washington, Dis- 
trict of Columbia, and the Alaska Commercial Company in San Fran- 
cisco, California, it appears that the more modern specimens of ivory 
are engraved in a manner indicating the use of steel-pointed instru- 
ments, such as are sliown in plate 19. The lines or incisions are fre- 
(luently very pronounced and represent deep regular channels in wliich 
the two sides converge to a sharp cut beneath or at the bottom, resem- 
bling a V-shaped groove of elegant uniformity. In the older specimens 
of ivory carving, snch as are very much surface worn by frequent and 
long continued handling, or have been in the possession of certain 
individuals and families for a long time, the creases have become less 
deep, and where they are sheltered by lateral ridges they still indicate 
an origin of a more primitive kind, being made, perhaps, by less expe- 
rienced artists or with ruder instruments. The numerous hair-line 
scratches and frequent apparently accidental slips of the point would 
indicate the use of a point less acute than the modern steel gravers 
made by the natives at this day, and which are herewith illustrated. 

In some of the later engravings the grooves are regular, deep, and 
pronounced, the cut being sometimes vertical, so as to show the lateral 
edges at right angles to the horizontal base of the groove, indicating a 
strong hand pressure of a square cutting edge. The greater number of 
lines are made, evidently, by using an angle of the graver, the result 
being similar to that resulting from the use of a variety of the three- 
sided or triangular graver used in wood engraving. 

An examination of the ends of short lines, especially those employed 
in simple ornamentation, illustrates at once that most of them are made 
by cutting from the outside toward the main object or body of the 
design. In this manner the very short lines resemble arrow-headed 
ornaments or projections, or minute triangles. This is particularly 
apparent in some of the specimens referred to in connection with 
conventionalizing and to the art of the Polynesians. 

Drills and simple borers appear to have been made by securing to 
wooden handles rather thin but elongated pieces of chalcedony, or similar 
siliceous minerals. Slight depressions or pits apparently made by such 
tools are frequent, and it is probable that before the introduction of 
metals nearly all perforations in bone, wood, and probably in ivory, 
were thus made. In larger cavities in bone and ivory, such as would 
serve for steadying the rear or upper end of a fire-drill during rotation 
of the latter, the origin thus attributed is often very clear, the rounded 
cavity, when not yet entirely smoothed off by use, retaining the marks 
of workmanship made by a crude tool or instrument. 

That circles were made by turning the specimen to be engraved and 
holding firmly the stone-pointed graver and pushing it toward the 
specimen has been affirmed by one correspondent; but such instances 
were no doubt rare, and it is believed that no example of a circle, 
nucleated or otherwise, made in this oif hand manner will be found in 
the extensive collection of the National Museum. 



788 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



Captain Herendeen states that sometimes a fragment of flint — though 
generally one of iron or steel and consisting of a narrow strip of perhaps 
the width of a large nail— was filed at the end so as to receive a 
V-shaped notch, one point being a little longer than the other. It is 
well known that pieces of hoop iron, nails, and other articles of iron 
and steel are similarly employed by our native Indian 
tribes, and it would indeed be a strange fact if the Eski- 
mo did not seize upon and utilize such a valuable sub- 
stance as metal when the opportunity was presented, 
and after having seen sailors and others work them 
into desired shape by hammering or filing. 
The nuclei of many — I might almost say 
nearly all — concentric circles are deeper 
than the circles surrounding them. This 
may be the result of having the longer 
point of such a V-shaped notched tool 
forced deeper into the material to be dec- 
orated, giving the instrument a secure 
point for rotation, so that the outer or 
cutting end may not so readily slip from 
its intended course. 

In this manner, and for making concentric 
rings, one such tool would be necessary for 
each size of circle required. Reference to 
the various illustrations will elucidate this 
more clearly. 

Accurate measurements of the diameters 
of circles upon any particular specimens 
indicate the use of a number of such in- 
struments with different sized bits, and 
varying distances between the points. 

Another class of circles, with nuclei, 
appear to be made with auger bits, the 
central pin being filed to a sharp point, while the 
outer vertical cutting edge is alsQ filed so as to cut 
toward the surface of the ivory, and to remove the tex- 
ture upon which the auger is impressed. The grooves 
resulting from such work and with such an instrument 
are sharply defined, with lateral sides and a nearly level 
bottom, while the circles are mathematically accurate 
in form. An illustration of such work is reproduced in 
plate 19, the specimen being from a locality north of Norton Sound. 
The smaller and more delicate circles occur on earrings and other like 
objects of personal adornment, and upon such articles of frequent need 
as sewing utensils, examples of which are given in a number of illus- 
trations.

Fpon the pipestenis also are shown excellent results of such aborigi- 
nal work, the ivory stem shown in plate 20, bearing- eight sets of 
circles, that one nearest the brassboimd mouthpiece consisting of but 
a single circle with its central pit or nucleus one-eighth of an inch 
deep, while the circle itself is but a mere hair line in comparison ; the 
next two figures consist of two circles each with the central spot, the 
next four having three circles each beside the central point, while 
the last, or eighth, has four concentric rings and the central nucleus. 

According to measurement, the inner or i)ri- 
mary circle, in all, is three-sixteenths of an 
inch in diameter; the next larger one, begin- 
ning with the second ring, is one-fourth of an 
inch in diameter; the next larger, being the 
outer circle on the fourth figure, measures 
three-eighths of an inch, while the outer cir- 
cle of the last figure, having four rings, meas- 
ures one half of .an inch in diameter. 

The central pit or nucleus in each of the 
circles, excepting two, is filled with a tightly fitting wooden peg, 
smoothed off level with the surrounding surface, and carefully black- 
ened to accord in color with the surrounding blackened circles. 

This regularity in diameter of the several sizes of circles indicates 
the use of a bit, or tool, of foreign manufacture which the natives 
obtained probably through barter. The sizes increase by one-sixteenth 
of an inch each time a change is made corresponding exactly to the 
regulation sizes used by carpenters and other Avorkers in wood. 

Drills are used for perforating all kinds of materials, wood, bone, 
ivory, and even metals, and are much more common than awls among 
the more northern natives. The handles are of wood and sometimes 

bone, the x>oint being made 
of iron or steel, though before 
the introduction of metals 
flint and similar siliceous ma- 
terials were employed in arm- 
ing the tool. 

The illustration given in 
fig. 5 is a bone pointed drill 
from Point Barrow, while fig. 
a represents one with an iron drill mounted in a handle of spruce wood 
which was once painted with red ocher. When the natives use the drill 
and bow, both hands are necessarily occupied, one in steadying the 
object to be perforated while with the other the bow is held and moved 
horizontally to rotate the drill. 

Therefore, to produce the necessary pressure upon the to]) of the 
drill, the native puts into his mouth a drill mouthpiece in which the 
top of drill rotates. Fig. 7 represents a mouthpiece with an iron

socket, while iu fig. 8 is another also of wood, but holdiug a socket of 
syenite to withstand the friction of the drill. 

Some of the specimens in the collections of the National Museum are 
decorated with the usual deep incisions found in Point Barrow bag- 
handles and tinted with what appears to be red ocher. 

In several instances the wooden pegs inserted in the perforations 
made to represent eyes, ears, or nostrils, of small animal forms, are 
colored, and in other specimens, such as earrings, glass or porcelain 
beads are inserted instead. 

After the etchings have been made in the ivory or other material, 
the creases or incisions are colored so as to bring out the design in 
sharp contrast to the surrounding surface. 

Mr. Turner informs me that "the black substance used to color the 
etched lines was from the charcoal prepared from burned grass, then 
powdered, mixed with oil, and rubbed into the etching. Afterwards the 
begrimed hand of the owner was sufficient to renew the coloring mat- 
ter. Some of the etchings are colored with a red substance which (an 
innovation in the art) is procured from the traders' stock." 

Mr. W. H. Dall remarks: 

The coloration of wooden articles with native pigments is of ancient origin, but 
all the more elaborate instances that have come to my knowledge bore marks of 
comparatively recent origin. The pigments used were blue carbonates of iron and 
copper ; the green fungus, or peziza, found in decayed birch and alder wood ; hema- 
tite and red chalk; white infusorial or chalky earth ; black charcoal, graphite, and 
micaceous ore of irons. 

A species of red was sometimes derived from pine bark or the cambium of ground 
willow. In later prehistoric burial places, the wooden earrings bear the colors 
nearly as bright as when first applied. 

PORTRAYAL OF NATURAL AND OTHER OBJECTS. 

Iu the following illustrations, which represent selected figures from 
various records, will be noted the several styles of illustrating like 
species of animals, and the fidelity of expression and outline of some 
specimens in further illustration of the intimate acquaintance by the 
aboriginal artist of the subject by which he attempted to portray his 
skill. 

Plate 12 serves to illustrate the form of the Barren-ground caribou 
or Alaskan reindeer, as well as the horns of the male and female, while 
in the representation of the form of the walrus similar accuracy is 
attained, as may be observed by comparing numerous etchings with 
the illustration on Plate 11, which represents an exceedingly well- 
formed walrus. 

In fig. 9 is presented a herd of reindeer shown in various attitudes, 
the general execution of the figures being very cleverly done. The 
heads of some are turned to the front, thus showing decided success in 
an attempt at foreshortening; some of the animals are lying down, as 
if resting, while others appear to be browsing.

The animals composiug the herd in flg. 10 are engraved so as to rep- 
resent them in various attitudes. In JSTo. 1 the animal appears to be 
comin<; up, as out of a depression, or water, while in ISTo. 2 the animal 
is grazing. No. 3 is in the act of lying down, as shown in the bent 
legs. In No. 4 the animal is lying down, and the head is drawn so as 
to make it appear as if looking either toward or away from the beholder.

Foreshortening is of rare occurrence in primitive art, but besides the 
preceding instance the animal in No. G is also partly portrayed in such 
an attitude. No. 5 is not definitely depicted, the horns being in 
such relative position with the body as if the animal's head were turned 
around as if it were licking its side. No. 7 is a doe, while No. 8 is a 
male, without any indication of action being shown.

HERD OF REINDEER. 

In fig. 11 the native artist has certainly expressed an intimate acquaint- 
ance with the habits of deer. The attitude of the animal in No. 1 
seems one of careless interest, if it may be so designated, in what the 
rest of his comrades may show more concern. No. 2 is in the attitude 
of rising from the ground, while that in No. 3 exhibits a desire to move 
away as if from an enemy. No. 4 is shown, by the position of the legs,

to exhibit more activity in hastening away. The foreshortening visible 
in No. 5 seems to place the leader of the herd in the attitude of a pro- 
tector, being on the defensive, and showing a disinclination to run 
away from those over whom he may have exercised the privileges or 
rights of a leader. In this instance, as in the following illustration, 
very excellent workmanship and artistic taste are exhibited. 
In the illustration shown in fig. 12 the deer have congregated

because of an alarm, their heads being directed forward toward the 
behoUIer, the foreshortening being admirably executed. Four animals 
are indicated, three being so closely placed as to make identification 
rather difficult. 

The various attitudes of reindeer portrayed in fig. 13 are readily 
discernible, the heads and horns aiding in specifically distinguishing 
the sexes, as also the various degrees of interest manifested at an 
alarm, caused by the unseen approach of a hunter. The figure at the 
right end of the illustration shows the native crawling up behind a 
hillock covered with tall grass and weeds, his hand holding an arrow 
and bow which he pushes forward before him. Several of the animals 
are drawn foreshortened, an attempt in art seldom found among the 
aborigines. 

Plate 21, fig. 3, is a drill bow, and is from Kotzebue Sound. The 
upper or convex side represents a herd of thirteen reindeer in various 
attitudes of moving forward and grazing. The fourth animal from the 
left end is drawn with its head very gracefully elevated and looking 
backward, a fact very unusual in an aboriginal pictograph. The 
curves are deep and heavy and quite characteristic of the engravings 
of natives of the region from which the specimen was obtained.

HERD OF REINDEER. 

This illustration is from the same bow of which the reverse is shown 
in plate '22, fig. 2. 

Plate 21, fig. G, is also a drill bow from Kotzebue Sound, and is 
very yellow with age. The figures portrayed denote reindeer. The 
peculiarity of this record is the depth of the incisions forming the 
characters, indicating bold, strong work. The under surface of the 
bow also bears the outlines of reindeer (somewhat larger than those 
upon the opposite side), which are drawn with great fidelity to specific 
features, with the exception of the shape of the body. The peculiari- 
ties of the horns are carefully noted by the artist, and the various 
attitudes are exceedingly natural. 

Plate 22, fig. 2, represents a drill bow also from Kotzebue Sound, 
measuring 14 inches in length along the convex surface. The record 
portrays thirteen reindeer and three animals which may belong to the 
same species, although because of their shorter necks and stouter 
bodies identification is uncertain. The herd seems to be moving for- 
ward, some of them engaged in browsing, and some attempt appears 
to be made at perspective. The three short lines at the upper right- 
hand side of the bow immediately above and in front of the right-hand 
figures of the deer are the outlines of three otter. All of these

eugraviDgs are characteristic of the crude deeply incised lines of the 
work accomplished by the Indians of Kotzebue Sound and vicinity. 

Plate 23, &g. 2, is a bone seine shuttle from Cape ISTome. This is 
ornamented with several almost indefinite lines at the left, i^robably 
representing seals, while the four conspicuous characters represent 
well engraved outlines of the reindeer. The shading or marking upon 
the bodies of the animals is indicative of the markings of color upon 
the animal, and upon the two middle figures this marking is indicated 
by delicate vertical lines very artistically rendered. 

Plate 24, fig. 4, represents a triangular drill bow obtained at Cape 
Nome. The specimen measures 13^ inches in length. The thirteen 
figures at the left represent walruses, two of them heading toward a 
kaiak occupied by a single hunter who appears to be chased by a 
walrus coming from the opposite direction, as if it had been pursued 
and probably angered by the five hunters shown in the umiak immedi- 
ately to the right of it. The native in the stern end of this umiak has 
successfully harpooned a walrus, as is indicated by the delicate zigzag 
line connecting his hand with the harpoon which is securely embedded 
in the breast of the animal. Now, turning the bow upside down, there 
will be seen two walruses being towed along by an umiak occupied by 
five hunters. Immediately to the left of this umiak 
is another boat of similar construction which has just 
been pulled on shore, as the position of the boat indi- 
cates, as well as the attitude of the six natives walk- 
ing along toward the left, each with something in his 
hands, which has evidently been taken from the boatj 
and which has been captured or secured on the hunt. The remaining 
six figures indicate habitations. Again reversing the bow to the origi- 
nal position, opposite to the beached umiak is a wah'us which has been 
captured by the hunters in the umiak proceeding toward the right and 
toward another walrus which is there shown. The remaining six fig- 
ures indicate habitations and storehouses, while between the former 
are shown human figures in various attitudes as if occupied in different 
tasks. The under sides of the bow bear hunting records, numbers of 
which will be shown in other connections. 

On plate 25, fig. 3, is shown a box for fungus ash. This appears to 
be made of a piece of bone, is very crude, and bears about the middle 
a row of five figures, the larger one representing a whale, the next a 
reindeer, while the three smaller ones appear to be animals of the same 
species. 

Fig. 14 probably denotes one of the water birds, though why it fig- 
ures on the ivory drill bow without any other characters, in context, it 
is impossible to say. The attemi)t at engraving a record may have 
been abandoned. 

The two characters shown in fig. 15, are without doubt deer, as no 
other species of the family is found in Alaska in which the tangs of 
the horns project from the posterior ridge of the main branch. In the

elk, which is not found so far north, the tangs project from the ante- 
rior ridge, while in the reindeer the horn is specifically bent forward 

at the middle, and the 
anterior prong, or "snow 
shovel," is also usually 
indicated. 

The accompanying il- 
lustration of the rein- 
deer, fig. 16, is carefully 
drawn to Indicate the peculiarity of the curved horns. It is rather too 
short in the limbs in comparison to the size of the body, and although 
the work is tolerably good, comparison with 
other illustrations will be found to be of interest. 
Fig. 17 is a variant of the 
proceeding-, and much better 
in both resemblance to the 
animal it is intended to 

represent as well as in an artistic point of view. 
The accompanying figures illustrate the various 
typical forms of the same animal as drawn by the 
natives of various parts of the west coast of Alaska. Fig. 18 repre- 
sents some etchings from a specimen obtained iu Point Barrow, though 
the style of en- 
graving is not 
very much like 
that of those 
people. 

Thisapi)ears 
to be one of 
the few groups 
iu which the 

horns are so unusually high and in which each animal has but two 
legs, one at each end of the body. 

A specimen of the reindeer shown in fig. 19 is from a fragment of a 

bone obtained at Nor- 
ton Sound. Although 
the interior decora- 
tion consists of cross 
lines, these are diago- 
nal instead of at right 
angles, as before. A 
great diflereuce in the 
art work is visible. 
The reindeer is followed by a wolf. Two interesting specimens are 
reproduced from specimen from Kotzebue Sound. The character shown

general curvature.

ably drawn, while at the same time maintain- 
ing the typical spe- 
cific features which

other native drawings of the reindeer. 

Plate 26, fig. 1, represents a seal drag 
from St. Michaels. Upon the upper portion 
of the ivory utensil are neat outlines of 
wolves, made with 
considerable delica- 
cy-. The ornamental lines npon which they 
stand and those encircling the ends of the or- 
nament are a sort of meander or crude zigzag, 
of which a description is 

given elsewhere in connection with decoration. 
Plate 14, fig. 1, represents a Iragment of bone 
from Norton Sound, upon which is a rude etching 
of a reindeer approaching a wolf, the latter in an 
inverted position. At the right hand 
is a perforation, about Avhich is a rude circle ornamented 
with four radiating lines. Beneath this circle are two par- 
allel curved lines with inner radiating lines, resulting in a 
very crude meander pattern. 

The illustration of a wolf (fig. 23) shows the fangs in 
the partly open mouth, the stiff ears, and long bushy tail. 
The markings upon the body may be simply in imitation 
of the etchings found upon most outline or solid figures, 
though they greatly suggest the brindled fur of

The engraving seems to have been made with a very sharp 
tool, as the outlines are groups of thin parallel hair lines. 

The selected character reproduced in fig. 25 is so unusual 
in general form, as found upon ivory or other engravings of 
the Eskimo, that its presentation here is of interest for purposes 
of comparison with the pictographs of other peoples, especially the 
petroglyphs of the western and southwestern, or Pacific Coast States,

Two figures shown in close embrace, as in fig. 20, may also denote 
combat, as well as the ceremonial of tlie shaman, in whicli the demon 
causing the illness is shown near the body of the sick person from 
which it is expelled. 

The group of figures of the human form (fig. 27) are selected from a 
number of engravings ou ivory bows, chiefly from southern Alaska.

graphs on wood, as when drawn upon slabs of shingle or other smooth

for any purpose. It is abbreviated, and the result of carelessness or 
perhaps incompetency of the recorder. No. 2 is another form of man 
in which only the lower extremities are indicated, while in No. 3 the 
arms are thrown out horizontally from the body to denote the gesture 
for negation, nothing. No. 4 is a headless body and does not always 
denote death, as is the practice among other pictograjjhers, notably so 
the Ojibwa. No special information was received respecting the char- 
acter, and it is probable that the head was obliterated by erosion, 
having originally been drawn. The specimen was copied from an ivory 
utensil in the collection of the Alaska Commercial Company in San 
Francisco, California, and was obtained from the Aiqalu'xamut Eskimo.

arms loosely extended, and form in No. 8, having fringe suspended 
from the sleeves, probably a shaman, and very similar to the Ojibwa

bow obtained at Port Clarence, Alaska, by Doctor T. H. Bean, formerly 
of the United States National Museum.

WHALING SHIPS NEAR A PINE-COVERED SHORE. 



The portrayal by the native artist of boats, both the kaiak and the 
umiak, is of such frequent occurrence in the Alaskan etchings and toy 
carvings that the photographic reproduction of native -made models 
may be deemed of special interest. Plate 27 represents a kaiak, while 
the illustration shown 
in plate 28 represents an 
umiak with raised sail. 
Comparisons with 
etchings are suggested, 
as numerous examples 
of the former occur in 

abundance, and will be referred to elsewhere and in another connection. 
Fig. 28 represents four vessels rigged up with sails, the one at the 
extreme left being manned by Americans or mixed bloods, distinguished 
by the presence of hats upon their heads. The hulls of the second, 
third, and right-hand figures are in imitation of 
the native made vessel of that size, which is 
adapted to the erection of masts and small sails. 
The artist has evidently intended to represent 
the different varieties used by him or his family. 
In fig. 29 are represented two vessels, under 
full sail, within reasonable distance from shore, 
as is indicated by the presence of two pines which loom up in the mid- 
dle distance. No special motive appears to have prompted the delinea- 
tion of the ships, excepting perhaps the record of an unusual event 
in the history of the locality where it is supposed to have occurred. 

The portrayal of a schooner (fig. 30) 
is perhaps only the result of "having 
nothing better to do," as loungers often 
whittle or engrave figures or outlines 
of such things that create passing in- 
terest. It is probable too that some- 
thing of greater interest may have been 

connected with the arrival of a vessel from civilization. This, however, 
could only be cleared up by the artist himself or the i)erson for whom it 
may have been drawn. 
In like manner, the illustration shown in fig. 31 may have been 

engraved because of some

f~ event of consequence con-

because of the peculiar ap- 
pearance in the Alaska waters 
of a vessel with but one wheel, and that at the stern. Such vessels are 
common on inland waters of the United States, but their seldom occur- 
rence so far north may have been deemed of sutficient importance of 
which to make a permanent record. 



798 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

A crude or unflnislied umiak with four occupants is shown in fig. 32. 
The bodies are not indicated; the heads, arms, and oars being incised. 
The umiak itself is well drawn, but with mast or rigging erected. 

Further reference to vessels, both as to pictographic variants and in 
relation to conveyance by this means, will be made farther on in con- 
nection with conveyance and domestic avocations. 

REPRESENTATION BY SYNECDOCHE. 

The representation of part of an object to represent the whole, or vice 
versa, is not so common in the etchings of the Eskimo as in the picto- 
graphs of the Indians. 

In many instances in the ornamented ivory records, parts of animal 
or other forms are portrayed in this manner, and such abbreviated 
characters are subsequently utilized and arranged in such order so as 
to serve the purpose of simple ornamentation, the primary object or 
concept having but little if any further connection in its new x^osition. 

Mr. L. M. Turner 1 informs me that "the marginal engravures, 
resembling the tail of a whale, are intended to represent the number 
of white whales [BelphinapteriiH catodon (Linnjcus) Gill.] the owner (or 
maker) of the ivory article has personally killed or taken in a net. 

Fig. 33. 

ESKIMO HUNTER AND HERD OF REINDEER. 

There are, sometimes, partnership pursuits of these whales (as well as 
other creatures), and by mutual agreement the quarry falls to him who 
first struck, killed, or otherwise would have secured the whales." 

The spears which are x)ortrayed upon some of the engravings of 
natives in kaiaks are j)laced so as to be upon a rest, similar to that 
shown in plate 29, in order that they may be quickly grasped for use. 
These rests are made of ivory, and in many instances are decorated. 
The specimen herewith reproduced is from Point Barrow, where it was 
obtained by Lieutenant P. H. Eay, U. S. A., and by him sent to the 
IS^ational Museum. 

The entire length of the specimen is 8| inches, the distance across 
the horns being 4^ inches, and across the base, just beneath the figures 
of the whales' tails, 2^ inches. 

The tails denote the owner to have been a whale hunter. The top of 
the horns is fashioned in imitation of a whale's head, the long-curved 
mouth being carefully indicated, while blue beads are inserted to indi- 
cate the eyes. Upon the outer edge of each horn, corresponding to 
the back of the whale, is a cross, in the middle of which is a blue 
bead. The four loops of thong are for attachment to the boat.

111 the illustration shown in figure 33, the idea of many and much is 
expressed in the same line of thought or conception as in gesture lan- 
guage. The herd of animals, instead of being indicated by drawing 
the bodies of those in the foreground singly and comi^lete, and only 
parts of those beyond being perceivable to the beholder, is represented, 
with one individual exception, by a single figure of a long body, the 
thirteen heads being subsequently placed at proper intervals above it, 
while a certain, though deficient, number of legs and feet are drawn 
beneath and extending to the ground. These are all drawn as if escap- 
ing from the hunter. 

At the extreme end of the engraving is the representation of a 
hunter, armed with bow, and indications of arrows. Parts of the figure 
have become obliterated by frequent use of the ivory drill bow. The 
deer next to the hunter does not face in an opposite direction, as if 
escaping, but is drawn with the head lowered and directed toward him. 
The attitude has perhaps no special signification, further than that 
this deer was secured by being shot with an arrow, whereas the 
remainder of the herd which the hunter saw escaped. Compare also 
figure of herds in plate 65, fig. 4. 

Plate 21, fig. 3, represents the convex side of a drill bow, on the right 
half of which are thirty transverse figures representing that number 
of wolf pelts. To the right is one otter skin and the outlines of ten 
bearskins. As will be observed, these figures are deeply cut and rather 
conventionalized. The great amount of coloring matter and deep inci- 
sions represent the bold, strong work, characteristic of the natives of 
Kotzebue Sound. The lateral edges are ornamented with parallel 
longitudinal lines. 

The regular order of the outline of pelts and hides is perhaps not only 
illustrative of the great number of animals killed, but the regularity and 
repetition of sjiecific parts of the animal's body, and the concavity of 
the sides of the bears' skins, is a tendency toward conventionalizing. 
On the whole, the record is a good illustration of synecdoche. 

As there will be occasion to refer to another curious subject in pictog- 
raphy — the transmission of special characters, or the utilization of 
native symbolic characters to serve as substitutes to replace imported 
or intrusive forms — it may not be amiss to refer in this connection 
to the interesting result noted in British coins, in which the native 
Britons copied the obverse and reverse engravings which they found 
upon the gold stater of Philip of Macedon. The coins were introduced 
into the country of the littoral tribes through traffic with the Gauls, 
while the latter obtained possession of them after Greece was plundered 
by Brennus, B. C. 279. 

The reverse of the typical stater bears a charioteer in a biga, the 
two horses in the attitude of running, while behind is the outline of a 
wheel, usually elliptical, as the space was not sufficiently large to permit 
a circle as large as the extreme length of the ellipse to be recorded. 



800 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The Britons in adopting the design for tlieir native coins, and being 
perhaps — I may suggest the word certainly — unacquainted with the 
form, or use, of the chariot, and the signification of other characters 
and figures found upon the Greek prototype, reproduced in their suc- 
cessive issues and recoinings variations in these foreign characters, or 
replaced them by symbols with which they were acquainted and of 
which they comprehended the signification. 

In many of the British coins the horses are reduced to a single 
animal, though with legs sufficient for two, clearly representing the 
pair by synecdoche, exactly as our Korth American Indian does in his 
records of personal or tribal engagements with the enemy. 

Illustrations relating to this peculiarity on the coins named, together 
with the substitution of native and familiar characters and symbols 
for those of foreign and unknown types, will be presented farther on.^ 

DECORATION AND ORNAMENTATION. 

The importation into Alaska and the adoption by the natives of art 
designs which are foreign to their own does not appear at all impossible, 
and the subject is one which would seem to ofter an interesting field for 
investigation with a reasonable hope of interesting developments. 

With respect to the probability of the transmission of such art work, 
Mr. Hadden,^ whom I have before quoted, remarks: 

As decorated objects must be conveyed by man, the means for their dispersal and 
the barriers which militate against it are the same as those which operate on human 
migrations; but there is one difference. Where men go we may assume that they 
carry their artistic efforts and proclivities with them, but decorated objects may be 
carried farther than the actual distance covered by the manufacturer, or even than 
the recognized middleman or trader. 

This brings us to a very important subject, and that is the question of trade routes. 
Trade routes are culture routes; and in order to appreciate the history of culture, it 
is necessary to know the directions in which it flowed. Until we have a more com- 
plete knowledge of the ancient trade routes of Europe, we can not recover the history 
of the prehistoric Europe. 

This subject is now beginning to receive great attention in the Old 
World, and some highly interesting and valuable facts have been 
brought to light. 

In North America the study of prehistoric trade routes, or culture 
routes, has thus far received but a limited amount of careful attention; 
but some instances of curious results of intertribal traffic have been 
observed. Frequently designs of a specific character, such as may be 
termed peculiar to a special tribe, are carried to remote localities and 
there adopted by other tribes of an entirely different linguistic family, 
whereas the same design or pattern of the former may not produce the 
slightest apparent effect upon the recognized art designs or ornamenta-

tioii of an adjoining body of peoi)le of a like linguistic family and with 
whom there may be frequent social intercourse. This is'accounted for 
in the instances in mind because of the absence of like materials and 
resources quite necessary for a faithful imitation of the imported i)at- 
tern, the original being fully recognized as a cult symbol, and any 
alteration however slight would immediately provoke the anger of the 
gods. Therefore, a remote body of people whose ciilt beliefs are difi'er- 
ent, and who would i^erhaps not recognize the sacred or mystic import 
of a symbol, might readily and without any hesitation adopt such pat- 
tern as might suit one's fancy and subsequently alter it to conform to 
the shape of the material upon which it would be imposed by incision, 
impressed in color, or otherwise. 

The northwest coast of America, between Puget Sound and Kadiak, 
is an excellent illustration of a culture route, and the arts of the vari- 
ous Selish tribes are traceable over a wide area. The peculiar designs of 
the Haida, both in sculpture and in tattooing, have been gradually car- 
ried northward into the territory of the Thlinkits, the Kadiak, and have 
been even recently adopted, to a limited extent, by the Aigalu'^amut 
and Kiate'xamut Eskimo of southern Alaska. 

The original patterns of the Eskimo, such as the line^ dots, and 
herring-bone patterns, do not seem to prevail against the rounded and 
curved figures and designs of the Haida art. The origin of the latter 
is peculiar, and the alleged development, if not the introduction and 
adoption, of the elaborate system of tattooing since about the year 1833, 
certainly otters an interesting field for critical research.^ 

The Haida i^atterns, as has been intimated, are very different in both 
design and concept as compared with the artistic work of the Eskimo. 
Both are peculiar to the regions in which they flourish, and no resem- 
blance whatever is ai^parent. The Haida designs originate chiefly in 
totemic, mythologic, and cult forms, which have, iu many instances, 
become so highly conventionalized as to become difficult of identifica- 
tion. The Eskimo art embraces chiefly an attempt at personal and 
family records of hunting exploits, with occasional ceremonials por- 
trayed in little more than simple pictorial form, but there is present an 
exhibition of the progress of recording both gestures and signals, to 
aid in the explanation of the record, as well as frequent attempts at 
the record of subjective ideas, a system of pictography foreign to that 
of the Haida, and more nearly approaching the j)etroglyi)hs of various 
tribes belonging to the Shoshonian linguistic family, conspicuous among 
which are some of the pueblos of i^ew Mexico and Arizona; and the 
Bculpturings found in Owens Valley, California, the authors of which 
are unknown but are believed to have been members of the same family, 
both because of the typical resemblance of many of the patterns and 
the geographic location of the sculptured bowlders.

802 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Another trade route of importance in this connection is that afforded 
by the waters of the Yukon River. Eskimo patterns have been car- 
ried up into the country of the Kenai Indians, a tribe usually designated 
in the northwest as the Tenauah, and of the same linguistic relation- 
ship as the Apache, the Navajo, and among many others the Hupa 
Indians of California. These designs are made up of straight lines, 
dots, and nucleated circles, and occur upon strips of bone with perfora- 
tions at one end, and used, it is presumed, as necklace ornaments. 
Similar ornaments are found also among the Thlinkit, of which illus- 
trations are given on plate 9. 

In the National Museum is an interesting relic made of horn, used 
as a cylindrical box for dentalium shell money, upon which are incised 
and blackened lines so arranged between two parallel longitudinal 
lines that the original white surface of the specimen is a serrated figure 
and not the ordinary zigzag, plate 30. Although the resemblance of 
this to some of the zigzag and meander patterns of the Eskimo is very 
striking, no connection can be apparently traced between the two i)eo- 
ples, even along the supposed course of migration of the Ilupa toward 
the coast at the time of the separations of the Apache or Athabascan 
tribes, vivid traditions of which still obtain among the Apaches, and 
linguistic evidence of which is complete. 

A well-known trade or culture route — in fact, one of the earliest to 
influence the crude arts of the Eskimo — was by way of the Diomedo 
Islands, when the natives came in contact with the Cossack outposts in 
eastern Siberia.^ 

The traffic which naturally resulted brought among the American 
natives various articles of Ilussian manufacture, among which, no 
doubt, were ikons and other Christian and ecclesiastical objects and 
prints, articles which are usually found to be highly decorated in both 
design and color. Such objects would most naturally tend to influence 
the simple art of a people who were naturally given to the ornamenta- 
tion of various utensils and weapons, as also of articles of clothing. 

Through this channel were obtained, so Mr. Murdoch informs me, 
the Siberian pipes and seal nets, which, together with the native labret, 
have extended eastward of Point Barrow to Cape Bathurst, beyond 
which locality,it is believed, neither are found. This blank area between 
Cape Bathurst and the delta of the Mackenzie forms a barrier, or line 
of demarcation, beyond which the several bodies of Eskimo are artis- 
tically distinct from one another. In other words, the three objects 
named as common to the Alaskan Eskimo are totally absent east of the 
locality indicated, as found by Mr. Murdoch during his residence at 
the Point. 

Mr. Haddon^ remarks that although decorated objects pass along

trade routes "and are distributed far and wide, it does not always nec- 
essarily follow that the ornamentation itself is naturalized. It is pos- 
sible that in many cases a certain style of decoration is associated with 
a particular kind of object, and it migiit not occur to people to transfer 
tbat decorative style to other objects, or at all events the process would 
doubtless be slow." 

An interesting example of bone dress ornaments, bearing simple 
decorations and common to both the eastern Eskimo and the Nascopi, 
as well as the now extinct Beothuk Indians of Newfoundland, was 
brought to my attention by Professor O. T. Mason, Curator of Ethnology 
in the National Museum. 

The specimens are reproduced in colored and plain sketches, and 
presented to the National Museum by Lady Blake, of the Government 
House, St. Johns, Newfoundland. 

The illustrations represent the primitive bone ornaments worn about 
the bottom of dresses prior to the use of metal substitutes, such as are 
now attainable from the whites. These ornaments are chiefly of a class 
which represent an inverted narrow letter V — thus, A — each about 2 
or 2i inches in length and decorated with various angular designs. 
Some of them have marginal incised lines, within wliich and attached 
thereto are the base of triangular or serrated markings similar to 
some Eskimo patterns, shown in various illustrations. 

Upon the ends of some other small horn ornaments are similar rude 
zigzag patterns, as shown in other illustrations of Eskimo workman- 
ship. 

The information is obtainable as to the conceptions which gave rise 
to the art patterns of the Beothuk. The simple zigzag may have 
resulted from an incised imitation of some notched ornaments made by 
Nascopi, ornaments such as the Beothuk were undoubtedly familiar 
with, as both varieties are shown upon the same plates of illustrations 
made by Lady Blake. By laying the Nascopi ornament upon the slab 
of horn used by the Beothuk, the incised serrations forming the border 
almost exactly fit to the zigzag or serrated ornamentation forming a 
border near the edge of the piece used by the latter. 

Several patterns occur in p]skimo decorations, however, which, while 
not exactly resembling patterns from other parts of the world, appear 
to have originated with them, and were suggested to them by original 
products or mechanical contrivances, as the Siberian kantag or wooden 
buckets, in nests of several sizes, and the peculiar fish trap or run 
placed in narrow channels of water, and perhaps the guides to the pit- 
fall. To the latter class of ornamentation may be placed the "seal- 
tooth" pattern. These two different types of objects may have 
suggested the motive for the figure of concentric circles and the rude 
zigzag, respectively; or the introduction from Avithout the territory of 
the Eskimo of these designs— the former, for instance, through the infiu- 
ence of the Eussians, and the other, perhaps, from the vicinity of 



S04 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Torres Straits ami adjaceut territory — may have been seized upou as 
suocresting the outlines or eoueepts i^eroeived in tlie uative products, 
the possible dtftereuce iu artistic results being dependent upou the 
difference in material upon which the designs are portrayed aud to the 
expertness or lack of skill of the Eskimo copyist or artist. 

Upon a careful examination of all available materials bearing pic- 
torial records or only simple decorative designs, several interesting 
facts appear. 

First. That the Eskimo east of Point Barrow, including those even 
of Labrador and Greenland, exhibit but little artistic expression, this 
being confined chiefly to lines, dots, aud other similar rudimentary 
markings which are employed almost wholly for decorative purposes. 
This does not refer to various kinds of carvings and outlined flat fig- 
ures in bone or ivory, which are intended to be stitched to clothing, a 
custom very much resembling a like practice which obtains in Finland. 
jS'either does this refer to the custom of stamping designs upon cloth 
or buckskin, a practice apparently learned from the several Algonkian 
tribes with which some of the Hudson Bay and Labrador tribes of 
Eskimo come in contact. 

Second. That the Point Barrow natives are apparently but moder- 
ately advanced in the art of recording tribal or individual events, cus- 
toms, etc., and that most of thek ivory utensils are not decorated: but 
that where attempts at beautifying are apparent, only those designs 
are adopted which suggest or require the least amount of manual exer- 
tion and artistic ability, so that straight incisions, creases, or grooves 
are most numerous, while nucleated circles, and rarely also a few con- 
centric rings, are incised, the latter apparently by means of the common 
carpenters auger bit, properly filed at the cutting edge so as to pro- 
duce a scratch instead of an incision, the latter being too delicate and 
tedious a process for success in removing the dense resisting particles 
of ivory. 

Third. That the engravings on ivory and bone from the northern 
portion of the west coast of Alaska, embracing the region about Kotze- 
bue Soimd and northward, and inchtding Diomede Islands and the 
opposing coast, as well as the area occupied by the Asiatic Eskimo, are 
more deeply and crudely cut, as indicated by the lines being broader 
and bolder than in the products from any other area. 

Fourth. That the general results in graphic portrayals are more artis- 
tic among the natives of Bristol Bay and Xorton Sound, and improve 
in delicacy of engraving toward the southward even to and including 
the Aleutian Islands: that the portrayal of animal forms is accom 
plished with such fidelity as to permit of specific identification; that 
the attempt at reproducing graphically common gesture signs becomes 
more frequent, and various instances of the successful portrayal of 
subjective ideas also occur.

Wooden Tablet. Papuan Ornamentation. 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 805 

Cape Avinotf nearly to Cape Komauzoff, Mr. Dall ' remarks that they 
have been reported as remarkable for the beauty of their workman- 
ship in ivory. "A kantag or wooden dish," he continues, "which was 
obtained at Xviuivak by Captaiu Smith, was neatly carved and inlaid 
with lozenges of white stone resembling gypsum. They were labrets 
of the same material. Their food was i)rincipally fish and seal, and 
they appeared to be very destitute of iron and other articles intro- 
duced by traders. Their ivory weapons were of great beauty, and 
some specimens of hollow carving would tax the resources of the most 
skillful civilized workman to equal.'' 

In addition to the above named facts there occur other peculiar pat- 
terns, two of which are of interest; they are respectively the figures of 
concentric circles, and a Papuan-like zigzag design, to which reference 
has already been made. The former is frequently a nucleated circle, 
frequently regularly incised series of circles one beyond the other, and 
occasional instances in which delicate radiating lines are attached to 
the outer ring. 

The other pattern is like, and yet unlike, that found in Pai)uan 
decorations, in which is a rude wavy or meander zigzag, or even more 
sharply defined interdigital lines, or perhaps even triangular projec- 
tions so as to form true serrations, resulting in what is sometimes 
termed a tooth pattern. 

This particular form of Papuan art is usually drawn between or 
within parallel lines, and extends transversely across the specimen 
decorated. The Eskimo resemblances, if they may be so termed, are 
represented on plate 31, figs. 2, 4, and 5. 

Plate 32, fig. -1, re[)resents an Eskimo comb, the curves upon which 
form an interesting example for comparison with the Papuan designs 
upon a tablet of wood, referred to and illustrated by Mr. Stolpe, of 
Stockholm.^ Plate 33. 

Similar parallel lines carrying between them the same style of a 
rude zigzag, but in relief, because the alternate triangular spaces have 
been removed by cutting, occur upon various other specimens repre- 
sented in various plates and illustrations. 

The short transverse bars in this type of pattern represent in 
some instances, according to an Alaskan informant and pictographer, 
Vladimir ISTaomofF, conventionalized fish traps, su(;h as are placed in 
narrow channels of water for catching the migrating salmon. A sym- 
metrical trap of such construction is shown on the faces of a pipe in 
plate 60. The transverse lines or bars are complete in this illustra- 
tion, however, yet the decorative or evolved figure is easily traceable 
to the original. A simpler form of the same pattern appears in the 
decoration on fig. 4 in plate 31, where the alternate short lines project 
inward toward the opposing space between the short lines.

806 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The native drawings of the so-called fish trap or seal tooth pattern 
also resemble the approaches to the game trap or inclosure, both 
these contrivances being represented by horizontal or oblique or per- 
haps even only parallel lines, leading to a trap or inclosure, along 
which lines are short etchings or bars to denote the posts or divisions 
to sustain the brush of the game drive or the wickerwork partitions of 
the fish trap. These short lateral lines simulate the drawings made to 
denote the separations or spaces between teeth like those of the seal, 
of which examples are given in fig. 00, and, as was suggested by a 
native Eskimo, the open mouth of the hunting seal was like the open 
fish trap and game drive, ready to take in such prey as came within 
reach. The conception of the design may be found in the trap, as 
suggested by ISTaomoff, or in the "seal's mouth," as suggested by 
Nomiksener, a Kaviagmut Eskimo from Port Clarence, whose ])or- 
trait is shown in plate 2. 

These drawings in ivory are usually placed between horizontal or 
parallel lines, interesting because they resemble the chief character- 
istics of Celtic art, of which there is no relationship directly except 
as showing the like workings of man's mind under like conditions. 
"The Japanese, for instance," says a writer in Archa^ologia Cambrensis,^ 
"ignore the margin altogether and make their decoration entirely 
independent of it, but in Celtic art tlie patterns are all designed to 
suit the shape of the margin." This is true of much of the Alaskan art. 

The early contact by the Alaskans with art products from the South 
Pacific is believed to be pretty generally recognized; and an instance 
of the discovery among the natives of Bristol Bay of the cocoanut 
suggested an admirable material for engraving which was only sur- 
passed in beauty and texture by walrus ivory. Various curios have 
also been carried north by sailors, the carvings upon which have sug- 
gested, no doubt, possibilities in engraving of Avhich the Eskimo had 
previously had no concejition. Illustrated newspapers are seized with 
avidity, and reproductions of various cuts attempted, in some known 
instances the features of faces being fairly truthful likenesses. 

Much of the art of the Eskimo has been influenced, too, by the intro- 
duction of articles of Russian manufacture, of which more is remarked 
elsewhere. Two fairly good examples of native workmanship of this 
are given on plate 34, figs. 1 and 2, and representing wooden boxes 
with native ornamentation and Eussian symbols of the cross and other 
motifs. 

The suggestion for engraving concentric circles being accounted for 
as to origin and signification by Mr. L. M. Turner, and described farther 
on, may also have been introduced through the medium of sailors and 
others from the Gulf of Papua, where, according to Mr. Haddon, they 
are conventionalized eyes in the ornamental faces carved on wooden 
belts.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS, 807 

In Alaska, however, concentric circles and nucleated rings have been 
utilized to explain concepts other than the similar patterns which occur 
elsewhere in the world, referring to other widely distinct origins and 
concepts. (Compare with variants on plate 17.) 

The concentric rings, being so generally widespread, survive in the 
Kongo region and in Tangier, where the design may owe its origin to 
the introduction of Mohammedanism and the Byzantine style of orna- 
mentation; upon Eoman lamps in the ruined church of St. Louis, in 
Carthage; and in numerous localities throughout northern Europe as 
rock sculpturings, and in bronze and other jewelry and ornaments. 
America has many petroglyphs in which this design is found, the 
greatest number being upon the basalt rocks in the arid desert south 
of Benton, Owens A^ alley, California. 

By these references to the occurrence in widely separated localities 
of like designs, I do not for a single moment desire to convey the 
impression that the belief is entertained that this is the result of 
migration through the ordinary trade, or culture channels, as Mr. 
Haddon designates them, but rather of independent development, 
being evolved from very diverse originals and concepts. It is certain, 
nevertheless, that in some instances religious symbols are carried 
among peoples to whom they are artistically or technically foreign, and 
to whom the signification would be meaningless but for the exidanation 
accompanying them. 

In Alaska several different versions are given to account for the 
origin of the nucleated circles, plain concentric rings, and rings with 
dentations. Eeference to like forms in other regions is made elsewhere. 

Mr. Iladdon' remarks with reference to such figures that "there is a 
great tendency for spirals to degenerate into concentric circles; exam- 
ples could be given from New Guinea, America, Europe, and elsewhere. 
In fact, one usually finds the two figures associated together, and the 
sequence is one of decadence, never the evolution of spirals from cir- 
cles. The intermediate stage has been aptly termed a 'bastard spiral' 
by Doctor Montelius — 'that is to say, concentric circles to which the 
recurved junction lines give, to a casual glance, the appearance of true 
spirals.'" 

Interesting instances in support of Mr. Haddon's statement are found 
in the development of decorative designs among various tribes of 
Indians, in which the textile designs were ultimately imitated in a 
free hand style, thus gradually converting the angular into curved 
figures, as in the meander patterns so common in the basketry and 
pottery designs of the several pueblo tribes. 

In northern Europe and elsewhere in the Old World coils of withes, 
cords, and other textile strands were imitated in metal, as may be seen 
in many of the prehistoric relics of Scandinavia and France. 

Associated with these patterns are series of figures consisting of 



' "Evolutiou in Art," p. 93. 



808 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

concentric rings, which no doubt owe their origin to the vegetal 
prototype. 

Thus far no spirals have been observed in the native art designs of 
the Eskimo as illustrated in the National Museum, and one reason for 
the absence of sj)irals may be attributed to the difficulty of engrav- 
ing the ivory satisfactorily, or perhaps to tlie absence of particular life 
forms which might under other circumstan(;es suggest such motifs. 
The general shape of the spaces upon drill bows, being long and 
narrow, would otberwise naturally suggest either a meander or a 
continuous series of squids as a most appropriate and convenient 
pattern. Instead of these, however, the ornamental "filling-in" 
consists of straight lines of various lengths and at various angles, 
together with animal or bird forms in various stages of abbreviation 
through conventionalization. 

DECORATION CONSISTING CHIKFLY OF LINES, DOTS, AND ZIGZAGS. 

The older forms of ornamentation, as already indicated, seem to 
consist of straight lines, dots, and <-shaped incisions, while the appar- 
ently later ones are the circles, made by metal instruments possil)ly of 
native workmanship, and the rude zigzag or meander. The applica 
tion of these several types of designs to the ornau^entation of various 
articles of use is represented in the next few pages. Some interestinji 
examples of figure carving, bearing engravings of various types, arc 
also reproduced. 

While the rude zigzag pattern is frequently alluded to as the "fish 
trap" pattern — the name being deemed appropriate because the type 
originated in that contrivance, according to Naomoft' — the designation 
"seal tooth" pattern might be equally appropriate, as the arrangement 
of the teeth and spaces between them may have suggested the pattern 
among tribes in other parts of the Eskimo territory, 

Plate 35, fig. 8, shows a woman's skin scraper, from Cape Darby. 
The specimen appears to be made of fossil ivory and is carved in imi- 
tation of a whale's tail, and rounded so as to fit the palm of the hand. 
The front end has a deep incision, in which was placed at one time a 
flint scraper, in imitation of other examples in the collection of the 
National Museum. The specimen bears beneath a depression, show- 
ing it to have been used for holding the top of a drill. The ornamen- 
tation on both sides and transversely at the rear portion consists of a 
single line to which are attached irregular short radiating or transverse 
lines in imitation of the rudest type of the "fish trap" pattern. This 
ornamentation is in accordance with the typical ornamentation of the 
Eskimo, such as comes from the shell heaps of the Aleutian Islands, 
across to the east coast of Greenland, and antedating very likely the 
historic period. 

In plate 31, fig. 5, is shown an ivory bodkin, here reproduced as of 
interest in presenting upon the one side five parallel lines of unequal

length, between whicli are the short lateral lines and zigzag, showing 
the method of engraving and the artistic evolution of the pattern. 

Plate 30, figs, 1-4, represent kantag handles. The specimen shown 
in fig. 1 is from Sledge Island, and is ornamented by two parallel longi- 
tudinal lines between which are cross lines by threes at intervals of 
about an inch. In fig. 2 the sets of cross lines are by twos, but on the 
inner side, facing one another, are short lines, as in the ornamental 
pattern before referred to as the fish traj) or seal tooth, giving rise 
ultimately to the zigzag. In fig. 3 is represented a handle, upon the 
upper side of which the ornamentation consists of ten whales in relief, 
while upon the under side is a very neatly engraved mammal of the 
same species, though extending horizontally instead of transversely. 

In fig. 4 the upper side represents two horizontal lines with the short 
lines extending inward between their opposing fellows, a sort of inter- 
digitation, the interior spaces representing a rude zigzag with the outer 
angles being removed instead of being shaped to a point, as in the true 
zigzag. 

In the next illustration of a bag handle, plate 31, fig. 4, are tln^ee 
parallel lines extending from end to end. From the outer lines inward 
are short lines at intervals of perhaps ^ of an inch, while extending to 
either side from the central line are similar short lines extending out- 
ward so as to project between the short lines from without — a sort of 
interdigitation, resulting in a double row of the "fish trap" pattern or 
rude zigzag presented in so many of the illustrations. 

Fig. 2 of the same plate also bears a series of like ornamentation, the 
concept perhaps also being found in the fish trap. 

Plate 37, fig. 3, represents a bow, one end of which terminates in an 
animal's head, while about the neck, the middle, and the rear end are 
parallel lines, from the inner side of which and approaching the oppo- 
site side are small triangular points so arranged alternately from one 
side to the other as to leave an intervening space in the form of zigzag. 
This design is very common on work from several particular localities. 
It is used as an ornament in filling out blank spaces, as in the illustra- 
tion (fig. 6 on the same plate, 37), where it serves to decorate seals' 
skins, seventeen of them being placed in a row. This may be compared 
with like illustrations in connection with conventionalizing. 

Plate 31, fig. 1, represents a bag handle, locality unknown, upon 
which is showii a pattern consisting primarily of a central incision 
extending from end to end, from which radiate toward either side sev- 
eral series of diagonal lines, which appear to be similar in type to that 
shown in plate 38, fig 1, and on plate 39, fig. 2. 

On plate 34, fig. 1, is a small wooden box obtained at Cape Nome. 
It has a sliding lid, while the two lower projections, resembling feet, 
are in reality the outlines of bears' heads. As will be noted, there are 
several outlines of flintlock guns shown upon the lid, besides other 
characters, while along the margin are short diagonal lines arranged 



810 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

ill tlie form of zigzags. A few Eussian letters are incised upon the 
sides, indicating the natives' knowledge of, or acquaintance with, char- 
acters of that language. 

In plate 34, fig. 2, is represented a box of almost the same form and 
from the same locality, the bottom being represented in the illustra- 
tion and upon it a variety of ornamentation very much in imitation of 
the patterns before mentioned and found on many of the specimens. 
Upon closer investigation, however, it will be observed that the mar- 
ginal lines bear between them small arrowheads or < -shaped figures, 
while in the remaining spaces the ornamentation consists of parallel 
lines, the intervening spaces being ornamented by short diagonal lines. 
The two lozenges in the middle bear upon the center a cross, evidently 
suggested by Russian ecclesiastical pictures or literature. 

Plate 37, fig. 1, is a plain white ivory bow drill from Point Hope. 
The ornamentation is visible in the illustration and consists simply of 
the wavy exterior produced by filing a series of indentations along the 
edge of the triangular bow. 

Plate 37, fig. 5, also from Point Barrow, shows two parallel lines 
extending from almost one end to the other, between which are diag- 
onal lines at short intervals. The bottom edge of the bow is indented 
at intervals of a little over an inch, leaving projections upon which 
small triangular figures extend from the bottom, presenting an orna- 
mental effect. The coloring matter apparently consists of red ocher. 

Plate 38, figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, represent bag handles from Norton Sound, 
St. Michaels, the Yucon River, and Point Hope, respectively. 

In plate 39, fig. 1, the ornamentation upon the upper side consists of a 
median horizontal line or crease terminating at one end with three per- 
forations, which number occurs also at the other end of the rod. At 
right angles to this median line, at either end, are eight nucleated rings. 
At the center of the specimen are a like number, in the middle of which 
grouj) is inserted a large blue glass bead. Upon the upper side, instead 
of a median line, the surface is filled with a continuous row of nucleated 
circles. Upon examination, however, it is observed thf^t the circles 
consist of two or three different sizes, showing that instruments of 
that number of sizes were used. The rings indicate, furthermore, that 
the tool was of hard metal, but no doubt fashioned by the artist, a 
narrow piece of steel having a crotch filed into the end so as to leave 
two sharp points. 

Plate 39, fig. 3, represents a very neat bag handle or bow drill nearly 
18 inches in length. The top is fluted longitudinally by means of three 
deep creases, while in the outer sides are a series of cavities or scal- 
lops, also ornamented along the margin by incisions. This specimen is 
interesting because of the great number of nucleated circles scattered 
along the under side. Each of these circles seems to have been made 
with the same instrument, which was apparently a carpenter's bit, 
one-fourth of an inch in diameter.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 811 

I Plate 39, fig. 4, represents a bag- handle marked with a single median 
line from which the specimen slopes toward either side of the outer 
edge, and it is also fashioned along the outer margin like the preceding 
one, though the curves or scallops are longer. Between each curve is 
a small V-shaped niche, while at the middle this is replaced by a short 
scallop or curve. 

The specimen represented in plate 30, fig. 2, is decorated upon the 
upper side by a median horizontal line, deeply engraved, to which are 
attached, by pairs, short diagonal lines exactly resembling the herring- 
bone pattern, each pair of these patterns being about one-half an inch 
from the succeeding i)air. Upon the lower or concave side is a similar 
median line, to one side of whicli are placed the figures of thirty-seven 
geese, or sknas, swimming toward the right. The ligures are as nearly 
alike as can be made by the average native artist, and are equidistant 
from one another. 

The regularity of the arrangement of these bird figures suggests that 
ornamentation was aimed at as well as a historic record.

Fig. 34 represents but two of tlie five panels or spaces decorated, 
both of which bear figures referring to canoes in which the men at the 
rear are armed with oars, while those at the bow have guns raised as if 
about to shoot. The partitions consist of transverse ornamental lines, 
an improvement over the pairs or sets of vertical plain incisions shown 
on the paneled record in plate 30, fig. -2. 

The serrated inner edges of the dividing lines, facing one another, 
resemble the conventional figures used to denote fish weirs, and appear 
in the present instance to have been used as ornaments. As before 
stated, the same pattern has been suggested, apparently, by the arrange- 
ment of the teeth of the seal, illustrations of which are of frequent 
occurrence in the collections of the National Museum. 

In fig. 35 is the rude outline of an ivory harp )on head, on which the 
teeth of the seal are deeply .icised, while in fig. 36 the pattern 
approaches more nearly the rude meander, between which and the true 
zigzag as made by the Eskimo there are constant gradations and 
blending of form. 

The native in ])late 40, bottom line, is following a herd of walrus. He 
is paddling with an ordinary one-bladed paddle, in front of which is 
the harpoon slightly elevated above the deck, and behind him is the

inflated seal-skin float, tlie rear end being bifurcated, showing the 
two flippers. Four cross-like characters denote flying birds. 

The regularity and sameness of the figures seem to denote an attempt 
at ornamentation as well as a hunting record. 

Plate 14, figs. 4, o, 6, and 7, show specimens made of reindeer antler, 
and are from Xorton Sound. The ornamentation is rude, and in all 
but one case consists of the representation of animals. In fig. 4 the 
design is of the "fish trap" pattern, with a median line and short 
alternate radiating incisions, the spaces being occupied by crosses, 
probably the simplest and rudest form of ornamentation excepting the 

simple straight line. At one end 
appears to be an indication of eyes 
and nostrils, but there is not suf- 
ficient marking to indicate whether 
this was intended for otter or seal. 
^s-^^- The accompanying illustration, 

fig. 37, represents a tool the use of 
which is not known. '' It has a point like a graver," says Mr. Murdocli, 
"and is made of reindeer antler, ornamented with a pattern of incised 
lines and bands, colored with red ocher, and was perhaps a marline 
spike for working with sinew cord." ^ 

Plate 41, fig. 5, shows a small ivory wedge, used in splitting small 
pieces of wood. The specimen bears upon one side a nucleated circle 
with two lateral radiating lines, different from the C(»nventional flower 
symbol, though resembling to some extent the circles and lines shown 
on plate 29, fig. 5. Along the upper edge are three parallel lines. 
From the outer ones, extending inward, are shown very short diagonal 
lines, being a rude imitation of some of the "fish trap" patterns. 

A general view of the specimen, taking note of the short curve over 
the circle to denote an eyebrow, would suggest 
the head of a bird, the parallel lines along the /' Y^¥^ V aT*^ 
lower left side very much resembling the mouth. Im ^ ^ * ^"^

series of parallel lines leaving three spaces, the 

central one consisting alternately of black and white squares, while 
the lateral spaces bear continuous rude meander or zigzag patterns. 
The latter are more neatly indicated by deeper incisions than usually 
found in ivory specimens. 

Plate 41, fig. 3, represents a bone guard, such as is placed over the 
bow of a kaiak to protect it against floating ice. The chief ornamenta- 
tion consists of three parallel lines extending along either side, within 
which is the rude meander pattern, while from the outer sides extends 
a sort of herringbone pattern.

to have served as a handle, as a small perforation in the middle seems 
to have heen made for the pnrpose of inserting a cord. The npi)er 
side or half of this ornament is decorated with zig/ag cross lines, while 
the lower has the herring-bone pattern, like the ornaments npon one 
side of the running figure in the preceding illustration, plate 41, fig. 3. 
Plate 41, fig. 6, represents a bodkin, and is elsewhere referred to with 
respect to ornamentation. 

DECORATION CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF CIRCLES. 

The several objects represented on plate 42 are variously ornamented 
in simple patterns. Fig. 1 is an ivory ear pendant, which is creased 
spirally from end to end by one continuous line. Fig. '2 represents a toy 
fish, upon which is incised the figure of a wolf, with another linear 
character somewhat resembling a crude representation of the same 
species. 

The hair ornament shown in fig. 3 on the same plate is decorated 
along the upper half by two jjairs of transverse parallel lines, between

which arc cross lines to resemble the common portraiture of a sus- 
pended seine net, as shown on plate 59, also in fig. 79 ou page 805. 

The spear guard shown in idate 4-!, fig. 4, bears a simple vertical line 
from which diverge, downward and on either side, three lines, between 
which are small punctures. This enlarged figure suggests a like origin 
as the ornamented line in the middle of fig. 0, the latter having for its 
conception, no doubt, the plant symbol mentioned and figured else- 
where, particularly in connection with plate 77, and in fig. 70, page 863. 
Compare also with fig. 11, on plate 77, and other types of circles repre- 
sented thereon, which occur upon various types of Eskimo utensils and 
ornaments. 

Plate 42, fig. 5, is a common hook made for use in suspending various 
household articles. 

In addition to the lateral diverging lines, the central one is absent, 
but in its stead a continuation of perforations from which radiate three 
incisions, made by means of a narrow saw or a sharp edged file. These 
incisions serve instead of the narrow or shallow creases noted on figs. 4 
and 5. Punctured spots are also added to serve as additional orna- 
ments. 



814 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The lower figure on plate 42, fig. 7, is an arrow straiglitener, made of 
ivory. Tlie lower longitudinal line has similar, tliougli more frequently 
recurring, lateral lines than on fig. 0, while the side bears a continuous 
row of nucleated circles, the central cup like perforations being unusu- 
ally large in comparison to the rings surrounding them, clearly indicat 
iug that a one-eighth-inch auger bit was used in their production, as 
a smaller instrument made specially for incising rings (as the V-shaixd 
cuts in the end of a piece of metal) would naturally have the two points 
equally pointed. (Compare plate 77.) 

The reverse of the side bearing the median line bears a similar inci 
sion from end to end, but the lateral, oblique, radiating lines are each 
between (me eighth and one-half inch in length, somewhat between the 
two sizes noted on plate 8. This is evidently without significance other i 
than that of ornamentation. 

In a private communication of recent date Mr. L. M. Turner informs 
me, with reference to the circle, that "this ornament is much more com- 
mon south of Bering Strait, where it is a conventionalized representa- 
tion of a flower.'' Mr. Murdoch' writes: 

Somo of the older implements in our collection, ornamented with this figure, may 
have been obtained 1»y trade from tbo southern natives, but the Point Barrow people 
certainly know how to make it, as there are a number of newly made articles in the 
collection thus ornamented. Unfortunately, we saw none of these objects in the proc- 
ess of manufacture, as they were made by the natives during odd moments of leisure, 
and at the time I did not realize the importance of finding out the process. No tool 
by which these figures could be made so accurately was ever offered for sale. 

Neither Mr. Turner nor Mr. Dall, both of whom, as is well known, spent long 
periods among the natives of the Yukon region, ever observed the process of mak- 
ing this- ornament. The latter, however, suggests that it is perhaps done with an 
improvised centerbit, made by sticking two iron points close together in the end 
of the handle. » * * Lines rarely represent any natural objects, but gen- 
erally form rather elegant conventional patterns, most commonly double or single 
borders, often joined by oblique cross lines or fringed with short, pointed parallel 
lines. * * * ^Yhile weapons are decorated only with conventional patterns, other 
implements of bone or ivory, especially those pertaining to the chase, like the seal 
drags, etc., are frequently carved into the shape of animals, as well as being orna- 
mented with conventional patterns. 

Mr. L. M. Turner says, furthermore : 

The circles which have smaller ones within represent the so-called "kantag" (a 
word of Siberian origin introduced by the Russians), or wooden vessels, manufac- 
tured by Indians and bartered with the Innuit for oil and sealskin bootsoles, etc. 
These "kantags" are sometimes traded in nests, i.e., various sizes, one within the 
other. (See figs. 4, 7, and 10, on plate 77.) 

Regarding the "circle figures," Mr. Turner^ remarks further : 

I know from information given by one of the best workers of bone and ivory, also 
pipe-bowls, in the Unaligmut (or Unalit) village, near St. Michaels, that the circle 
means a flower when it has dentations on the outer periphery, and some that were 
unfinished on an old much used handle for a kantag (wooden vessel) were also said 
by him to mean flowers.

Those circles also represent the arms; just why I do not know. Tlie spots over a 
dog's eyelid, usually brown iu color in the dog, are also called Tuq, and a dog thus 
marked is called Tuqoliq. The word refers to the dark colored portion of that 
region and has nothing to do with the orifice, hut when the circle is made thus 0, 
then it refers to the hole [spot] and the surrounding part. 

I have elsewhere shown how the circk;, or r;ither the sjjiral, may be 
drawn to denote mobility, as in the shonlder Joint of the lij;ure of a 
grasshopper to denote the Kahuatl symbol for Chapultepec.* The 
circle is also used on various figures of seals, and apparently denotes 
the shoulder Joint, as shown in harpoon head in the collection of the 
Mttseum (No. 43750). Further illustration of the conventional use of 
circles is given under the caption of Conventionalizing, with i^late 75. 

The employment of an iron or steel bit, evidence of which appears 
to have been one about three sixteenths of an inch in diameter, is shown 
upon a neatly-carved seal obtained in St. MichaeFs, here represented as 
the lower right-hand figure on plate 43, fig. 4. The specimen was used 
as a seal drag, two perforations beneath the reach communicating with a 
larger one at the lower part of the abdomen, through which the neces- 
sary cord was passed. These bit marks are in the form of decorative 
circles, the central holes being in each filled with a wooden ])eg, the 
eyes, though smaller, also being plugged with hard wood. 

Plate 37, fig. 4, represents a specimen of bag handle or drill bow 
from Point Barrow, showing a number of nucleated rings, only one 
nucleus being without the second outer ring, indicating that these 
circles are made with different instruments. 

Similar nucleated circles appear upon specimens from an entirely 
remote locality. In fig. 1 of the remaining specimens upon plate 43 we 
have a fetish made of hippopotamus tooth, secured by Mr. Dorsey 
Mohuu on the Lukuga River, in the Kongo State, Africa. The nuclei 
are probably one-eighth of an inch in depth, while the circle surround 
ing each one -fourth inch in diameter. The groove clearly indicates 
the use of a metal tool in every respect resembling the circles and 
res])ective central pits upon the ornamented drill bow shown in fig. 4 
on plate 37. 

The specimen referred to is an imitation of the human form, the head 
slightly bowed forward, the arms close to the body, with the hands 
reaching toward each other before the body. The body is represented 
as cut oft" a little below the umbilicus, and is scooped out below as if 
intended to be placed upon a rod. 

Another specimen, fig. 2, represents a hair dressing pin, from the same 
locality, 2f inches long, with a sharp point below, while the almost flat 
top or head is ornamented with five similar nucleated circles, each 
three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter. 

The remaining specimen, fig. 3, from the Lukuga River, Kongo State, 
Africa, is a slightly concave disk, bearing five series of concentiic

816 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

circles, the central perforation in the middle passing entirely through 
the piece of ivory, which at that point is three - fourths of an inch 
thick. The circles were also made with a metal tool, more likely of 
native manufacture, out of a piece of foreign iron or steel, the end 
of which was iiled A -shaped, as mentioned in connection with the 
instruments of the Eskimo. 

These African specimens, two made of hippopotamus teeth and one 
of ivory, are similar in texture to the materials employed by the 
Eskimo, and the process adopted practically the same because of such 
texture. 

These illustrations are here introduced not with the object of tracing 
the migration or transmission of a given pattern, but because of the 
interest naturally excited by the independent discovery of a process of 
workmanship found to have developed in such widely remote localities. 

In northern Africa the same form of circle, nucleated and as concen- 
tric rings, is very much employed for decorative purposes. What the 
original signification may have been it is now, perhai)s, impossible to 
determine, and it may be that in the two localities to be referred to 
below the designs were brought from Europe, and i)robably originally 
from the Ottoman Empire. 

On plate 44 is shown a leather, brass mounted knife sheath, at the 
upper end of which is a tolerably fair attempt at a figure consisting of 
concentric rings, while beneath it a series of rectangular figures within 
one another. The designs are produced by pressure from the under side, 
the patterns having been made before the i)iece of sheet metal was 
placed about the sheath. This example is from Tangier, in Morocco. 

From an antique subterranean chapel at Carthage was obtained, 
about fifteen years since, a collection of Christian lamps and other evi- 
dences of the secret profession of the then new faith, among the orna- 
mentation upon some of which relics are many symbols of Christianity 
and of monograms of the name of Jesus Christ, but the most interest- 
ing in the present connection is the recurrence of the very widespread 
figure of concentric rings, as also of squares or rectangular figures 
within one another, as will be observed upon the illustration of the 
Eoman lani}) in plate 45. 

This illustration is reproduced from an article by A. Delathe on 
Carthage I'antique chapelle Souterraine de la Colline de Saint- Louis.' 

Upon another lamp of the same general form, from the same locality, 
is a cross pattee, the arms of which are severed with nucleated and 
concentric rings, exactly like many of those upon Alaskan objects. 

The larger rings and square figures upon the lamp shown in plate 45 
resemble those upon the brass-ornamented Moorish knife sheath from 
Tangier, Morocco (plate 44), where it was secured by Lieutenant A. P. 
Niblack, U. tS. iT. The chief interest lies in the two designs near the

top — one a figure of rectangles within one another, and the other a 
figure of rude rings surrounding one another. 

It is strange that these two designs should be suggested upon the 
Roman lamp from Carthage, the latter of an early Christian period, 
and from the same quarter of Africa. It is probable that both designs 
may liave their origin in the peculiar Oriental patterns so fi^eely 
employed in Mohammedan countries, in some of Avhich they even ante- 
date the birth of Mohammed. The occurrence of like designs in Turk- 
estan is also mentioned, and their apparent absence in Hindustan, 
as illustrated by the collections in the National Museum, is rather 
remarkable. 

The delicate zigzag lines on the middle band of the sheath are appar- 
ently made in the same manner as like xiatterns on Polynesian weapons 
and ornaments, by pressing forward upon the tool, and at the same 
time rocking it from side to side, the lateral incised points being made 
as the lateral cutting edge is depressed, and again liberated when 
turning the tool toward the opjjosite side to make a similar mark. The 
work is performed rapidly, and may be crudely though similarly imi- 
tated by means of a very narrow chisel and a piece of hard wood. 

The recent discoveries in Egyi)t by Mr. Flinders-Petrie are of so 
high an interest to arclucology generally, that a brief reference thereto 
may be of interest, especially so because some of the pottery is deco- 
rated not only with figures of animals and birds, but a common decora- 
tive motive which represents "a long boat with two cabins, an ensign 
pole, and many oars; sometimes the figure of a man is added." A red 
ware, said to have been imported from the Mediterranean region, bears 
decorations of "dents de loup," flowers, and plants. 

Of great interest is the discovery of vessels bearing numerous 
figures of concentric circles, vases of ruder type than the lathe-made 
ceramics of the Egyptians, and recognized to be the workmanship of a 
foreign people. 

These intruders, the evidences of whose general culture, beliefs, aud funeral cus- 
toms show them to have been strangers in the Nile ^'alley. Not a single detail of 
their culture did they hold in common with the Egyptians. Moreover, their num- 
ber, which was found to have spread o\er a considerable portion of upper Egypt, 
from Abydos to Gebelen, over one hundred miles, whilst their influence was observ- 
able from Tenneh to Hieraconpolis, i. e., over three hundred and fifty miles, and 
absolute control of the region which they assumed and which is shown by the total 
absence of any object recalling Egyptian civilization, show them not only to have 
been invaders, but invaders who once had swept over the region and who, settling 
down, had lived there for a considerable i)eriod, borrowing little or nothing of the 
people whose land they occupied. ' 

In connection with the report made by Mrs. Cornelius Stevenson, 
whose words I have quoted. Doctor D. Gr. Brinton remarks that these 

'Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, Pa., XXXV 
18%. p. 57, Plate IV.

818 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

intruders were probably Libyans — tbat is, Berbers — the etlinograpby 
of wbicli stock has been a S])ecial study with him. Doctor Brinton 
remarks: " This identification, I believe, will finally be established. If 
we examine the configuration of the Nile Valley and its surroundings, 
no other theory is tenable, i)r()viding the Libyan stock extended that 
far south of the Mediterranean at a date 3000 B. C. We know they 
did, and much earlier^ from their very early presence in east Africa." 
It appears to be conclusively shown by Doctor Brinton's further argu- 
ments that the "new race" was of the Libyan stock. 

The origin of the concentric circles and other incised ornamentation 
as decorative motives on this pottery would seem to have come from 
the Mediterranean, perhaps north of it, where a near ai^proach is found 
in later Neolithic stations in Itaiy, Spain, and in the lower strata of 
Hasserlik. Could there have been a prehistoric common center of 
development of this very common ornament in northwestern Europe, 
from which it was carried into Scandinavia, and the valleys of certain 
portions of France, where its occurrence is so frequently remarked in 
bronze and other articles of personal adornment? 

It has been shown that trade routes existed in prehistoric times 
between Italy and the Scandinavian Peninsula and Denmark, the scat- 
tered graves en route producing amber for one side and ornaments of 
south European manufacture on the other. Similar trade routes, which 
were also culture routes, have also been suggested as having existed 
between Scandinavia across northern Europe and Asia down into India. 
Why could not like routes have been followed in prehistoric times along 
the lines of the localities producing so much jewelry and fictile ware 
chiefly ornamented with spirals and concentric rings'? 

That trade routes existed between the countries of the Mediterra- 
nean, even as far east as Macedonia, has been well established, and 
the following remarks are of interest in this connection: 

In the June number of "The Strand Magazine"^ appeared an illus- 
trated article devoted to finds of coins in Great Britain, one illustration 
in particular attracting my attention because of the jiresence upon the 
reverse of a nucleated ring, which character in this connection ai^pears 
to have no ai)parent relation with the other objects represented ui)on 
the coin and with which it is associated. 

Upon reference to the various works on the coinage of the ancient 
Britons, several curious, interesting, and apparently new facts present 
themselves — facts which may with propriety be here referred to. The 
subject seems to me to be closely related to that under consideration in 
so far as it relates to trade or culture routes, and the adoption of char- 
acters by a people with whose signification or import they may be unac- 
quainted, and the ultimate replacement of such characters which may 
be of importance in and a necessary part of the prototype, by the sub-

stitution of tlieir own characters or symbols, tlirouj^h whicli change the 
sigiiificatiou of the legeud upon the i)rototyi)e is lost, and Mould uo 
longer be recognized by the authors thereof. 

I have already referred to the coinage of the Ihitons, as treated in 
the admirable work of Doctor John Evans,' to which the reader is 
referred for full details and ample illustrations in support ol' the sug- 
gestions ventured below. 

I have had occasion to refer to British coins bearing the figure of the 
horse, with additional legs to denote that more than one such animal 
was intended. Such practice of representing a part for the whole, or 
vice versa, was referred to as synecdoche, and as being common to the 
pictographic records of the North American Indians. 

On plate 43, fig. 'A, is the representation of an uniuscribed British 
gold coin, upon the reverse ot which appears the outline of a horse, 
each leg divided into two, so as to resemble — in fact, give — eight legs, 
and suggesting the two horses noticeable upon the obverse of the typical 
prototype, as shown in fig. 1 on the same plate. Now, looking at the 
legs of the horse on the reverse of fig. _, there will be seen the same 
number of legs, with the exception that the engraver of this piece has 
united each pair at the fetlocks, so as to terminate in one hoof, instead 
of two hoofs, as in some other examples. 

In the specimens of the same series of coins the successive copying 
of designs has resulted in solid legs instead of by pairs, thus returning 
to a pattern on which but a single animal is portrayed. 

But to return from this digression. It is necessary to show how the 
original patterns came to be employed by the designers for the British

Hawkins, and others, that the ancient Britons were i)0ssessed of money 
long before the time of Cnesar's visit. The distinct mention of money

yet they are interesting as showing a certain degree of evolution and alteration of 
characters which the engravers copied or attempted to copy from the prototypes.

occurs in various classic writings of the time of Ca'sar, and yearly trib- 
ute is noted by Dion Oassius, Eutropius, Biodorus, Strabo, and others. 
Doctor Evans remarks : 

It may indeed be urged that these writers are all of thein later than Cfpsar; but 
it is to be observed that the information upon which some of them wrote was derived 
from earlier sources, and that not one of tliem treats the presence of gold and silver 
in this country as of recent date, or apjiears to have had the remotest conception 
that in the time of Julius Ca-sar it was destitute of them.' 

Commerce- between the Gauls and Britons existed long anterior to 
the i^eriod of the Eoman invasion, and a native coinage existed also 
among the Gauls. The intercourse of the Phoenicians and Britons was 
also of an early date, and the founding of the Greek colony of Massilia 
(Marseilles) — usually placed at about B. C. 600 — also aided in civilizing 
that part of Gaul, where the neighboring Gauls no doubt first learned 
of the usages of civilized life, the effect of such acquirements gradually 
extending toward the channel settlements, and finally across and 
among the British tribes. From this center of civilization, says Doctor 
Evans, the Gauls became acquainted with the art of coining. 

The early silver coins of Massilia (and none in gold are known) were occasionally 
imitated in the surrounding country ; but when, about the year B. C. 365, the gold 
mines of Crenides (or Philippi) were acquired l)y Philip II of Macedon, and worked 
so as to produce about £250,000 worth of gold per annum, the general currency of 
gold coins, which had btsfore been of very limited extent, became much more exten- 
sive, and the stater of Philip — the regale numisme of Horace — became everywhere 
diffused, and seems at once to have been seized on by the barbarians who came in 
contact witb Greek civilization as an object of. imitation. In Gaul this was 
especially the case, and the whole of the gold coinage of that country may be said 
to consist of imitation, more or less rude and degenerate, of the Macedonian 
Philippus.2 

Doctor Evans further remarks : 

Another reason for the adoption of the Philippus as the model for imitation in the 
Gaulish coinage has been found in the probability that when lirennus plundered 
Greece, B. C. 279, he carried away a great treasure of these coins, which thus became 
the gold currency of Gaul. This would, however, have had more effect in Pannonia, 
from whence the army of Brennus came, than in the more western Gaul. 

On plate 46, fig. 1, is reproduced a type of the Philippus, the lau- 
reate head upon the obverse representing Apollo (or, according to 
some, of young Hercules), while on the reverse is shown a charioteer 
in a biga, with the name of Philip below a horizontal line in the 
exergue. 

The biga on these coins of Philippus II refers to the victories of 
Philip at Olympia. The resemblance to Apollo may have been sug- 
gested by some relation to that identification of Hercules and the sun 
which prevailed in Asia at a later time, and possibly as early as that of

British Imitations of Macedonian Stater. 



GRAPHIC ART OP THE ESKIMOS. 821 

Philip IIJ Between the horses and base line is the iigiire of a helmet, 
suggesting the head gear of the slain over which the victor is driving. 
On some specimens the helmet is replaced by the fulmen, a A, or the 
Greek /'. 

Because of the limited space, the wheel of the chariot is rather oval, 
suggesting perspective on the engraving, though on later imitations 
this can not be claimed for the elliptical form of the wheel or the 
character substituted therefor. "The earliest of the Gaulish imita- 
tions," says Doctor Evans,'* " follow the prototype pretty closely, but 
eventually both the head and the biga become completely transformed." 

The earliest British coins showing such imitation of the Philippns 
are believed to be of the i)eriod of 150-200 B. C., although the death 
of Philip II took place B. C. 336, so that his coins began to be 
imitated in Gaul about B. C. 300. 

The author whom I have above quoted says ailso that coins reduce in 
weight for the sake of the small gain of the governing power; and 
coincident with such reduction in weight, and jjerhaps size, there is a 
remarkable change in types, in each successive imitation, thus depart- 
ing more and more from the original prototype. "The reduction of a 
complicated and artistic design into a symmetrical figure of easy execu- 
tion was the object of each successive engraver of the dies for these 
coins, though probably they were themselves unaware of any undue 
saving of trouble on their part or of the results which ensued from it."^ 

By reference to the illustrations as figs. 4 and 5, and plate 47, figs. 3 
and S, examples selected from many diverse forms, there will be observed 
a most remarkable deviation in engraving from the original type. The 
wreath and hair become so strangely altered as to be scarcely recog- 
nizable, a few geometric or other simj)le figures serving in place of the 
leaves and locks. These finally result in a cross-like figure, as in plate 
47, figs. 1 and 2, while in some still other imitations the head is repre- 
sented by an ear of grain, like wheat or rye (designated by Doctor 
Evans as corn). 

The most interesting changes occur, however, upon the reverse of 
the imitations, and it is to these changes that I wish to make special 
reference. 

As stated, the typical Philippns bears beneath the horses a helmet, 
as shown upon the illustration in plate 46, fig. 1. This article of head 
gear may or may not have been known to the Gauls, and if it were, it 
is more than jjrobable that the Britons were unfamiliar with it, being 
more remote from the peoples by whom such defensive armor was 
used, so that even if the helmet was represented ujjon Gaulish imita- 
tions, the British engraver seems to have ignored the exact form and

to liave made what lie thought may have been intended, or perhaps 
even ventured to introduce a British sjanbolic figure, the signification 
of which he did comprehend. 

It is probable, also, that, in the absence of good tools for engraving 
metals, some of the simpler designs were made by using a pointed 
punch or like tool, and punching the i)atterns or parts of i)atterns 
desired. The pellet, surrounded by a ring of pellets, was equivalent 
to a ring with its nucleus, as in plate 46, fig. 8. The figure also pre- 
sents itself as a circle with four small pellets arranged in the form of a 
cross, and plate 46, figs. 2 and 6, and finally in the semblance of a wheel 
with six, seven, or eight spokes, illustrations of which are given in 
plate 46, figs. 7 and 8, and plate 47, figs. 1, 2, and 8. Leaving ofi" the 
circle suggested a cross, as in the former, and a star, as in plate 47, fig. 
3, both without doubt Druidical symbols, as was also the nucleated 
ring, of all of which numerous examples occur. This cross or star form 
ultimately gave rise to imitations of crab-like objects, which in turn 
were interpreted to denote figures resembling the hand. Such gradual 
though persistent imitation resulted in some remarkably dissimilar 
patterns, as may be noted by comparing the typical Philippus in plate 
46, fig. 1, with the illustration, plate 46, figs. 5 and 6, while beneath the 
figure of a disjointed horse on plate 47, fig. 3, the star survives; wliile 
the head upon the obverse retains but a few rectangular marks to denote 
leaves, while the right-hand upper figure signifies the eye, and the lower 
broken circle, bearing a <-shaped attachment, the mouth. 

The A, whi(!h has been referred to as a variant, and rarely occurring 
beneath the body of the horse, has been reproduced as a triangle, the 
angles of which consist of nucleated circles connected by short lines. 
This symbol is also an astronomical character, and is of frequent occur- 
rence on various petroglyphs located in that area of country formerly 
occupied by the several tribes of Indians composing the Shoshonian 
linguistic family. 

Again, the same object figures extensively in the mnemonic records 
of the Ojibwa Indians, especially those records relating to the sha- 
manistic ritual of the Mide'wiwin, or Grand Medicine Society, elsewhere 
described in detail.^ Another symbol found in lieu of the triangle, 
though without doubt a variant of it, resembles an Ojibwa symbol to 
denote " the mystic power of looking into the earth and there discov- 
ering sacred objects." It consists of three rings, or perhaps even 
nucleated rings, placed in the form of a triangle, a wavy line extending 
around the upper circle and downward to either side toward the lower 
ones, denoting '• lines of vision." What the signification of the char- 
acter upon the coins may have been it is impossible to imagine, unless 
it were merely a variant of the A , which in turn may have been a con- 
ventionalized form of the helmet, as shown in the typical Philippus on

EXPLANATION OF PLATE 47. 

Fig. 1. The Lead oruaiueut ou this piece becomes more cross-like than in the preced- 
ing, while upon the reverse the appearance of a nucleated circle beneath 
the horse is coiinteibalanced by another with an additional circle of dots 
or pellets about it above the animal's back. Upon the reverse is the name 
of a prince, Tasciovan, whose Latinized name would be Tasciovanus, the 
- exact form in which the name appears upon the coins of Cunobeline, who 
proclaims himself to have been Tasciovani F. 
Fig. 2. On this piece the cruciform ornament becomes still more intricate, while the 

circles are in various forms and of various types. 
Fig. 3. The remains of the wreath are undefined, and the object beneath the horse 
has assumed a stellar form instead of a circle, which in turn was a helmet 
iir the prototyiie. 
Figs. -1-7. These coins are cast and not stamped. In some specimens noted by Doctor 
Evans the grain of the wooden mold is distinctly visible. The obverse 
in all bears a head in imitation of some petroglyphic remains in North 
America, though the reverse shows the outline of an animal believed to 
be a, horse. 
Fig. 8. This specimen has a laureate bust without any signs of a face; the open 
crescents are connected by a serpent line. The reverse bears a horse with 
a triple tail and a wheel beneath the body.

plate 46, fig. 1. Very interesting indeed are the coins of tin — or an 
alloy in which that metal is in excess — though these are believed to be 
Gaulish rather than British, although the head of the Philippus proto- 
type is rudely reproduced, while the animal upon the reverse is believed 
by Doctor Evans to represent a bull rather than the horse. Plate 47, 
figs. 4, 5, 0, and 7. 

The human head upon the obverse is the rude representation of that 
part of the body, the face being indicated by two crescents, one above 
the other, with the concave side outward. The eye consists either of 
a simple ring, a nucleated ring, or the latter attached to a stem which 
extends down toward the neck. The animal form upon the reverse is 
readily determined by comparison with other coins showing variants. 

The two characters beneath the animal form on plate 47, fig. 4, appear 
to be a remnant of or to have been suggested by the exergual legend 
on the prototype on which the name, in Greek characters, of Philippus 
occurs. 

On some of the British coins no trace of a legend remains, but in a 
few instances some apparently meaningless characters ajipear to have 
been introduced, clearly indicating that the engraver was aware of 
some legend upon his copy, but being unacquainted with its import or 
signification, introduced an e(j[uivalent in so far as ornamentation was 
concerned, following the custom of geometric decoration. Such an illus- 
tration is here reproduced on plate 4G, figs. 3, 4, and 7. In other 
examples again, this style of zigzag decoration is omitted below the 
exergue line and a nucleated circle portrayed instead of a legend or 
other character, as in plate 47, fig. 1. 

The wheel of the chariot, which is apparent in the prototype, is gen- 
erally oval, sometimes elliptical, and in some of the British imitations 
a second wheel is placed upon any remaining otherwise vacant spot, 
such an illustration being reproduced on plate 47, fig. 3, while in jjlate 

46, tig. 8, two wheel- like characters are introduced, one above the body 
of the horse and the other beneath, instead of the common nucleated 
ring. In examining the numerous examples of coins one finds too that 
the British engraver has introduced, instead of the figure of a char- 
ioteer, a number of disjointed pellets or rings, and short straight or 
curved lines, making it almost impossible to trace the original in this 
jumble of characters. In some instances these segregated dots and 
lines again appear to become readjusted, ultimately forming a chari- 
oteer in the form of what seems to be a winged figure of victory. 

Similar unique and interesting imitations occur on the obverse of 
the British coins, in which the engraver's interpretation of the head 
of Apollo (or Hercules) is shown, sometimes as a fanciful cross, plate 

47, fig. 1, and in other instances as an ear of grain, examples being 
shown in plate 46, figs. 3, 5, and 7. 

In this use of the circles, nucleated rings, and other British or Gaul- 
ish symbols upon British coins, no evidence appears of the transmission 



824 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

of such characters from Macedonia, from which the coins were obtained, 
and which furnished the designs upon the Philippus for the British and 
Gaulish engravers. Nevertheless, other of the Macedonian coins bear 
upou the reverse concentric rings, between which are serrations, so as 
to almost appear like circular saws of various sizes laid one upon the 
other, diminishing in size toward the upper or last one. On a coin of 
Herod I., bearing a Macedonian shield, Avhile upon the obverse of the 
same piece is a helmet, with cheek pieces, surrounded by a legend. 
The helmet, which appears to form the chief emblem upon the piece, 
greatly resembles the smaller headpiece upon the obverse of the stater 
shown in plate 46, fig. 1 . 

Mr. Gardner,^ in his paper on "Ares as a sun god, and solar symbols 
on coins of Thrace and Macedon," shows that the Macedonian shield 
is of astronomical pattern, and belongs specially to a deity who is 
worshiped as the sun, and the interior device of this shield on the 
coins of Herod I. is identical with that adopted as the whole type on 
certain coins of Uranopolis of Macedon. 

The occurrence of circles to denote ring money is found in the l^jgyp- 
tian hieroglyphs, and it is barely possible that such characters upon 
obelisks, or in other petroglyi)hs, may have had some reference to ring 
money in the various countries with which the l^^gyptians were in com- 
mercial relations, extending possibh' to INIacedonia, Phcenicia, and other 
of the peoples of the northern sliores of tlie Mediterranean. 

The Egyptians used rings of gold and silver, and the Hebrew expres- 
sion for the heaviest unit in weight, the talent, originally meant a circle. 
Gold rings, says Mr. Madden,^ were also used as a means of exchange 
in Britain, in the interior of Africa, among the Norwegian sea kings, 
and in China disks with central perforations are employed. The brass 
cash is an illustration of the latter, and the sacred writings make 
frequent reference to rings of metal and strings of gold, the latter 
evidently being tied in bundles of certain specified weights and values. 

Interesting as this subject may be, it would be inapinopriate in the 
present paper to continue the study of types of rings and variants 
and their signification in the various localities throughout the world 
in which they occur as originals, and as the result of intrusion by 
intertribal traffic or otherwise. 

The wooden tablet represented in plate 33 is reproduced from 
Doctor Stolpe's monograph, published in "Ymer,"^ and illustrates one 
characteristic type of wood carving found in Polynesia, or, to be more 
exact as to location, in the Tubuai Islands. The circles are rather 
infrequent, but the triangular decoration is more common, and occurs 
upon various ceremonial implements and weapons in various forms and 
combinations. In some examples the designs are very complicated

and elaborate, while in other instances, as upon a metal surface, the 
result is a mere zigzag, the result of using a narrow graver, and as it 
is pushed forward the tool is rotated from side to side. 

The character of the material upon which decoration is attempted 
greatly influences the artistic result. 

Some circles from eastern Turkistau, to which my attention was 
called by my friend Doctor Walter Hough, of the National Museum, 
resemble almost exactly those mentioned by Doctor A. B. Meyer, 
who presented some interesting illustrations of shields from the Bis- 
marck Archipelago and New Guinea, upon some of wliich are several 
series of concentric rings (four) while some are nucleated with a solid 
spot and three surrounding rings.^ 

In his monograph on the whirring toy or " bull-rorer," Doctor J. D. 
E. Schmeltz^ presents a number of illustrations from various localities, 
nearly all of which are ornamented. Two si)ecimens from West Aus- 
tralia are of peculiar interest, from the fact of the recurrence of two 
figures shown on a lloman lamp from Carthage (plate 45, p. 81G). The

one specimen of these wooden toys is ornamented with five figures of 
concentric circles, the three middle ones having each five rings, while 
the flanking or end figures have each but four rings. 

The other toy has upon one side three figures of rectangles, each 
figure consisting of a nest of five, one within the other, as in the con- 
struction of concentric rings. At either end are short curved lines. 
Such a coincidence — as it can be nothing more — is truly remarkable, 
especially as the Australian designs are not in exact accordance with 
the usual type of designs. 

The district of Thisted, Denmark, contains many small grave mounds, 
from some of which unique finds have been obtained. One clay vessel 
covered with a flat stone contained about one hundred small boats, the 
ribs and sailing of which are made of bronze bands bent around one 
another, while in the middle of these lie sheets of thin plates of gold 
whose corners overlap each other at the bottom of the boat and are 
bent around the bronze bands above, covering it. In the same manner

the outside covering is effected.^ Upon the side of the boat illustrated 
in fig. 38 will be observed two figures of concentric rings, a design so 
frequently met with in the i^rehistoric relics of Scandinavia. 

A wooden dish,^ found with other objects in a funeral ship, bears dec- 
orations consisting of concentric rings similar to the preceding. 

Petroglyphs in abundance representing so-called cup stones, nucle- 
ated circles, and concentric circles of various numbers of rings, as high 
as five and six, and occasionally even more, occur throughout northern 
Europe, from Ireland, Scotland, and elsewhere in the British Isles, 
eastward throughout Scandinavia, Fiidand, and Russia, into Siberia. 

In a petroglyph at Lokeberg, in Bohuslan, Sweden,^ are represented 
a number of manned Viking ships, above three of which are portrayed 
nucleated rings, several of which are attached to projections connected 
with the vessel, and lesembling uplifted banners or other emblems. In 
a number of instances are small spots only, without the surrounding 
circle. These circles in contact with vessels resemble very much the 
Eskimo engraved figures on the rod shown in 
another place on plate 08, fig. 6. 

Professor Oscar Montelius figures in his "Kul- 
tur Schwedens in Yorchristlicher Zeit" a gold 
vase nearly 3 inches in height and about 4 
inches in diameter, about the body of which are 
four rows of concentric circles. The upper row, 
near the neck, consists of such raised figures 
each more than one-sixteenth of an inch in di- 
ameter, while the row a short distance below 
this consists of rings averaging three- sixteenths 
of an inch acTOSS. Below the greatest diameter 
of the vessel is another row of raised concentric 
rings, the outer one measuring about five-eighths of an inch across, 
while the circles near the base, and extending in a row about it, are 
apparently a little less in diameter. 

These rows of circles are separated by longitudinal raised lines, 
between some of which, both above and below the row of the largest cir- 
cles, are short vertical lines presenting what appears like a milled edge. 
This style of ornament is very general and, as noted elsewhere, of 
widespread occurrence. 

Mr. Frederick George Jackson, in his description of the jewelry of 
the Samoyads,* says that the bonnet is adorned with tails of colored

strips of clotli, to which are attached "brass disks (about 3 iuches in 
diameter) and other ornaments, such as brass charms, beads, and but- 
tons." It is probable that these materials are specially made in Russia 
for trade with the natives; nevertheless the nucleated circle is an 
important feature in ornamentation thereon, the metal j^endant, of 
which an illustration is given in fig. .'50, being not only very similar to 
the prehistoric ornaments of Scandinavia, but is decorated in the same 
manner. 

Mr. Jackson says furthermore: "While I am talking about Samoyad 
jewelry, I might mention the vast buckles sometimes used to fasten the 
belt. They are made of brass, stamped out with patterns, and are 
often 9 iuches in diameter. Of brass, too, and copper are their rings; 
and they even wear reindeer bells, each weighing at least half a jtound, 
hanging from their elbows." 

It is but natural to suppose that native art is thus stimulated, and 
influenced, by the i^robable introduction of materials of foreign manu- 
facture, such trinkets being gaudily decorated to add to their attract- 
iveness in the estimation of the uncultured natives. 

BECOKATION OF PERSONAL ORNAMENTS, UTENSILS, ETC. 

The utilization of various figures to apply simply for ornamentation 
is very common, and is of later date than the incision of simple lines 
and dots. The animate and other characters do not seem to have been 
used in any aesthetic manner until the system of pictography had gained 
a firm foothold. I^umerous examples are here given of simjile decora- 
tion of drill bows, for which no other record was ready, and of the 
various styles of decorating articles of primitive jewelry or i)ersoual 
ornaments, and other objects of daily use. 

The following list comprises a number of selections to illustrate the 
various methods of decorating articles of personal use or adornment, 
utensils of daily use, and other objects. 

A number of ear pendants are represented in plate 48, figs. 1-8 and 
10. The chief interest lies in the variety of ornamentation, consisting 
of drill holes, circles, concentric rings, and in one instance serrations 
are attached to the circles. 

The cup-shaped specimen shown in fig. 9 is a powder charge, orna- 
mented with conventionalized figures of flowers, fruit, etc., to which 
special attention is given in connection with conventionalization. 

Plate 32, fig. 1, represents ear pendants made of beluga teeth. They 
were obtained at St. Michaels, and are ornamented with the zigzag 
pattern frequently alluded to as the "fish trap" pattern. This pattern 
is quite neatly made and presents an unusually pleasing effect. Upon 
the bare space between the two transverse rows of (nuamentation is 
incised a small cross — a figure quite unusual in Eskimo art. 

Plate 32, fig. 2, represents a buckle or ornament used by girls in 
securing the hair. The decoration represents a face, the eyes being

iudicated by sharply incised lines, while the pupils are perforations 
made with a drill. The nostrils are also indicated with delicate per- 
forations, and the teeth are well defined. The lips are also well defined 
by means of transverse lines representing the gums and the edges of the 
teeth, while the other lines drawn vertically denote the spaces between 
the teeth. 

Plate 32, fig. 4, represents a comb from Cape Prince of Wales. This 
is of peculiar interest from the fact that it exactly represents in outline 
specimens from Torres Strait. The ornamentation resembles Papuan 
art designs, and also the peculiar meander or zigzag pattern referred 
to in plate 33. 

On the inner space are three ornaments which represent the conven- 
tional tree sjanbols. The specimen is an old one, as may be observed 
from its past usage and discoloration. The teeth are broken and appear 
to have been short. They were no doubt made by sawing with instru 
ments such as are shown in plate 17. 

Plate 49, fig. 4, represents a pair of earrings secured in a stick. TJpon 
the front are ornamental incisions representing concentric rings, from 
four sides of which extend short lines terminating in perforations. In 
one of these, however, the short connecting lines were not inserted — 
this part of the operation having evidently been neglected. 

TJpon the reverse are short i)rojections which are carved so as to 
curve downward, forming an T-shaped hook for insertion in the lobe of 
the ear. 

Plate 49, fig. 5, shows a similar stick with wrapping so as to secure 
a number of earrings which have been inserted, and in which manner 
they are transferred from i^lace to place for sale or for barter. 

Plate 50 represents a series of carved ivory belt buttons and pend- 
ants, as well as two spear guards for attachment to a canoe. On fig. 1 
is shown the crude meander or zigzag so frequently referred to. Upon 
the outer surface of these figures appear small tridents which represent 
trees, or rather they maybe termed the conventional ornamental figure 
evolved from the tree figure or tree design. A simple meander* or 
triangle is shown upon the button in plate 50, fig. "2, in which, it will 
be observed, the meander is produced by the interdigitation of short 
lines attached to the parallel lines within which the meander crosses. 

Figs. 3, 4, and have circles with various decorations, that upon fig. 
4 being perhaps the flower symbol, described elsewhere in detail. 

The ivory button shown in fig. 5 is decorated by simple perforations, 
each of which is filled with a wooden peg, the arrangement of the 
perforations being regular and symmetrical. 

Plate 51 illustrates six forms of bone belt fasteners or toggles. The 
specimen shown in fig. 1 was collected by Mr. L. M. Turner at Norton 
Sound, and measures 2^ inches across. Within the upper and lower 
margins are five horizontal incised lines, while along the vertical edge 
there are but four each. Upon the inner line and directed inward are

short iucisions, each one-sixteenth of au inch in length. Surronnding 
the central perforation is a quadrilateral figure conforming to the out- 
line of the ornament, consisting of three incised lines one-sixteenth of 
an inch apart. Upon the inner sides of the square are similar short 
lines directed upward toward the interior, as upon the inner line of the 
outer square. 

In plate 51, fig. 2, also from Norton Sound, the ornamentation con- 
sists of eight lines running parallel with the four outer borders, the 
interior space about the central perforation beiug blank. 

In plate 51, fig. 3, also from Norton Sound, the ornamentation becomes 
a little more complex. The two sets of i)arallel lines around the inte- 
rior form a square. Within each set of lines thus drawn are markings 
so placed as to form a crude zigzag resulting from the short lines pro- 
jecting alternately outward and inward by a process resembling what 
might be termed interdigitation. This has some resemblance to or sug- 
gests the Papuan patterns, to which reference is made elsewhere. The 
interior space about the central perforation is ornamented by two lines 
forming a cross. 

In plate 51, fig. 4, there is shown a buckle from Pinuit, Alaska, and 
both lines and dots are employed in ornamenting the surface. The 
squares are i^resent as in the preceding record, while small perforations 
occui)y the space between the groups of lines. 

In plate 51, fig. 5, from Norton Sound, the outer border consists of 
two decorated figures, while surrounding the central perforation are six 
concentric rings, four short lines diverging from the outer ring toward 
the outer angles of the ornament. From the inner angle of the inner 
quadrilateral figure are four short lines, each terminating in a V-shaped 
figure, or bifurcation, rudely resembling the conventionalized whale tail, 
though in this instance more likely denoting a tree, as it also represents 
a conventionalized tree figure. 

In plate 51, fig. (5, from Premorska two series of lines are drawn, with 
the difference, however, that instead of bearing additional ornamenta- 
tion between the two quadrilateral figures the ornamentation consists 
of nucleated circles, three upon each side, while within the inner 
square and surrounding the central perforation are three concentric 
rings. The space beyond the outer ring and the angle of the inner 
square is filled with small figures consisting of a spot surrounded by 
two concentric rings. 

Upon plate 52 are shown thirteen figures of needle cases or snuff' 
tubes, upon which are shown various styles of ornamentation. The 
specimen at the extreme left, from the Lower Yukon, is o(;tagon;il, 
while the next shows a series of rings produced by filing, as in the 
fourth figure, and to a certain extent in the last. The encircling hands 
upon figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 illustrate in various ways the rudimentary 
forms or originals from which have developed that i)ecnliar meander 
or zigzag to which reference is made in various places and in various 



830 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895 



connections, and which has been compared to a certain degree with 
the Papuan ornamentation referred to by Mr. Alfred C. Haddonj 
Upon the two figures at the right hand are a series of small, nucleated 
rings, and particularly in lig. 12 are shown several instances in which 
these rings are surrounded by radiating lines, a bottom line extending 
to a transverse base line or attached to another nucleated circle of like 
form. These may be related to the flower symbols, to which Mr. 
Lucien M. Turner makes reference in the letter which I have quoted. 

Plate 35, fig. 9, shows a tobacco box from Sledge Island. It is a rude 
imitation of a seal, a small opening l)eing cut in the neck, while the 
rear end was at one time undoubtedly closed by means of a wooden 
plug. The ornamentation throughout consists of parallel lines between 
which the incisions of short transverse lines are so arranged as to indi- 
cate the rude meander or zigzag pattern. Upon the back are several 
conventional tree patterns. 

Plate 25, fig. 1, represents an ivory casket from St. Michaels. It is 
made of the upper hollow portion of a walrus tusk and is very pro- 
fusely illustrated with the zigzag pattern, bordeis of which encircle 
the specimen both above and below, while around the center is an 
almost continuous pattern of six nucleated circles, each connected 
with the other by means of continuous strips or zigzag ornamentation. 
Between the two outer rims of each of these ornaments we find the 
fish trap pattern, in some the plain zigzag, in another short transverse 
lines, etc., showing various degrees of ornamentation of the same gen- 
eral type. Eadiating from the outer circles of all the specimens are 
short vertical lines at four opposite points, in imitation of the flower 
symbol. On the remaining spaces between this central ornamentation 
and the two outer margins are rows of small circles similarly orna- 
mented within by concentric rings and upon the outside by radiating 
lines. 

Tlie round box illustrated in plate 34, fig. 3, is from Norton Sound. 
This was used for holding fishing tackle. The top and bottom are 
made of wood, while the circular band is made of a flat piece of rein- 
deer horn securely lashed together at the joints by means of two iron 
and one copper clasp attached longitudinally. The surface of this 
band of horn is very neatly ornamented around the upper portion in 
zigzag pattern, while the corresponding border below has been left 
plain. Between these two borders, however, are a series of figures of 
concentric circles very neatly incised and arranged alternately, first a 
large circle, then two small ones. Each of these figures is furthermore 
ornamented by four radiating lines resembling the flower symbol, 
although from the great number of concentric circles within it there 
is suggested rather the idea of the symbol used to denote the nests 
of kantags or wooden buckets obtained by barter from the Chukchi of 
the Asiatic side. 

Plate 35, fig. 5, represents a bone -'mouthpiece" from Diomede 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 831 

Island. The ornamentation upon tliis is rude and deeply incised, con- 
sisting of a base line of two ])arallel incisions, between which is the 
rude meander or zigzag, to the top of whicli are incised at regular inter- 
vals trident tignres rei)resenting the conventional tree symbol. Simi- 
lar incisions and markings appear also upon ;i larger specimen from 
the same locality, shown in fig. 7. 

Plate 32, fig. 5, shows a specimen without any indication to mark the 
locality from which it was obtained, although fnmi its association with 
the collections from Alaska it may be inferred that it was made by some 
one of the native tribes, very likely the southern or southeastern 
natives, who have intermarried with the Thlingit, or possibl^^the Thlin- 
git themselves, although the carving very greatly resembles that copied 
after the work of the Haida. In almost any position in which the 
specimen may be held faces appear. Upon the lower side is tlie repre- 
sentation of a face the expression of which is exactly like that in fig. .">, 
while the front or rounded portion of the ornament shows a perfect 
snake's head, though this was probably intended to represent a seal. 
The ornament appears to have been used for attachment to tlie end of 
a cord, probably in harness or on some weapon. 

Plate 13 represents three figures of bone seine shuttles or handles 
from the Yukon Riv^er. The ornamentation upon tig. 1 is very simple. 
It consists of diagonal lines between two horizontal ones, with the 
exception of a small space about the upper third, where half a dozen 
lines cross at the opposite angle. Upon fig. 2 the lines are closer 
together, and in the lower figure very short lines are attached so 
as to extend at right angles from their respective base lines. These 
are of that primary type forming the base of the "fish weir" or "fish 
trap" pattern, which in turn forms the base of the rude angular mean- 
der and ultimately of the zigzag, to which reference is made elsewhere. 

In fig. 3 the ornamentation consists first of two horizontal parallel 
lines extending along each outer border. Between each pair of lines 
are short lines forming zigzags. The interior spaces are filled with 
other patterns. At the upper end is an animal, apparently represent- 
ing a wolf, with the life line upon the body, while at the lower extremity 
is the outline of a beaver. At the two small triangles formed by the 
cross lines at the middle of the specimen are two small trees, simply 
decorative, and intended to fill the blank space. 

Plate 49, fig. 3, represents a very beautiful net shuttle obtained in 
the Aleutian Islands by Mr. L. M. Turner. The only ornament of any 
(consequence on this represents a figure of concentric rings, from which 
radiate eight delicate lines. This is probably a highly (conventionalized 
figure of the fiower symbol, though in the pictography of the Ojibwa and 
some of the Shoshonian tribes it would denote the symbol of the sun. 

The superiority of the workmanship is apparent, and is character- 
istic of that of the southern Alaska, or rather the Aleutian, natives. 

Plate 23, fig. 1, represents a reel for sinew for small nets, obtained 



832 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

at Cape Vancouver, Alaska, by Mr. E. W. ]!^elson. The specimen is 
made of bone, and is decorated with incised lines extendiigfrom point 
to i)oint along- either edge, with interior markings of short lines, as 
shown on the specimen. 

Plate 23, fig. 4, represents a fishing implement made of reindeer horn. 
It is slightly curved and forked at either end, three of the four ends 
terminating in heads, probably that of the seal. The chief decoration 
consists of a median line extending from end to end, to which are 
attached several pairs of characters representing the herring bone 
pattern, though with the addition of short outer lines. 

The perforation visible in the center is intended for holding a drill. 

Plate 35, figs. 1, 2, and 3, represents small ivory thimble holders or 
guards. The ornamentation upon these is different, that upon fig. 1 
and fig. 2 consisting, respectively, of simple borings or depressions and 
concentric rings, while upon fig. 3 appears a continuous line, to which 
are attached several pairs of short oblique radiating lines, as in plate 
29, fig. 1. 

Plate 35, fig. 4, represents a seine thimble holder from Kushunuk. 
This is a rude outline of a seal with the young placed transversely to 
its back, while the ornamentation consists of several sizes of concentric 
rings, two of which show radiating lines attached to the outer surface. 

Plate 35, fig. 0, represents a thimble guard from Unalakleet. The 
ornamentation upon this is in imitation of that from the Northwest 
Coast northward from Kotzebue Sound, and consists almost exclusively 
of various patterns of the zigzag or meander design. 

Plate 23, fig. 3, is marked in the catalogue as a bone grass comb, from 
Kotzebue Sound. Mr. Murdoch, who has examined the specimen in 
my presence, believes it to be simply an ordinary comb for personal 
use. The ornamentation is divided into two panels, separated by four 
parallel transverse lines, each about one-eighth of an inch from the 
other. Short lines, placed closely side by side, radiate from the inner 
lines toward the outer. These inner lines with short radiating lines are 
reproduced at either end of the specimen. Reference to the illustra- 
tion will more clearly represent this. In the upper panel is the por- 
trayal of a whale, with some other lines probably intended to denote 
whales, but the figures were not completed. There is also a depression, 
which was used for the insertion of the top of a drill. The lower panel 
contains several pairs of parallel lines, between which is the rude out- 
line of a steamboat representing a revenue cutter. 

Plate 49, figs. 1 and 2, represents ivory implements, probably used in 
connection with harness. The former is decorated with a series of 
nucleated rings, all of one size and apparently made with the same 
instrument, while on the latter the rings are replaced by simple per- 
forations, some of which are about one-eighth of an inch in depth and 
were subsequently filled with a hard gummy substance. The most of 
them have now become emptied of this material.

The representation of the two snow sliovels, flg". 40 a and &, is to 
indicate the manner of attaching the ivory cutting edges upon which 
some of the engravings described are found. The wooden portion is 
generally made of spruce; the several pieces comprising the shovel, as 
above shown, are secured together by means of sinew braid. They are 
used for all kinds of shoveling in the snow, and sometimes for excavat- 
ing in snowdrifts, for making pitfalls for game, etc. The edge of the 
wood is fitted with a tongue into a groove in the top of the ivory edge, 
which is li inches deei). It is fastened on by wooden treenails at

been broken, by a stitch of black whalebone. * * * The whi})pings 
of sinew braid on the handle are to give a firm grip for the hands.' 

Fig. 41 is a fanciful object " made solely for the market." The speci- 
men measures 2.C inches in length, and is made of an ivory head fitted 
into a handle of wood painted red. "The head was called a 'dog,' but 
it looks more like a bear. Small bits of wood are inlaid for the eyes, 
and the outline of the mouth is deeply incised and colored with red 
ocher, having bits of white ivory inlaid to represent -the canine teeth.

From Point Barrow we have a twister for working the sinew backing 
on bows, iipon one side of which is a row of conspicuous nucleated 
rings.' The specimen is of ivory, and measures 5.4 inches long. It is 
one of a pair, as two pieces constitute a set. 

In fig. 43 is represented a good example of a native dipper made of 
fossil ivory. The decoration along the top of the straight flat handle 
and around the upper part of the outside of the bowl consists of 
nucleated circles. These were originally colored with red ocher, but 
are filled with dirt, while those upon the handle are, to a great extent, 
almost effaced by wear.

Another interesting specimen of workmanship, bearing ornamenta- 
tion of the same character as the preceding, is sliown in fig. 45, and 
consists of a chisel. Tlie small blade has an oblique tip, not beveled 
to an edge, and is hafted in walrus ivory, yellow from age. The 
nucleated rings are colored witli red ocher, and the two halves of the 
handle are fastened together by a stout wooden treenail and a stitch of 
whalebone.^

of these shafts are highly ornamented, the figures being all incised 
and colored, some with ocher and some with soot. 

The specimen shown on plate 53 represents a decorated hunting hat

like figure, black. The interior spaces between tlie black lines Just 
nauie'l are filled in with dark or dirty vermilion. 

Beads of dark blue, black, and white constitute portions of the 
decorations, while the projecting- lines denote the application of sea- 
lion bristles, over several of which beads have been slipped. 
The chief purpose of here representing the specimen is to show the 
place of attaching the decorated bone ornaments illus- 
trated on plate 52. The strips of bone are but one-eighth 
of an inch in thickness, yet there are a number of per- 
forations along the top curve and outer edge, in which 
were inserted bristles secured by small wooden pegs. 

The ornamental slab of bone attached to the right 
side of the hat is decorated witli oblique grooves, about 
one-half an inch apart, between which are 
rows of dots or complete perforations. 

Upon the left side of the hat the bone 
slab was split from near the top to the bot- 
tom, while the diagonal grooves were util- 
ized to carry threads beneath the level 
of the outer surface to hold together the 
pieces from completely separating. 

Upon the upi^er part of the back of the 
hat are two arrowheaded ornaments, each 
1^ inches in length and projecting at right 
angles from the wooden base, each being decorated with 
nucleated rings, those on' the central rows of four each 
measuring three-sixteenths inch in diameter, while the 
outer rows of three rings each are but one-eighth of an 
inch each. 

The two ends of the piece of which the hat is made are 
held together by means of a piece of wood T)^ inches long 
and less than an inch in width, placed horizontally at 
the back and bearing perforations along the central line, 
through which a sea lion's whisker has been passed in 
imitation of stitching, thus securing the ends with a ])er- 
fectness to almost resemble a continuous pi*^ce of wood. 

The decorations vary according to the owner's skill and 
taste, and are used in canoe trips to protect the eyes from 
the glare of light and to permit more intent gazing for 
the marine animals sought. 

In plate 54 are three examples of Eskimo bone carv- 
ing, the outer ones being charms and ornaments for attachment to the 
hunting hats, "an illustration of which, together with the method of 
attachment, is shown in plate 53. 

The specimen at the left of the plate, as viewed by the reader, was 
collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson at Shaktolik. It is of bone, and is deco-

ting the original bone to remain intact while the intervening portions 
were removed. The disks are each ornamented with five nucleated 
circles, the central spots being perforations of uniform diameter. 
Among these rings are three incised lines, darkened by dirt. 

The specimen at the right side of the plate is from St. Michaels, 
Norton Sound, and was collected by Mr. L. M. Turner. The s])ecimen 
is also of bone, and the decorations are alike on either side. This also 
is a charm for use on hunting hats. 

The specimen in the center of the ])late is of thin strip of bone, to 
be used for a similar purpose as the two preceding in ornamenting 
hunting hats. The specimen is marked "National Museum, No. 5604, 
Premorska, Yukon River," and was collected by Thomas Dennisou. 
The nucleated circles upon the specimen have running upward straight 
lines, bifurcated at tbe top in imitation of one variety of the tree sym- 
bol, while midway between the top and bottom are like projecting lines 
as at the top. At the lower extremity of the specimen is a simple form 
of decoration, consisting of a horizontal line from which short lines are 
projecting. 

Plate 7 represents three forms of ivory arrow and spear straighten- 
ers from three different localities and bearing different forms of decora- 
tion. The specimen at the left side of the plate was collected by Mr. 
E. W. Nelson at Diomede Islands, a locality occupying a position mid- 
way between the American and Asiatic continents. It measures 8J 
inches in extreme length, If inches across the widest part, and has an 
average thickness of five-eighths of an inch. The perforation with 
which the weapons to be straightened are held is at an angle of almost 
45 degrees, as compared with the plane of length of the i)iece. 

The rear or convex part is plain, but upon the slightly concave front 
is an engraving of a reindeer. The lines seem to be partly filled in 
with dirt, the result of use, and not with black coloring matter placed 
there with intention to intensify the sketch. 

The slight depression which appears lower down upon the handle is 
intended to be used in drilling, the top of the drill being held vertical 
by being inserted in the cavity, while the oi)posite end may be intended 
lor drilling holes, or for fire making. 

Another specimen is that at the right, also collected by Mr. Nelson, 
though at Cax^e Darby. This specimen, intended for similar service as 
the preceding, is shaped like the l)ody of a deer with the doe's head at 
one end, while the eyes are two blue beads neatly inserted in holes. 
Like the preceding, some traces of hunting records are retained, the 
incisions in several jdaces being almost obliterated by long continued 
use. At one place a native is represented as directing a gun toward a 
reindeer, while in front of the latter are several lines indicating that 
another specimen of the same species was to be engraved, but not 
completed. Almost beneath the hunter is a rectangular figure, to one

end of wliicli is attached a mammal, wliich, tliougli relatively small, 
appears to represent a bear. 

Upon the opposite side of the specimen, which is brownish yellow 
from age, are a number of delicate lines, some of which clearly por- 
tray habitations, a tree, two men, and a sledge with two dogs. 

Along the back of the specimen, representing the spine of the ani- 
mal indtated, are two parallel lines extending" backward toward the 
lozenge-shaped perforation used for straightening weapons. The per- 
foration, as in the preceding example, is also cut through at an angle, 
though only about 12 or 15 degrees variance from the line of the longest 
diameter. The entire length is 4f inches. 

The middle specimen is from ISTubriukhchuguluk, and was secured 
by Mr. Nelson. The form is greatly like that of a common steel car- 
riage wrench. It is made of bone, and the four sides of the handle

bear longitudinal lines with lateral cuts, so placed as to resemble 
arrowheaded or >-shaped figures. The type of decoration being one of 
the oldest and simplest, will be found more fully treated and illustrated 
in connection with the subject of decoration and conventionalizing. 

The specimen is apparently a very old one, archiBologically, and 
shows traces of long- continued or rough usage. 

Plate 40, fig. 6, shows an ornament for attachment to the cap used 
by Aleut hunters, as is shown in plate 53. This specimen was obtained 
at Kushunuk. The ornamentation consists of very strongly incised 
concentric rings, to the outer one of which are attached two parallel 
lines extending diagonally toward the base line, possibly with the 
intention of filling the blank triangular space, which would otherwise 
remain without markings. 

Many of the so-called drill bows in the collection of the National 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 839 

Museum are, in reality, handles for carrying- tool and other bags. The 
Point Barrow collection contains four such bags, and as Mr. ^Murdoch's 
description is short and to the point, I can not do better than to quote 
him. He says : 

These bags are always made of skin with the hair out, and the skins of wolver- 
ines' heads are the most desired for this purpose.' [Fig. 47.] 

The bottom of the bag is a piece of short-haired brown deerskin, with the hair 
out, pierced across the middle. The sides and ends are made of the skins of four 
wolverine heads, without the lower jaw, cut off at the nape and spread out and 
sewed together side by side with the hair outside and noses up. One head comes to 
each end of the bag and each side, and the spaces between the noses are filled out 
with gussets of deerskin and wolverine skin. A narrow strip of the latter is sewed 
round the mouth of the bag. The handle is of walrus ivory, Hi inches long and 
about one-half inch square. There is a vertical hole through it one-half inch from 
each end, and at one end also a transverse hole between this and the tip. One end 
of the thong Avhich fastens the handle to the bag is drawn through this hole and cut 
ofl' close to the surface. The other end is brought over the handle and down through 
the A^ertical hole and made fast with two half stitches into a hole through the 
septum of the nose of the head at one end of the bag. The other end of the handle is 
fastened to the opposite nose in the same way, but the thong is secured in the hole 
by a simple knot in the end above. On one side of the handle is an unfinished 
incised pattern. 

Many of these bag handles are decorated on two, three, or even all four 
sides, when thej^ are so fashioned, although some are convex above, as 
well as below, leaving but two sides upon wliich to engrave anything. 

Another variety of decorated handles are those used in small bags, 
meaning but one-quarter the size of the one above described. 

In addition to the incised ornamentation, both decorative and his- 
torical or mythologic, many of the small bag handles are carved with 
whale flukes, bear heads, seal heads, and other objects, as Avill be 
found upon examining various illustrations in the present i)aper. 

DECOKATION OF ANIMAL •CARVINGS. 

As in the preceding methods of decorating ornaments, various animal 
carvings, effigies, toys, etc., are also ornamented, the artistic eflbrts 
being directed, in many instances, to heighten the resemblance to the 
prototype selected. Thus are attempted the indication of spots, stripes, 
and scales upon animals and fish, the results being often very clever. 

Plate 53, fig. 1, shows a specimen which was obtained at Sledge 
Island. It is a very ornamental handle for packages or bags, to either 
end of which is attached a short chain. One of these chains terminates 
in a seal head. The links were cut from the same piece as the handle 
itself. The separate attachments to which the package is fastened 
consist of two small swivels, or x)ins, perforated below aud terminating 
on top in carved seal heads, the ears, eyes, nostrils, and mouth of which 
are clearly indicated. The ornamentation upon the top of the handle 
consists of four small characters of the primary form of decoration

840 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

previously referred to, and illustrated in plate 48, figs. 1 and 2, and plate 
31, fig. 2. 

Plate 55, tig. 2, is another kantag handle, and was obtained at Norton 
Sound. It is very old, measures 6^ inches in length, and is ornamented 
upon the upper surface with two rows of seal heads in relief, each row 
consisting of fifteen heads, upon which are indicated the eyes. At 
either end are the relief figures of two whales flanking the perforations 
through which the cords are passed. 

Plate 32, fig. 3, represents two ear pendants. Very quaint faces are 
inclosed by circles from which project four small circles or knobs with 
central indentations, Th(5 eyes, nose, and mouth very much resemble 
the face of a seal, the forehead being ornamented by small punctures. 
This closely resembles the carved ivory seal faces in fig. 0, in which the 
punctures are placed u])on the cheeks to indicate the root of the whis- 
kers. Above the eyes are markings to denote the eyebrows. In other 
respects the faces are very human. These faces resemble to some 
extent that shown in fig. 7, although it will be observed that in the 
latter the nostrils are very definitely outlined, while beneath the mouth 
are two pairs of descending lines to indicate tattoo marks. 

Plate 5G, fig. 2, represents an effigy of a seal. The concentric circles 
are ornamented on the outer side with three short radiating lines and a 
longer base line in exact imitation of the common flower symbol which 
it is undoubtedly intended to represent. The central perforations made 
by the central pin of the tool used in making the symbols are closed 
with wooden blocks which secure small bunches of bristles. Altogether 
the specimen is very artistically made. 

Plate 56, fig. 3, shows a belt clasp. This represents a seal. Ui)on 
the side of the body is a large figure of concentric rings, to either side 
of which are three small sets. The central one is furthermore orna- 
mented with four short radiating lines attached to the outer ring, while 
the small circles are decorated with short radiating lines, the upper one 
being represented hy pairs, while the bottom line is represented by two 
linesj yet the figures appear to be the same as the conventional flower 
symbol, which may have been utilized in tbis instance to ornament the 
body of the animal, as in the preceding case. 

Plate 20, fig. 3, represents a seal drag from St. Michaels. The thong 
is made of rawhide, and the instrument is used for dragging dead seals. 
It is made of walrus ivory, and represents two seal heads, the eyes and 
nostrils being clearly indicated, not only by i^erforations, but m one 
case the perforations are filled with wooden pegs, and the other the 
eyes are filled with beads. Upon the throat of each seal is the effigy of 
a whale, very neatly carved, and partly detached to add to its relief. 
The perforation extends through the mouth of the seal at the right 
hand, for the admission of a noose or cord. Upon the upper surface of 
the drag concentric rings are seen. 

Plate 56, fig. 4, represents the efiQgy of a seal, and was made to be

U5ed for attaching' cord and for dragging seals. The ornamentatiou 
consists of sharply marked nucleated circles. The specimen is from 
Kotzebue Sound, and is considerably ruder and less artistic than the 
other specimens in this series. 

In plate 5G, fig. 5, is reproduced the effigy of a walrus. The speci- 
men was obtained at Nashagak by Mr. E. L. McKay. As in tigs. 2 and 
3, the body is ornamented with concentric rings, to the outer of each 
of which are radiating lines, almost like the conventional flower symbol, 
and possibly intended for the same. Extending horizontally between 
these "circle markings" are rows of small perforations, or drilled holes, 
simply to serve as ornaments. The peculiar marking upon the top of 
the head, which no doubt is intended to represent the wrinkles or folds 
of the skin, is also the rude symbol of the female genitals as drawn by 
the Eskimo, and of which one single instance is found in the collec- 
tions of the ]S'ational Museum, and is reproduced in tig. 48. 

Plate 41, tig. 1, is an ivory wedge used for splitting wal- 
rus hide. The tool is made in imitation of an otter, the 
back and eyes having incised nucleated rings, with radii, 
which are connected by -lines. The back bears, within the 
parallel space, some herringbone patterns similar to those 
on the figures shown on the same plate (41), figs. 3 and 4. 

Plate 54, fig. 1, represents a carving of an otter. The arti- ^'^^^^^^^ °^

cle served as an ornament, but for what special purpose is 
not known. As will be noted by reference to the illustration, the back 
from the neck to the base of the tail bears a deep incision, through 
which were made several perforations for attaching it by means of 
cords to some other object. Within the concentric circles are blue 
glass beads which have been inserted in the perforations left by the 
tool used in making the rings. The eyes are also provided with small 
glass beads. All the lines and markings have been filled iu with some 
black coloring matter. 

Plate 57, fig. G, represents a beaver, upon whose back is the outline 
of a smaller beaver. Over the whole are ornamental lines crossing one 
another at right angles. 

Comparison may be made with an effigy of a seal, upon whose back, 
transversely and in relief, is a young one; both parent and young being 
decorated, the former with concentric rings. 

Plate 26, fig. 2, represents a bag handle from the Lower Yukon. 
The specimen is almost semicircular, and measures 9 inches across from 
point to point, and 4 inches in height. The upper or convex side has 
high relief carvings representing bears' heads, nine in number, the 
eyes and nostrils being pronounced perforations, while upon the fore- 
head of each is a sharply defined cross. Along the upper edge, corre- 
sponding to the necks of the bears, are the deeply cut figures of six 
bears, and continued around to the inside of the handle, and con- 
nected with the necks of three of the bears, are the figures of trees. 



842 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Immediately below the bears' heads are the figures of seventeen seals, 
to the back of each of which is a diagonal line to represent a harpoon, 
while transversely to the latter is shown the cord. These resemble a 
general attempt at ornamentation, the uniformity of drawing appear- 
ing to substantiate this belief. 

Plate 57 represents a number of figures of animals and fish, all of 
them toys, with the exception of fig. 4, w^hich is a drag handle. Fig. 1 
represents a flounder, and is ornamented with delicate incisions and 
radiating lines for fins. Fig. 2 shows an ivory carving representing 
seals and ornamented with delicate punctures and incised lines. Fig. 3 
is an effigy of a seal with the head portion j)lain while the back is 
ornamented with triangular marks as if made with single incisions of 
a three-cornered graver. Fig. 4, already referred to, represents a seal, 
the ornamentation consisting of curved parallel lines within which are 
short diagonal lines extending from each parallel line toward the other. 

Plate 57, fig. 5, represents the beluga, with very rude markings upon 
the back. 

The Kantag or bag handle shown in plate 58, fig. 3, is in imitation of a 
beluga whale, while the back of the neck also bears a rude outline of 
such a mammal. The shoulder bears a transverse bar within which is 
a meandering line extending from side to side of the animal; behind 
this are the figures of four "killer" whales, while near the rear end of 
the figure itself is the upper part of a bowhead whale shown with 
water spouting. 

Plate 55, fig. 3, represents a kantag handle from Sledge Island. The 
decoration consists of figures of four right whales carved transversely, 
two at either end. From the ends of the handle are suspended, in the 
shape of links, other whales, while upon the middle of the handle are 
engraved delicate outlines of two whales facing each other. 

Plate 41, fig. 6, represents a bodkin, the point consisting of part of 
a three-cornered file while the other end terminates in a short chain. 
The last link represents a fish tail and is ornamented with nucleated 
circles, while the handle of the instrument bears a series of nucleated 
rings with short radiating lines, representing the flower symbol, as in 
plate 15, fig. 4, though larger. 

Plate 57, fig. 7, represents a grayling, though in reality the shape 
and pronounced decoration of the npper half of the body represents 
more nearly the salmon. It will be noticed that the median line is 
ornamented with other lateral incisions in imitation of the "fish trap" 
pattern, while the fins are very pronounced and consist of sharply 
marked serrations, resembling one-half of the preceding pattern. 

Plate 57, fig. 8, represents a fish, the dorsal markings consisting of 
hatched lines. This probably represents a salmon.

PICTOGRAPHS OF DOMESTIC AVOCATIONS. 

The greater number of the records appear to come under this general 
caption, together with which some liunting scenes are included. The 
various forms of habitations used by the Eskimo are also here referred 
to, rather than in the previous chapters in connection with the geo- 
grax)hic location and environment of the several subtribes or settle- 
ments, because comiiarisons may here be made between^ the forms or 
outlines of houses, sledges, and possibly also canoes, to show the 
degree of fidelity of reproduction of specific i)eculiarities of either of 
the last named. 

HABITATIONS AND CONVEYANCE. 

In his reference to the dwellings of the Eskimo generallj^ Mr. 
Petroft'^ speaks of the winter and summer habitations as being (piite 
distinct from one another. The former being underground to a cer- 
tain extent, having a mound- shaped appear- 
ance with a ridge projecting for some distance, 
beneath which is the entrance, is closely imi- 
tated in the pictographs by the natives. The 
smoke holes are in the top of the dome, or near 
the center, for the escape of the smoke. The 
common houses, on the other hand, are inclosed Fig. 49. 

above ground, and partake of the nature of a nwELLma from cHurKCHE year 
log structure covered with skins, and some 

times of an ordinary tent-shaped shelter. The fire is built not within 
the tent, but before the entrance. This feature is also carefully observed 
in the etchings made by the native artist, and numerous examples are 
given in illustration thereof. 

A larger building, known as the kashqa, is found in almost every 
village, built after the pattern of the winter habitation. A raised 
platform runs all around the interior for seating the visitors, and on 
some of the larger kashqas several such tiers have been observed. 
These structures are generally used lor ceremonial observances. An 
illustration of the ground plan of such an inclosure, made by a native, 
is rex)roduced in fig. 49. 

In fig. 49 is the outline of a dwelling reproduced from plate 81, 
which constitutes a Chuckche "year record." The original was obtained 
by Baron ISTordenskiold in Siberia, and is now in the possession of a 
gentleman in England. The pictographs were drawn upon a piece of 
walrus hide. 

In the interior, at the left, is shown the ridge intended for seats or 
sleeping places. The occupant seated upon it appears to be gesticu- 
lating and in conversation with his comijanions. 

A similar drawing in fig. 50 shows this seat also. This sketch is

his companions are dancing. 

On the outside is shown one man at work chopping wood, while two

most a counterpart of

WINTER HABITATION, WITH WOOD CHOPPER AT WORK. t n r-^ 

In ng. 51 are repre- 
sented two forms, almost identical, of structures made for white men, 
to serve as trading establishments as well as sleeping quarters. The 
outline in some j)ictographs of traders possesses one more nearly like a 
one- story log house. 

On one of the ivory bodkins shown iii plate 24, fig. 5, the triangular 
figures with diagonal projecting lines on either side near the top are 
outlines of summer habitations, the utilization of which for apparently 
purely decorative purposes being probably prompted by the regular and 
angular forms, straight lines being preferable and more desirable for 
such ornamental engraving, as curved lines are foreign to the primitive 
straight-line system, largely attributable to the kind of instruments 
available and the generally difficult nature of the substance to be 
worked or engraved. 

In i)late 59, fig. 4, is another and ruder form of indicating the same 
style of summer habitation, the variants in plate 59, fig. 2, being also 
more explanatory in detail, and of interest as indicating a departure 
in engraving from the original t^pe of a tent shelter, the light lines 
diverging from near the top denoting the poles, over which some skins 
or imported fabrics have been thrown. 

In plate 00 are a number of illustrations of native jiursuits. In the 
fifth line, or No. 5, are shown some delicately engraved figures. 

Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 12 represent habitations of several kinds, of 
each of which the village is composed. The occupant at the entrance 
to No. 1 is employed in suspending from a pole — to the left of the house 
No. 3 — some meat, probably fish. Festoons of the same kind of food, 
for the purpose of drying, are sus- 
pended from the food racks shown in 
Nos. 4, (3, and S and on the horizontal 
pole resting on the roofs of the two 
houses at Nos. 9 and 10. A granary Fig.5i.

shown in No. 15 is greatly excited, having both hands, with extended 
fingers, thrown upward, the cause being seeu in an old man drag- 
gin'g- ashore a walrus, which is being harpooned by No. 17. The old 
age'^of the native (No. W) is indicated by his walking with a staff, this 
m'ethod of portraying an old person being common in many i)()rtions 
of the world, the Egyptian hieroglyphs abounding in characters 
abnost identical to the one here shown. The walrus (No. 19) is also 
shown as having been captured, the native in No- 21 having con- 
siderable dimculty in dragging it ashore, as he is down on one knee 
tugging at the harpoon line, while a companion is observed near him 
(No. 22), aiding him. 

Fig. 20 is the outline of a doe, which was also secured. No. 23 denotes 
a dog, while Nos. 21 and 25 indicate two other natives. 

An excellent illustration of the different methods of portraying canoes 
and houses is given in plate 60, seventh line, the whole scene denoting 
a native village situated near the water. Upon the canoe (No. 21) is a 
" shaman stick," or votive offering, erected to the memory of the one 
who owned the scaffold, and perhaps canoe as well. Another offering 
of similar purport is erected upon the roof of the house No. 10. One 
showing the same fan-like top will be found in connection with mortuary 

customs. 

At No. 1 the native is putting away something resembling a pole, 
while at No. G the two men seem to be engaged in conversation con- 
cerning the canoe, the one nearest to it having his right hand pointing 
toward or touching it. 

The winter habitations, with their entrances, are portrayed in a 
manner different from the usual custom. The entrance is very pro- 
jecting, and apparently overhanging. 

Smoke is seen issuing from the apex, chimney, or funnel containing 
a smoke hole, on the house No. 12. A food scaffold, known by the vertical 
poles projecting considerably above the transverse body, is shown in 
No. 13, while beyond Is what appears to be another scaffold. The 
erosion to which the ivory has been subjected has obliterated all other 
parts of the figure. 

A very common figure is that resembling an oblong box placed upon 
upright poles, in reality a scaffold, upon which is built a storehouse for 
the protection against noxious animals. These figures are usually 
placed near the representation of the dome-shaped winter habitation, 
as each family has such a storehouse. 

Other scaffold-like structures also occur, and frequently the kaiak or 
umiak, placed upon the scaffold for drying, may be mistaken for one of 
these, wdiich, in reality, are the resting place of some human body. 
This practice is not common everywhere, however.

REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



Ill some ethnographic " Memoranda concerning the arctic Eskimos in 
Alaska and Siberia," by Mr. John W. Kelly,i au interpreter, says: 

The Eskimo oomeaks (open boats) have a framework of spruce covered with split 
walrus hides, sea-lion skins, or white grampus skins. The latter is not used if sea- 
lion or walrus skins are obtainable, as it is rather thin. The Bering Strait and north- 
coast boats are generally 24 feet long with 5 feet beam, and have a carrying capacity 
of 15 persons and 500 pounds of freight. 

Those of the Kotzebne Sound average about 35 feet in length and 6 feet in width. 
They have a carrying capacity of 20 persons and 1,000 pounds of freight, or 3,000 
pounds of merchandise and a crew of 6 men. There are exceptional boats built on 
the sound that are as nmch as 42 feet over all. In crossing Kotzebne Sound or 
Bering Strait the natives sew on bulwarks of sea-lion skins a foot high to keep the 
water from dashing in. 

Mr. Ivan Petroif,^ who spent a number of years in various portions 
of Ahiska, in an official capacity, says of tlie vessels of the Eskimo: 

All the Eskimo tribes, without exception, manufacture and use the skin canoe 
known as the kaiak, identical with that of the eastern or Greenland Eskimo; and 
this feature is so distinctive and exclusive that a tribal name might justly be based 
upon it should the necessity arise for another. At present I kuow of ouly one 
instance where an intermixture of the Innuit witli another tribe has taken place

under such circumstances that the foreign elemeut has gained the upper hand, and 
there they have already abandoned the manufacture of the kaiak and apparently 
forgotten the art of its construction. I refer to the Oughalakhmute, who have 
mixed with the Thliuket. The open skin boat, the oomiak, or woman's boat, also 
known as hidar, is used by certain tribes on the north coast of Asia; but the kaiak 
proper is only found among the Eskimo. 

When the Russians lirst observed this craft, they ajiplied to it the name of bidarka, 
a diminutive of bidar, a Kamchatkan term for an open skin boat. This term is now 
used throughout Alaska wherever Russian influence once predominated, and the 
same word has been incorporated into several Eskimo dialects in the form of bidali, 
which is, however, applied only to two and three hatch kaiaks — a variety formerly 
known only on the Aleutian Islands, and adopted by the Russians for greater con- 
venience in hunting and traveliug. From Bristol Bay westward and northward the 
kaiak and oomiak only are' used. 

The accompanying illustration serves to show the general form of the 
kaiak, so often figured by the natives in their hunting record.-^ 

Although fig. 52 is from the most northern portion of Alaska, the 
generic type of construction is practically the same among all the

Eskimo. The double paddle is so often used in portraying signals on 
ivory that its representation here will be of interest in showing how 
accurately the native artist portrays even the tapering form of the 
blades.

KAIAKS. 



On plate 27 is shown an illustration of a native kaiak model. 

Several forms of the native ijortrayal of kaiaks are shown in figs. 53 
and 54. The first is a simple outline and incomplete, and an occupant 
was evidently intended to be i)ortrayed, as all the remaining portion of 
the record from which it was selected was complete in every detail. The 
two illustrations in fig. 54 are less accurate in outline, the latter being 
a simple group of scratches. 

The s]^ecimen shown in fig. 55 is very accurately drawn, the hari>oon 
and seal float being shown upon the kaiak immediately behind the 
hunters. 

The representation of large boats used for traveling, hunting, and 
fishing, for the propulsion of which boat oars and sails may be used, is of 
such frequent occurrence in the records of the Eskimo, 
that a reference to the vessel and its actual appearance 
is deemed apjiropriate. 

This large skin-covered open boat is in general use 
by the natives of Greenland and Alaska, as well as by 
the Aleuts and some Siberian tribes. The vessel is designated as the 
umiak, by tlie Point Barrow natives, and some of the Aigaluxamiut, of 
the southern coast, have used this name as well as the term baidarka. 

Eig. 5G represents a model of an umiak from Utkiavwiii, U. S. IST. M., 
No. 565G3,' and seems to illustrate the general form so closely followed 
in the engravings by native artists. The natives sit with the face 
toward the bow, using the paddle and not an oar. The women are

the stern, "rowing with long oars." Mr. Murdoch^ remarks with refer- 
ence to this that "though the women do a great share of the work of

navigating the boat when a single family or a small party is making a 
journey, it is by no means considered a woman's boat, as appears to be 
the case among the Greenlanders and the eastern Eskimo generally. 
On the contrary, women are not admitted into the regularly organized 
whaling crews, unless the umialik can not procure men enough, and in 
the 'scratch' crews assembled for walrus hunting or sealing there are 

usually at least as many men 
as women, and tbe men work as 
hard as the women." 

This is mentioned to explain 
the reason why the female fig- 
ure is absent in records of hunt- 
ing and fishing trips, although present in other scenes, such as domestic 
and probably ceremonial records. 

Plate 28 represents an illustration of a native model from Alaska. 
A native drawing of the umiak with four hunters is shown in fig. 57. 
The lines are heavily incised, and blackened. The men are without 
paddles, which may have been an oversight on the part of the artist. 
The spear or harpoon rest is also shown, as well 

as the weapon itself. i\\ 

A lesscarefully drawn illustration of an umiak ^^fc^^^uBBi 
is shown in fig. 58. The three occupants are m^- 

without paddles. Still ruder form is shown in 

fig. 59, where an attempt at throwing a harpoon at a whale is also shown. 
In fig. 60 is rei)roduced a still ruder drawing of an umiak, no hunter 
being shown, yet the record in which this vessel occurs is of a class, 
or in that condition of completeness, that should also have present the 
occupant. 

A better illustration of an umiak, containing five people, is shown in 
fig. 61. The lines are lightly incised. 

A neatly executed sketch of an umiak is illustrated in fig. 62. The 
bow is longer than usual, and also projects from the water. 

Two varieties 
of sledges are 
portrayed in pic- 
tographs made 
by the Eskimo, 
one of them being 
the railed sledge 

(fig. 63), used for carrying loads of articles belonging to camp eciuipage, 
etc., while the other pertains to a low flat sled«ie, without rails (fig. 64),' 
and used for carrying bulky objects, such as game, frozen seals, and, as 
Mr. Murdoch informs us, for transporting the umiak across the land or 
solid ice. Both are made without nails, the differentparts being mortised 
together and lashed securely with stitches of thong and whalebone.

The ruimers are made to slide easily by fitting to tliem shoes of clear 
ice as long as the runners themselves, " fully 1 foot high by C inches 
thick. The sledge, with these ice runners, is estimated to weigh, even 
when unloaded, upward of 200 or 300 pounds; but it appears that the 
smoothness of running more than counterbalances the extra weight.'" 

The flat sledge is used also for ordinary travel as well as freight, and 
an illustration of one with ivory runners 
is shown in fig. 65. 

The difteren(;e between these varieties 
are often very neatly portrayed, as well 
as other accessories pertaining thereto. Fig.eo. 

Doctor Ball furnishes several illustra- umiak. 

tions of sledges,^ one from Norton Sound being like the railed sledge of 
Point Barrow. Some difference, however, is apparent, and this may 
naturally influence the portrayal of the vehicle in engravings on ivory. 
The same author also furnishes the illustration of a Hudson Bay sledge 
in which the runners are absent, the entire base consisting of birch 
boards, three of which are laid side by side and secured, and about 12 
feet long. These are cut thin at one end and turned over like a tobog- 

gau, held down with rawhide, and inside

what different from the two forms already 
mentioned, the upper ratfl rising from the front toward the back, and 
resembling very much a native sketch of a dog sledge, as shown in fig. GO. 
The hunter seems to be seated upon the sledge, seeming to indicate that 
he has no other loads and that the rear projection on the sledge is the 
high framework shown in the Yukon type. 

In fig. 07 is a native reproduction of a dog sledge made somewhat 
after the type of the Point Barrow type, 
though no such drawings have been found 
in Point Barrow records. The men are both

denote the shaggy coat of hair. 

In his reference to the Eskimo of Melville Peninsula, Captain Parry 
says:^ 

The distance to which these people extend their inland immigrations and the 
extent of coast of which they possess a personal knowledge are really v^ery remark- 
able. Of these we could at the time of our first intercourse form no correct judgment, 
from our uncertainty as to the length of what they call a seenik (sleep), or one day's

arithmetic, the distauce from one place to another. But our subsequeut knowledge 
of the coast has cleared up much of this difficulty, aftbrding the means of applying

have not hitherto visited.

In the following description tents, habitations, and boats are illus-

Quite an interesting result is produced in plate 60, fig. 0, or sixth Hue, 
the drawing representing the outlines of the houses so that the inte- 
rior, with the occupants variously engaged, is exposed to view.

No. 2 is a rack, with food or goods on top, while at K"o. 3 is the first 
house of the village — the latter being indicated by the several habita- 
tions. One of the occupants is seated upon an elevated ledge or seat, 
while another is seated on the floor before it; the other inmates are

either seated or moviug about as indicated. Upon the roof is a votive 
offering, a bird-shaped "shaman stick," the import of which is else- 
where described in detail. Still more of the family are seen at the 
entrance to the house, one person within, while two are upon the roof. 
In the storehouse, or rather beneath the goods, No. 5, is visible a dog 
fight, the animals being drawn in the attitude of si)ringing at one 
another; at the right is the owner occupied 
in removing some article from the scaffold. 

In the habitation No. C, with its entrance — 
No. 7, are a number of persons in various atti- '^'

tudes. One is reclining upon the elevated 

shelf used for both seat and bed; while uj)ou the tioor are three seated 
at a table, those behind it being represented or partly hidden, the upper 
parts of their bodies only rising above the board. A number of other 
individuals are shown occujiied in other ways. The scaffold at No. 8 
supporting the goods, as usually represented, has also a horizontal pole 
for drying meat, several x>ieces thereof being designated, while two 
liersons beneath seem to be touching hands or handing some article. 

The habitation No. 9, and its entrance No. 10, also indicates a num- 
ber of the inmates. One in particular is making gestures to another; 
between the two there is an object resembling a person as if wrajiped 
in a blanket. Smoke is seen issuing from the smoke hole, while above 
it is what may be here intended the evil spirit of a dead person return- 
ing to take possession of a sick one. 

The Eskimo generally believe in the return of the soul of the dead, 
and especially does the disembodied spirit hover around the house of 
the dead for three days, in the endeavor to return and to possess itself 
of a living body. In the purpose of guarding against this evil, the 
inmates make certain shamanistic preparations, prompted by the local 
shaman. The smoke issuing from the mouth of the smoke hole leaves 
open the way for the return of the evil spirit and his companion spirit, 
seen approaching from above the house. 

No. 11 represents a scaffold for the storage of food, and a man is 
seen in the act of reaching toward the black spot denoting reindeer or 

venison house, as the shape indicates.

occupied near the lire beneath it. A ladder is placed against the out- 
side of the entrance to the house, and a man is seen part way up near 
another person who seems to be occupied in gesture and conversation.

Auother uian is seen carrying a snowshoe-like object, probably of rein- 
deer or deer, to the summit of the house roof to dry. Tlie pole, with 
crosspiece, situated near the head of the ladder, is a votive offering 
erected there by one of the inmates. 

No. 13 is a sledge, upon which is seated the driver using his whip. 
The dog is urged forward, and another native, one of the three, No. 14, 
who had been oft' trading for skins, is hailing a boat seen coming to 
the shore with the gunwale parallel therewith, pre- 
senting another good instance of foreshortening of 
■k the object. The man behind the sledge is walking

apparent connection with the completed record, occurs also at a point 
over the three wading boatmen following the baidarka, No. 10, which 
is being pushed ashore. No. 17 is also in shallow water and appears to 
start away as the oarsmen are seated within with their arms extended 
grasping the paddle. 

An interesting and cleverly drawn native sketch of a man mending 
a seine net is shown in fig. 08. The attitude is lifelike, while in one 
hand is portrayed a short line denoting the shuttle. 

A man splitting wood is shown in the accompanying illustration, 
fig. 09. He has a heavy mallet or some other like utensil raised above 
his head, and in the act of driving wedges to split a piece of wood. 

Plate 59, tig. 1, represents an old stained specimen of ivory from 
Norton Sound. The engravings upon this are rather deep, and are 
tilled with deep brown coloring matter. The semicircular objects to 
the right of the middle, some being shown in rather an angular form 
toward the left of the middle, represent habitations. These characters 
appear in a more conventionalized forn) and for decorative purposes in 
plate 24, tig. 5. 

The chief interest attached to this record is in the variety of forms 
of habitations, thus enabling one to perceive the differences in the 
variants placed in consecutive order. The two 
extremes are very unlike, and would scarcely be 
recognized as portraying a similar idea, but for the 
intervening examples showing the evolution in the - 
execution of form. ^ig- 69. 

The two elongated tigures to the right of the habi- ^^i^itting wood. 
tations denote invited kaiaks upon racks for drying. The human fig- 
ures, one of whom is shown seated, represent natives supplicating a 
shaman for aid. The tigure has both arms extended, as in making the 
gesture for supplication, while the shaman, standing at the left, has his 
arms and hands uplifted, as in the gesture illustrated in several figures, 
relating to shamauistic ceremonials, termed by the natives as " agitating

the air" in order to call to liim his tutelary guardian, who is to aid the 
shaman in success, in order to conii^ly with the request made of him. 

Within the dome-sha])ed habitation nearest the shaman is an accom- 
paniment of tambourine drumming, while two assistants are also 
engaged in invocation. 

To the right of the su])plicant is a repetition of his own form, indi- 
cating his harpooning a. seal or other animal, while still further tt)ward 
the end of the rod is an unfinished figure of a man in a kaiak — ])robably 
the supplicant in another exploit made possible through the shaman's 
assistance. 

Turning the bow around so as to bring the (convexity beneath, there 
appears at the left a linear outline of some undetermined animal, near 
to which is an umiak containing three men. They are approaching a 
settlement indicated by two forms of habitations, a dome-shaped or 
permanent one and a triangular or temporary shelter, tlie two denot- 
ing both kinds constituting the village. 

Two racks are visible, a single one from which are suspended numer- 
ous stands of meat or fish, and a double one, similarly filled with food. 
The rude outline of a native at the right is nearest to a boat lying upon 
its side, beyond which are the outlines of fimr waterfowl. 

Some whales are next portrayed. The one with the flukes above the 
water, and the spray thrown or forced from tlie spout holes, appears to 
have thrown from the water the vessel containing four natives. Their 
vessel is curved, making a slight arch, and the exj)osed end seems 
broken open. 

The whale beyond this is harpooned by a native in a kaiak 5 the 
inflated float is still ui)ou the kaiak behind him, indicating that not 
much line has run out, as the whale, also, is headed toward the hunter. 

The whale to the right of the preceding character has tlie tail up in 
the air, while some water is indicated as issuing from the spout hole. 
In front of this is an umiak with four liunters making for a herd of wal- 
ruses on and about a ledge of rocks. 

The rocks are indicated by the short markings between the two par- 
allel lines denoting them, the markings consisting of the pattern 
frequently mentioned herein as fish trap, and of Avhich nunu^rous illus- 
trations are given, as on plate 31, fig. 2, and i)late 3(5, fig. 2, and on the 
accompanying plate 50, fig. 3. This indication of rock is of interest in 
its differentiation from ice, as a solid mass, the latte)' being drawn only to 
show its outline as a floe, the interior part of the space being left blank 
to denote its colorless or transparent condition. On the same plate, 
plate 59, in fig. 2, is shown a floe upon which seals are taking refnge. 

The speaker, or rather he of whom the record treats, in plate GO, fig. 
8, is represented at ISTo. 1. His right hand is elevated as when used in 
gesticulating, while his left points down toward the foot of the scaffold 
upon which is a repository for food. The two scaffolds at No. 2 no 



854 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

doubt belong to him, and form part of the village indicated by the 
several habitations and storehouses. 

No. 3 is a dome-shaped winter habitation, about which two people are 
occupied. No. 4 is another granary or food repository, while No. 5 
represents a second house upon which two people are talking very 
animatedly. The one at the right seems to be requesting, or suppli- 
cating, both hands being directed upward toward the one spoken to. 

No. G is the storage place for food and other articles, while in No. 7 
we find another dome- shaped winter house with the inmates in view. 
A third i^erson is standing before the door, while under the accompany- 
ing scaffold a fourth individual is visible. 

No. represents a winter house, and smoke is rising from the place 
where the smoke hole is usually found. The smoke looks straight and 
rigid, resembling a tree. The two people seem to be occupied in carry- 
ing something. The illustration at No. 10 is a scaffold for the safe loca- 
tion of food, and Nos. 11, 13, and 14 are similar structures, whereas No. 
12 is a warehouse, probably of a white trader. No. 15 is a winter house, 
though apparently deserted. 

The specimen represented in plate Gl is a pipe bearing delicate and 
elaborate etchings of a variet}^ of subjects. The object is made of wal- 
rus ivory, measuring 13^ inches in length, If inches in height near the 
insertion of the bowl, and slightly less than 1 inch in transverse diame- 
ter at the same point. The perforation at the mouthpiece is one-eighth 
of an inch m diameter. 

The bowl is of block tin, while the top of the bowl is lined with a thin 
sheet of perforated, ornamented brass. The caliber of the bowl is only 
one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and seems to have been made in 
imitation of a Chinese pipe bowl and possibly for the same style of 
smoking. 

The pipes, like others of like form from the same locality, at St. 
Michaers[?], have been said to have been made for sale to traders. 
That may be, and does not in the least impair the interest and value 
of the pictographic records portrayed upon the several sides. Though 
the pipes may be shaped, to a limited extent, in imitation of foreign 
shapes, yet the pictography remains Eskimo, made by an Eskimo, and 
to portray P^skimo scenes and avocations. 

The upper figure of the pipe presents the characters on the left side, 
and beginning at the extreme left is observed a vertical ornamental 
bar or border, similar to those drawn along the lower half of the pipe 
stem, though in the latter space they are arranged diagonally, and 
made to separate ornaments consisting of concentric rings, ornaments 
to which special reference is made elsewhere. 

The first group consists of two persons engaged in twisting a cord, 
though the suggestion has been made that they appear to be engaged 
in a pastime which consists in making string figures, similar to the 
American boy's "cat's cradle," etc. The figure next to the right repre- 
sents the end view of a building having two rooms, in the larger of

which appear two persons seated playing on tlie tambourine drum, 
while a third i^erson is depicted in the graceful attitude of dancing 
"a la Americaine," The fourth figure is crouching or kneeling before 
the hearth, probably to light a fire, as none appears to be there, as 
indicated by the absence of smoke. The presence of fire is generally 
indicated by the portrayal of short lines adhering to a vertical one, to 
denote smoke. 

Upon the outside of the large room is alow structure containing the 
second room. The face of the sun is painted ujion the wall, in reference 
to the return of the sun and warm weather — to spring; and the droj^s 
of water, caused by the melting sun or ice upon the roof, are shown 
dropping from a short wooden carved spout. The carving seems to 
have been made in imitation of similar opes found among the T'hlinkit 
and Haida Indians. The above dance and portrayal of the sun refers 
to highly important and complicated ceremonials observed at the return 
of the sun from the south. 

The illustration reaching almost across the ivory sj)ace, that resem- 
bling light lines in imitation of a ladder, is a fish weir, ])laced in 
streams for catching salmon, and one of these fish is actually shown 
approaching the opening leading to the inclosure in which the game is 
secured. An otter is also drawn approaching the fish trap, denoting 
the destructive habits of the mammal in robbing the trap of fish thus 
secured and unable to escape. 

The rectangular figure immediately behind the otter appears to be a 
view of the top of a boat landing, facing the water, and upon which 
are two persons, one seated near a handled vessel — probably a bucket 
or basket — while the other is drawn in the attitude of spearing fish, 
the entire sketch seeming to have reference to another method of secur- 
ing fish for food. 

Immediately across the ivory space, and along the opjiosite base line, 
are observable four persons, each drumming uj)on his medicine drum 
and approaching a dome-shaped habitation, within which are portrayed 
two persons, crawling forward on hands and knees to receive from a 
seated figure some mysterious or magic substance. This is a shaman- 
istic ceremony, in which some charmed medicines are secured, and by 
means of which some special success is expected in the chase. 

The character in the middle of the ivory rod, nearest to the dome- 
shaped house, is a si)Out of water, at the narrow end of which is a trans- 
verse line, with a shorter one within the inclosure. These two lines 
denote the logs of wood employed by the beaver in building a dam. 
The beaver is shown swimming toward a dark spot, which seems to 
consist of a series of short scratches, and which denotes the deposit of 
twigs for food, while the rounded dark disk upon the shore line repre- 
sents the beaver's house. The animal is accurately portrayed, the tail 
being especially conspicuous to give specific indication as to the species 
of animal intended to be shown. 

lu the next figure is represented one method of securing deer. The 



856 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

iiiclosure, within wliicli three deer are shown, is a pen made for securing 
such game, the fourth animal to enter having been driven forward from 
the open country and guided toward the entrance by the erection of 
low brush fences, as will be observed, extending diagonally toward it 
from the base lines at either margin of the ivory. The two hunters, 
armed with bow and arrow, are seen running toward the inclosure to 
shoot the deer. 

Beyond the rear fence or inclosure of the deep pen are two pine trees. 
Upon one is perched a bird, while half-way up the other is a small mam- 
mal. The latter is not drawn in imitation of the porcupine — as else- 
where portrayed — and it may be intended to represent the marten. 
The next figure is a black bear, erect upon his hind feet and being 
attacked by a hunter armed with a spear. 

The next scene is a snare trap, which has caught and suspended in 
the air a small anhnal. The trap is surrounded by vertical sticks so 
arranged about the baited part that, to cause it to be sprung, the ani- 
mal can reach the bait only at one open space. The noose is arranged 
so as to catch the animal about the neck, in imitation of the American 
boy's rabbit snare. 

The next trap shown consists of a log, or sapling, resting upon a 
short upright piece, so that when the bait is touched the log will fall 
and secure, by crushing, the animal so unfortunate as to enter. The 
top is weighted by extra pieces of timber and sometimes stones, secured 
so as not to fall oft'. A small animal is seen approaching the trap from 
one side, while from the other is seen approaching a bear; the idea 
being that this arrangement or ki-nd of trap is employed in securing- 
both kinds of animals. The small deer and men shown along the oppo- 
site base line represent two hunters disguised in wolf skins so as to 
more readily approach within shooting distance of the reindeer, while 
the third has gone forward and shot an arrow, which is seen in its flight 
ai)proachiiig an animal. 

The last figure of the group is a fallen reindeer upon which one bird 
of prey has alighted and another is seen descending. The feathers in 
the outstretched wings are clearly indicated and the attitude is very 
lifelike. 

The upper ridge of the right side of the pipestem also bears some 
interesting scenes. That on the section nearest the bowl contains two 
human figures, one representing a native in the attitude of kicking a 
ball, his leg being still in the air, while the other person is portrayed 
as reaching out his hands as if to catch the ball as it descends. The 
illustration next toward the left rejiresents a habitation with two rooms, 
in the larger of which is a horizontal line, midway between the floor 
and ceiling, denoting the shelf used as seats and for sleeping. Upon 
this shelf are seven persons, five of whom are represented as drum- 
ming, using the ordinary tambourine for the purpose. 

Beneath are five characters, four being shamans, while the fifth, a 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 857 

smaller one, sliown as liorizontal in the air, is the demou which has been 
expelled from a sick man. The smaller apartment shows one person 
with a dish, or pan, probably preparing food for the participants in the 
ceremonials conducted within the adjoiniug room. 

Outside of the house is a man portrayed in the act of splitting wood, 
the log beneath his feet having two wedges projecting which arc being 
driven in to split the timber. A second individual is pushing at his 
dog sledge, he having returned with a load, as may be observed, the 
logs still in position *at the front of the .sledge. 

Tbe figure next to the preceding is seated upon the ground and 
apparently mending his net. The characters above the wood chopper 
and the returning traveler are drawn upon the opposing base line. 
The figure in the attitude of running is going to the assistance of one 
who has caught a seal, the latter resisting capture by the use of his 
flippers, which are drawn extended from the body to denote their use 
in the present instance. The ring indicates a hole in the ice, while the 
bar held in the hands is the piece of wood to which the line is secured. 

The illustration of fishing through the ice is shown in several records, 
but in none more graphically than in the figure nearest to the seal 
hunter above referred to. The native is here shown seated, and before 
him is a fish lying attached to a short line by which it is secured, while 
with the other hand the fisherman is holding his rod, the line passing 
through a hole, and beneath are shown the sinker and hook, while a 
fish is seen approaching to take hold. The rei)resentation of the trans- 
parency of the ice was no doubt beyond the ability of the artist, and he 
therefore very wisely made no attempt at any indication of a surface 
line. 

By turning over the pipestem the record may be renewed at the fig- 
ure of the umiak, containing five hunters, four of whom are using the 
paddles, whilst the fifth is throwing a harpoon toward a large walrus. 
This creature has already been harpooned by a hunter in a kaiak, who 
is holding up one hand with his fingers spread, while in the other hand 
he holds his paddle. Upon the stern of the kaiak is the float, used in 
connection with the harpoon line. A second walrus is observed imme- 
diately behind the harpooned animal. 

At the extreme left of the stem is a crouching or kneeling hunter 
preparing to throw a harpoon at a seal or female walrus, from whose 
mouth drops of water or ])erhaps blood are seen to trickle. 

Upon the ojiposing base line of the pipestem is a single whale hunter 
in his boat, a small whale having been harpooned, while to the line a 
large skin float is attached to impede the animal's motion. The other 
whale is escaping, and the water is shown spouting from the nostrils 
of both animals. 

The ornamentation upon the two lower sides, as well as the tree-like 
figures near the mouthpiece, will be discussed in connection with the 
evolution of ornamentation. 



858 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The specimeu represented iu tlie upper figure in plate 62 measures 
12 inches in length along the central line and If inches iu height at 
the back of the bowl. The latter measures 2^ inches across the top 
and is 1^ inches in height. The pipestem is made of a fine compact 
piece of walrus ivory, which retains some of its lateral curvature as 
well as that visible from the front view. The bowl is symmetrical and 
was undoubtedly turned on a lathe. 

The characters portrayed along the middle base line, beginning 
nearest the mouthpiece, represent, first, a seal, theii two water fowl. A 
walrus then appears above the surface and is looking after the umiak, 
which has passed in pursuit of a whale, and which creature has been 
attacked by one of the hunters. The second hunter is holding aloft 
his oar, a signal to indicate to others near by that assistance is wanted. 
The other men in the umiak are using the paddle so as to keep pace 
with the whale, which is shown spouting. 

The elevated scaftbld which is next portrayed was a notched piece 
of timber set in place to serve as a ladder, and one person is shown 
ascending, a bundle being attached to his back — probably food — as the 
other person on the scaffold is occupied in preparing food of some kind, 
which is then suspended from the horizontal poles, as shown in the 
etching. The next illustration, to the right, represents a fisherman 
hauling up his net to dry, while another man is occupied in splitting 
wood, the wedges used for the purpose being shown in the log at the 
end resting upon another piece of wood or a stone. 

The house, which comes next in order, has two rooms, upon the roof 
of the smaller one being shown an individual carrying into the house 
some pieces of wood, which have been split by the wood chopjter. The 
horizontal line at the top of the large room has suspended from it small 
round objects which denote some kind of food; and at the middle line, 
the shelf, used as a bed or for seat, shows three persons; the first one, 
with one leg hanging down, is pointing, or reaching, toward a dish 
containing food, as the second has already placed some into his mouth. 
The third person is lying down, with legs curved and his head resting 
upon a pillow or bale of some material found convenient for the i)ur- 
pose. The person seated upon the floor does not seem specially occu- 
pied, and directly behind is a vertical line, upon which is a lamp, the 
usual method of constructing these being that of placing two soapstoue 
lamps upon a crosspiece, so as to balance, the center of the latter being- 
secured to a vertical stick. 

The last illustration denotes a dome-shaped structure with a smoke 
hole in the roof, one person being apparently busied with his pipe, 
while the other has before him a kettle, in which he is stirring with a 
stick or ladle. Between the two persons is the fire, from which the 
smoke is seen to rise and to escape through the opening at the top. 

Within the small room of the house above mentioned is a short 
vertical line, to which are attached some small globular figures. The

line represents tlie spout and is on the outside of the house, while the 
globules denote drops of water — similar to those portrayed on the pipe 
with the metal bowl, plate 61 — and refers to the melting of the snow 
upon the roof, as the approach of spring is referred to especially. On 
the opposite side of the specimen, the first character is a man, with a 
bundle on his back, running in the direction of an inclosure and deer 
drive. Two reindeer are already in the pen, while three animals are 
running toward it, closely pursued by the drivers, one of which is 
armed with bow and undoubtedly also arrows. 

The third person, walking along the upper base line, is in attendance 
at a fish trap, into which four fish are seen to swim. Beyond this is a tall 
pine, upon the summit being a bird, and half-way up, a small mammal. 

The scafibld beyond this has upon the roof a man engaged in hang- 
ing up deer, which have been captured and brought home by the two 
men at the dog sledge, upon which is another deer. Immediately above 
these figures is a man leading a dog hitched to a sled and thus dragging 
home two seals — the latter represented upon their backs, just as these 
animals are gotten along easily on account of the abundance of hair. A 
large bear is shown upon his haunches, one native attacking him with a 
spear, while the second person has started to run away after shooting 
an arrow into the bear's back. The remaining two figures denote two 
kinds of trails used in catching small animals, one being caught by a 
noose, while the second is a deadfall. 

Upon the upper base line, beginning nearest to the tall pine tree 
already described, one man is shown attempting to take a somersault, 
possibly as a pictorial portrayal of the sense of joy at the return of 
summer; the second person has a rod which he is dragging home. 
The two dogs are very cleverly portrayed, while the man next to the 
left is spearing an otter. The animal upon the ground seems to be 
intended for a marten. 

A clever sketch is presented in the next illustration, in which a native, 
with a pack on his back and a small bucket in his hand, is gathering 
berries. 

The recoifd ends with a deer, which has been secured by means of 
suspending a strong noose over a path or trail frequented by the 
animal. The hunter has come up to kill the caiDtive with a spear. 

The decorative designs are treated of elsewhere. 

The specimen shown in plate 03 measures 10§ inches in length, 1^ 
inches in height at the highest part near the bowl space, and seven- 
eighths of an inch in diameter. 

This differs from the other jjipes in the manner of placing the engrav- 
ings, these occupying the lower spaces, while the upi^er bear the con- 
centric rings and diagonal lines. The left-hand figure in the upper 
illustration in the plate denotes a habitation with its entrance. Seated 
upon the projecting shelf seat is the drummer, holding the tambourine 
drum in one hand while with the other he gras])S a drumstick. The 



860 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

other figures are the dancers, in various attitudes, with hands and 
fingers extended. Upon the roof of the entrance are two men in simi- 
lar attitudes, wliile within the entrance is one figure of a man in the 
attitude of falling forward upon the ground. The dance does not appear 
to be, a shamanistic ceremony, as otlierwise the indication of a demon 
would be observed. 

In front of the entrance is a group of figures in a threatening atti- 
tude, especially one of the men, who appears to be drawing his bow with 
the intention of shooting his vis-a-vis, who has a hand up ns if guard- 
ing his face. There appears to have been a discussion respecting a 
seal — lying upon the ground between the men — which resulted as 
suggested. 

The next figure is shown in the attitude of spearing a seal in the 
water, the spear bladder being shown at the upper end of the weapon. 
The next man is dragging home a seal, while the next following is 
engaged with a like animal, stooping down at the tail and for some 
purpose not indicated. 

The large creature lying upon the base line, next to the right, is a 
whale. One of the hunters has a hatchet and is cutting up the ani- 
mal, whilo the two assistants are otlierwise engaged at either end. 
Next toward the right, is another hunter in the act of dragging along 
upon a sledge his kaiak. The last person to follow has upon his sledge 
a seal w^hich has been captured. 

Apart from the ornamentation in the upper ridge, there are two seals 
visible at the left. 

Upon the reverse side of the pii)estem shown in the lower figure in 
plate 01, the regular ornamentation occurs likewise along the upper 
face, only two compartments at the extreme right being reserved for 
the figures of seals. 

Beginning at the right-hand end, and with the lower plane, a habi- 
tation, similar to the one upon the opposite side, is portrayed, the only 
difference being that there are two human figures drawn within the 
entrance to the home instead of one. 

Another figure of a man is upon the outside, seemingly leaning 
against the door, while behind him are two men in mortal combat, one 
preparing to thrust his spear, while the other has a drawn bow with 
arrow directed forward toward his victim. Some plants are shown 
upon the ground, which may have been the cause of the quarrei which 
seems to be indicated. 

Doctor A. Warburg, of Florence, Italy, kindly sent me sketches 
taken from a pipe similar to the preceding, which he founa in the col- 
lection of the American Museum of Natural History in New York 
City. An interesting pipe from St. Michaels is in the collection of the 
Georgetown College, Washington, District of Columbia. The story 
told by the etchings is the same as in plate 02, and it appears as if a 
certain person, or persons, were the author of all of these examples, the 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 861 

characteristics of the etchings being the same, as well as the general 
import of the narrative. In the Georgetown College specimen, how- 
ever, the base line above or against which are shown the figures in 
various pursuits and avocations extends from the front or bowl end 
spirally around the stem back to the mouthpiece. This is unique ^o far 
as kncnvn, and appears to be simply a fancy on the part of the maker 
to cause quicker sale of the specimen, nearly all of this class of ivory 
workmanship being made for sale to visitors. 

Plafe 24, fig, 2, is a triangularly- shaped drill bow from kSledge 
Island. It is 13i inches in length. The three sides are very full}^ deco- 
rated, the back of the bow bearing the greatest amount of work. 
The three S(}uare figures at the left represent scaftblds, upon which 
storehouses are located. Between these are two elongated figures rep- 
resenting winter habitations. Upon the house at the left are four 
human figures in various attitudes of gesticulation. The thin vertical 
line at the right of the entrance, having a small transverse scratch at 
the top, denotes a votive offering, indicating that one of the occupants 
of the house was lately deceased. Five men are seen under and about 
the second storehouse. Upon the next or second habitation from the 
left are four human beings, the larger being on all fours, as if in the 
attitude of watching those just mentioned. The next figure is occu- 
pied with some small object at a fire, the smoke of which is seen rising. 

Of the two succeeding figures, one is apparently holding a line, while 
the other appears to be occupied in some gymnastic performance. 
Beyond the next storehouse is another habitation. Beside the two 
human figures will be observed smoke issuing from the fire, and a rack 
upon which are suspended some objects, i)ossibly meat, or some other 
materials. The fourth habitatio!i from the left, somewhat larger and 
more rudely drawn than the preceding, also has upon the roof five 
individuals, with arms and legs in various attitudes. The two vertical 
lines with a horizontal jjole between them represent a meat rack, and 
the other lines indicate meat or fish. The six human figures immedi- 
ately to the right of this meat rack are placed so that the heads point 
toward the center of the record, while the feet of three rest on the bot- 
tom base line, and the feet of the other three on the top base line. 
This is intended to represent the idea of a circle, as the individuals are 
engaged in a ceremonial dance. One of them, evidently the shaman, 
is shown with three lines projecting from the head, possibly indicating 
a mask. From this point to the right end of the drill bow the record 
occupies both top and bottom lines of the illustration. Upon the 
dwelling to the right of tlie dancers are four hunum figures, one with 
a sj)ear directed toward a deer, while the individual on the top of the 
roof is pointing with one hand toward the animals, and his companion 
has both arms raised in exclamation. The square elevated structure, 
adjoining the house, represents a storehouse. At the top of the rod, 
above these human figures, is a man dragging home a seal which he 



862 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

has captured, while in front of him stands a reindeer which is being- 
shot at by a native who is armed with bow and arrow. A little farther 
to the left, upon the same line, a man is lying flat upon the ground 
with his gun directed toward the deer. Between the two elevated 
storehouses are eighteen natives in various attitudes, participating in 
a dance. At the right is a winter habitation, upon which an Indian 
stands with one hand elevated, the object in his hand evidently denot- 
ing a tambourine drum. A votive offering is shown over the entrance 
to the habitation, while to the right is seen rising a column of smoke. 
Upon the scaftbld beneath the square part of the structure represent- 
ing the storehouse is an inverted boat suspended for drying. A partly 
obliterated figure of a human being occupies the space between the 
storehouse and the end of the rod. The under sides of the bow are 
filled with figures of habitations, racks from which are suspended 
pieces of meat, and individuals occupied with various domestic duties. 
One portion of another part of the record represents an umiak going 
away from land toward some small objects which are believed to repre- 
sent seal, while on the shore are represented four men dragging at a 
large animal, possibly intended to represent a seal, and in front of them 
a dog is hitched to another seal, dragging it home to the camp, possibly 
to the left. 

Plate 64, fig. 3, also represents an ivory drill bow from Diomede 
Islands. The ornamentation shown at the left end of the illustration 
is an attempt at duplicating the peculiar zigzag markings, the simple 
form of which is shown in plate 31, fig. 4. The next oblong figure on 
four piles represents a granary or food storehouse. Xext is shown a 
human being with his arms extended in the act of making some ges- 
ture. To the right of this is a building resembling a white man's 
habitation or trader's store. The mammal to the right of this repre- 
sents a bear. Xext come the figures of two walruses, and beyond the 
middle to the right is the outline of a large bear in the attitude of eat- 
ing some mammal which he has captured at the seashore, apparently 
a seal or large fish. To the right of this is a very crude figure, some- 
what resembling a whale, with the tail elevated and the head down, 
though from the "blowholes" there appears to be some S])ray ascend- 
ing. The latter seems to be represented by dots instead of the usual 
short lines. To the right of this, upon the base line, is a long-necked 
animal denoting a seal, and beyond, at the extreme right, is a granary 
or storehouse elevated upon piles. Turning the specimen so that the 
upper line becomes the base line there will be observed at the left, to 
the right of the granary just mentioned, a figure of a seal, next two fair 
outlines of trees, and a walrus. The pointed figure, almost triangular 
in shape, appears to denote a summer habitation. The character in the 
middle of the record, apparently a scaftblding, is not clearly determin- 
able, as it seems to indicate from one point of view a granary upon a 
scaffold, but the projection at the left with two short vertical lines 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 863 

depending therefrom suggests an attempt at denoting some form of 
animal, whicli seems obscured by the square structure attached to the 
opposite line. A little farther to the left is the figure of a man with 
arms outstretched, and beyond this the body of a walrus with huge 
tusks. On the opposite side of the record, at the extreme right, is 
portrayed a rock projecting from the sea, upon which 
are resting four seals. A short distance beyond these «fff 




is seen an umiak, and toward the left a whale, from 

above the head of which is indicated by simple little '"'

triangular dots an explosion of spray, as is shown in 
the figure upon the oi)posite side of the drill bow. This is of peculiar 
interest, and indicates either inexperience in i)ortraiture on the i^art of 
the native artist or a high degree in conventionalizing. The remaining 
figures can be readily determined and need no further interpretation. 
Upon the narrow convex edge of the bow in the center of the entire 
record is the outline of another whale with the 
triangular dots for spray being arranged a little 
nearer together so as to approach more nearly the 
usual method of indicating si)ray or water thrown 
^^s''^- from the blowholes. To the right of this is a wal-

its young on its back, and other characters readily determinable by the 
reader without further explanation. The bottom of the bow bears a 
continuous seizes for more than half of its entire length of conventional- 
ized seal heads, indicating ornamentation rather than an attemj^t at a 
historical record. 

Fig. 70 represents a native picking berries. This illustration is of 
peculiar interest, as the nucleated circles ujion the short leaved stems 
denote the fruit. The same figure with the blossom, in which the three 
short radiating lines are added to denote the flower, is shown on plate 
46 in the powder measure. Upon this too are the short lines running- 
downward from the ring on the measure, to which are attached three 
berries, i. e., three nucleated circles. 

The engraving rej)resented in fig. 71 is selected from a series of charac-

ters on an ivory drill, locality unknown. The horizontal body represents 
a walrus, lying on its back, being cut up by the two men, the one at the 
left hand using a cleaver, while his companion is otherwise engaged at 
the head of the animal. The artistic execution, apparent, is extraordi- 
narily good ; the lines being deep single creases, indicating the engraver 
to have been thoroughly experienced in the use of the graver. 




864 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Two illustrations of natives cutting up reindeer are shown in figs. 72 
and 73. Both are very cleverly drawn, the limbs of reindeer being 
very naturally indicated, as assumed in dead animals. 

A very clever sketch of a native fishing through a hole in 

"xT the ice is shown in fig. 74. The hole is indicated by a small 

j^ — ^ circle while the ice itself is not shown — that being trans- 

', parent. One fish has already been caught, as shown above. 

I .^ The absence of lines to denote ice is similarly evident in the 

Fig. 74. Kolguev illustration on i)late 10. 

cATCHiNo j^ geai caught through the ice is shown in fig. 75, the hole 
being shown back of the hunter by the single form of a loop, 
as in the illustration referring to seal spearing, fig. 76, where the hole 
is again indicated by a circle on the ice line. 

This scene is taken from the Chuckche chart, 
though the drawing is evidently of Eskimo type. 
The small loop above the nose of the seal is 
simply an indication that there is a hole in the 
ice, made by the seal for breathing.

The tree-like figure at the right of the tent is smoke arising from 

the fire. The two roofed buildings are 
built in imitation of the habitations of 
white traders, one of them having a door 
at the side, and a covered portico, or 
platform, at the side.

eral subjects. In the upper half, at the right, is a summer shelter, 
within which are two figures. One is seated upon the floor, while the

otlier Las his hands extended and elevated, as if calling attention to 
something- of importance, or making the gesture for surprise. The tall 
tree-like object next to the habitation is a coluum of smoke arising 
from a heap of burning wood, visible upon the ground, while to the left, 
against the fire, is a kettle, in wbich some one is stirring with a stick. 
That the person is tired appears to be indicated by his resting his hand 
upon his knee as he leans forward toward his work. The rack, bearing 
a long horizontal pole, is next toward the left, and beneath it is a man 
hanging up fish, which has been prepared by the one at the fire. The 
individual has a piece of meat raised toward the bar, while before him 
is a vessel from which it was removed. The long net stretched from 
the left-hand scaffold pole to the end of the record is a gill net, a form 
used to set in shallow water and generally stretched at right angles to 
the shore line, in which manner more fish are intercepted than if it 
were parallel therewith. . 

The small projections above and below the net are floats and sinkers. 

Plate 6~>, fig. 2, shows a powderhorn made of antler. It was obtained 
at St. Michaels. The specimen is decorated by incisions cut length- 
wise, to both sides of 

which are attached (f^^^^ "~ "^ ^'~^- ^ # a-^

The principal figure \(r-ri^. 
shown in the illustra- 
tion represents three 
summer habitations, 
while one of the natives is occupied in suspending meat from a drying 
pole. At the left of this is a habitation beneath which is shown another 
habitation, inverted, in which are portrayed four human beings. To the 
left is a fox, or wolf, holding in its paws some small creature, evidently 
game which it has captured. The animal seems to be pursued by a bird 
of prey shown to the left, both having probably been hunting the same 
quarry. 

Plate Go, fig. 3, represents a so-called ivory box for snuff, though the 
specimen appears to be made of horn. This was obtained at Hotham 
Inlet. The specimen is divided into four different compartments by 
means of transverse lines, each line consisting of parallel incisions 
decorated as in plate 28, figs. 2 and 4. The spaces contain representa- 
tions of fish, sledges, tree ornamentations, and various other charac- 
ters, notably the outlines of a number of human beings, apparently 
dancers with rattles. 

Plate 14, fig. 2, represents a bone or reindeer-horn specimen from St. 

Michaels. Upon the lower side, at the left, is represented a boat with 

four white men carrying out supplies from a trader's store, within 

which and behind the counter stands another man with a hat upon his

Lead. To the right of this is shown another hut, about which four 
persons are occupied in i^reparing- food. One is standing over a kettle 
with a utensil in his hand, as if stirring, while another, to the right of 
the smoke, is in the act of reaching into the vessel over which he is 
occupied. At the extreme right is a meat rack. By turning the speci- 
men upside down there will be observed approaching from the left a 
native pushing a sledge, to which are attached two dogs. In front is a 
native with hands lowered and extended, as if calling to urge forward 
the dogs. At the right is a scaffold which is in connection with an 
underground habitation. From the top of one of the smoke holes is 
seen rising a heavy cloud of smoke. Two natives are ahso portrayed, 
the one at the right with arms extended, as if making signals. To the 
left is an upright pole over the entrance of the habitation, which 
represents a votive offering. 

Plate G6, fig. 3 represents a kantag or bucket handle from Xorton 
Sound. It is an old time-stained piece, and bears ujion the lateral 
edges a few sharply incised figures, that upon the right or upper side 
denoting a procession of loaded sledges. The attitudes of the dogs 
following them, as well as of the men assisting, are very natural. Upon 
the opposite side of the middle are three kaiaks, on either side of which 
are a number of seals, while at the extreme left are two low mounds 
representing winter habitations. 

In plate 67, fig. 3, l!^os. 2, 3, and 4 indicate the summer habitations 
of some natives who had gone away to catch and cure salmon. The 
fish are drying npon the racks shown in IS^os. 1 and 5; at the latter one 
the natives are hanging up fish, while at the other end of the rack is 
the ever present dog. 

No. 6 denotes the boat with three men inside, while the fourth is 
towing the vessel toward shore. 

The individual at Xo. 7 is making the gesture for calling attention to 
something whicli he has at his feet — probably a salmon. No. 8 is a 
native taking a skin of one of the dead animals, while Xos. 9 and 10 
are also going to join in carrying venison, as shown bj^ Xos. 11 and 12. 
The dog between the two last named seems to scent the meat. No. 13 
is engaged in cutting up an animal, the cut in the abdomen being shown 
by two parallel horizontal lines. Nos. 14 and 15 are dead deer, over 
which the native at the last named is busied. No. 16 is lying flat on 
his stomach, holding a gun, as beyond the hillock, No. 17, he sees a 
herd of deer, some grazing and some lying upon the ground. The rack 
at 18 is where he had a camp at a former time, showing the locality to 
have been visited before. 

The entire village appears to have turned out, as shown in plate 67, 
fig. 3, to aid in dragging ashore a whale. No. 1. Lines extend to either 
side, where groups of men are dragging at them, No. 2. The figures on 
the animal are cutting off pieces, one at the left or head end having 
raised a long slice of blubber or skin, while at the other end one of the

men is receiving a piece from another; while still another, nearer the 
tail, is tossing" a piece of the meat to a companion, whose arms are 
stretched out to receive it. 

Still another pair of natives are occupied with a large piece lying upon 
the ground. At No. 3 is a habitation, and at No. 4 the man is getting 
ready his sledges to haul the meat back to the house, where the long 
vertical ridge poles indicate that the meat is to be suspended from them. 
The natives at Nos. and 7 are also in the attitude of some occupation 
in anticipation of having meat to hang up at the scaffold at No. 0. 

The inverted quadruped near the middle of the record, and above the 
rope, pertains to a record which was to rest upon the base line, on the 
upper surface of the same side, but which was not undertaken. 

The men at No. 5 are apparently using sledge runners upon which to 
drag their umiak to the shore, so as to approach the whale from the 
water side to assist in cutting him to pieces. 

Plate 07, fig. 3, represents a number of different avocations connected 
with the chase, and the artistic portrayal of the actions represented 
are peculiarly distinct and interesting. 

The left end of the record is somewhat marred by wear, but the first 
character to be intelligible. No. 1, denotes the horns of a slaughtered 
reindeer, of which the skin, No. 2, is outstretched upon the ground. 
At No. 3 are represented the horns and forelegs of the animal, which 
have been dressed for transportation to the village. At No. 4 is the 
skin of a female reindeer, while at No. 5 is visible the hunter seated 
upon the ground and smoking his pipe. His gun and quiver of arrows 
are indicated at Nos. 6 and 7 respectively. 

No. 8 denotes a bear which has been captured by the same hunter, 
whose figure is reproduced, and his companion. No. 11 represents a 
man engaged upon the section of a temporary shelter, while the indi- 
vidual at No. 12 is using a drill bow to rotate the stick, held by No. 13, 
in the act of making fire. Nos. 14 and 1() represent a boat's crew who 
landed at the camp or shelter just named. The first of the figures is 
dragging the boat along shore, the one in the stern aiding in poling. 
No. 15 is the figure of a fish to indicate the purpose for which the party 
is away from their own home. 

At No. 17 is shown a man hanging meat u^jon the rack for drying, 
the strips of meat being visible the entire length of the horizontal pole 
to 19, which is the skin of a reindeer. The duties of No. 18 are not 
apparent, but he was evidently hel^jing in the work of suspending 
pieces of meat. No, 20 is a winter habitation, before which is one of 
the inmates. No. 21, engaged in preparing food, or something that 
requires stirring. Before him is observed rising a column of smoke, 
No. 22, while at No. 22 is another kettle belonging to No. 23, who is 
also, apparently, going to assist in the culinary work. No. 24 is a canoe 
lying upon its side, so as to dry the bottom, and behind it is seen the 
owner engaged in cleaning and repairing the side.

Tlie elongated figure at Ko. 25 is a fish net stretched out for drying. 
Other characters appear to have been uiade farther toward the right, 
but from use of the rod the surface has been worn so smooth as to 
obliterate them.

ESKIMO ATHLETIC Sl'ORTS. 



The etchings reproduced in plate G7, fig. -A, were copied from an ivory 
rod in the collection of the Alaska Commercial Comi:)any, and were 
interpreted by Vladimir 2!saomoff, a Kadiak half-caste referred to else- 
where. The left-hand figure represents a long rack from which a native 
has suspended reindeer hides, the person being x)ortrayed at the right 
as in the act of descending from a short ladder. The dome-shaped 
figure is a habitation, before the door of which is 

\*^ a square figure — perhaps a kettle — from which 

|r>s^ _£^ smoke is arising. A native is next drawn in the 
u >^T\X ^ actofsliooting a reindeer, the arrows being shown 

^°' ^^' as if sticking in its back. The continuous body- 

witli eleven pairs of horns indicates that number 
of animals. To the right are several reindeer down upon the ground, 
two having been shot Avith arrows, the native being again shown in the 
act of shooting toward a herd of ten reindeer, Avounding one which after- 
wards attacked him, and which he caught by the horns, as shown at the 
extreme right end of the record. 

The figure of the habitation Xo. 1, shown in accompanying illustra- 
tion fig. 80, has above it at the left a character resembling a cedar tree, 
but which denotes smoke. This resembles also the char- 
acter to denote spray or water as spouted by whales, illus- 
trations of which are found elsewhere. 

The individual seated over the entrance to the habita- 
tion, ]Sro. 2, is watching the amusements going on a short ^ig- 82. 
distance before him. Nos, 3 and 4 have made use of the native makin« 
fishrack poles for horizontal bars, and while Xo. 3 is astride 
of his and gesturing with his conversation with No. 2, No. 4 is making 
a turn. 

The person indicated in No, 5 is preparing to run, the two remaining 
figures in Nos, and 7 acting, perhaps, as coachers. 

Fig, 81, taken from the engravings on the ivory pipestem represented 
in plate 61, shows a native in the act of standing upon his head 
or taking a somersault. The representation is unique, and nothing 
approaching this kind of athletic sport has been elsewhere found upon 
the specimens in the collection. 

The seated figure in fig. 82 is holding with one hand a piece of wood

the pipestems shown in plate 02. The attitude of 
the men is realistic, and shows the clinch in a " catch- J|»

man at the right has kicked the ball into the air, 

while his companion is ready to catch it, as is shown by the outstretched 

hands. 

Two men engaged in gambling are shown in fig. So. That they are 
sitting close together is indicated not only by their apparent proximity 
but furthermore by the representation of the foot of one man extending 
beyond the back of his vis-a-vis. 

Whether the game is played with cards, with

i__ nable.

occurrence in records of dances, those so indi- 
cated being the observers and not the participants in the ceremonials. 
The pipe represented in the native drawing is the Siberian pattern, an 
Eskimo reproduction of the general type being shown in plates 61 and 
62, in which the bowl is a vertical stem with a broad, rather flaring top 
with but a narrow and deep perforation, resembling 
the Cliinese pattern in respect to the small quantity of t-'^ 

tobacco which the smoker can consume at one fillina-. \%c~W i . 



The effect is attained, however, as Mr. Murdoch in- rig.85. 

forms me ''that the smoker will take a deep inhalation 
of smoke — and vile smoke it is, generally — retaining it for a considera- 
ble time until he is compelled to take breath, when another similar 
inhalation of sm(»ke is taken. This is repeated until the small charge 
of tobacco is consumed. The result is a most violent fit of coughing, 

becoming spasmodic and of such apparent- 
ly painful character as to lead one to believe 
, that the poor victim is going to die at once."

usually, of two to one of tobacco, rubbed together in the palm of the 
hand and packed into the deep, narrow tube of the Catlinite pipe. 

The outer or dry part of the lips only are placed against the pipe- 
stem, and the moment a deep long pull is taken the outer corners of the 
mouth are slightly opened, without removing tlie lips irom the tip, and 
a deep breath taken in order that as the air enters the mouth some of 

the smoke held therein passes

^^^■^^* the lungs. The ex])iration is per- 

formed by expelling the smoke 
through the nostrils, at the conclusion of which another deep draw at 
the stem followed by a like inhalation, this being continued with the 
regularity of ordinary breathing, at each inspiration smoke passing 
along with the air into the lungs. 

Frequent coughing spells result and bronchial troubles are very 
common among the males. The opportunities for close observation 
were especially good during the writer's detail as surgeon at a military 
station at a time when the number of Indians upon the ration roll was 
13,500, and personal experience was abundant also, both in the method 
of making and the acquirement of a severe attack of bronchitis, though 
of but limited duration. 

The group represented in fig. 87 is actively engaged in a dance, the 
various attitudes indicating considerable exertion. The seated figure 
is holding aloft his shaman tambourine drum, the stroke across the 
disk indicating the stick with which he produces the perciussion.

DANCE AND FEAST. 

The larger figure at the right is the chief officiating personage, and 
is engaged in chanting. One hand is directed toward the drummer, 
■while the other is held aloft, in the act of sui)plicating aid from his 
daimon or guardian spirit. 

Fig. 88 is one of the very few illustrations of dances, and is perhaps 
the only one that seems to be of a social character, in consequence of a 
successful hunt. 

No. 1 is a man making the gesture for )iere^ at this place, having 
reference to the village of which he is an inhabitant and of which the 
houses are, in part, shown in Nos. 18, 20, 22, 24, and the storehouse, 
No. 23. No. 2 is obliterated, and although it appears to resemble a 
human figure, it is more probably a peak, similar to the ones shown in 
Nos. 3 and 7. Nos. 4 and 5 are the hunters who, in the shelter of 
the hill No. 7, are crawling up to within shooting distance of the deer,

resting" upon the ground at No. 8. No. C denotes a how and two arrows, 
wliile another arrow, carried by the rear liuuter, is shown above and 
between the two figures. 

The next portion of the record i)ertains to the feast given at the 
dance, the latter being graiihically portrayed in Nos. 9-17. The drum- 
mers are indicated at either end of the group of dancers, the one at No. 
being seated upon the ground, Nos. 10 and 11 are rather more 
violent in their attitudes tliau Nos. 12 and 13. No. IL' is shown with 
the right hand to the mouth to denote the gesture to eat, while with 
his left he is iiointiiig in the direction of the feast awaiting them. 
No. 13 is indicating himself, and also points to the same place as No. 
12, indicating that he too will be there. No. 14 is also shown as 
making the gesture to eat, eating, or food, while witli the other hand 
thrown backward is pointing in the direction of the habitations. No. 
15 seems to be acting in the manner of an usher, holding both hands 
toward the place of the food, as if inviting the others to go. 

No. 10 is shown with his hands up, a common attitude given to per- 
sons portrayed as dancing or other excitement, such as surprise or 
alarm in hunting, etc., wliile No. 17 has risen from his place and is using 
the drum, similar to the one at No. 9. The summer habitations are 
shown in Nos. IS, 20, and 22, the i^ersons indicated between them being- 
members of the households near which they are represented. 

No. 23 is a scaffold storehouse, while No. 24 denotes a winter or per- 
manent habitation, with one of the inmates on the roof.

WHALING SHIPS AND BOATS, AND VISITING NATIVES. 

In fig. 89 is portrayed an event which seems to have been of interest 
to the recorder, or owner of the record. Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are whaling 
ships; from No. 2 is observed a feather-like figure rising from the deck, 
between the main mast and mizzenmast, which denotes smoke rising 
from the fire used for boiling blubber. At No. 3 the line is secured to 
walrus, which is being hauled aboard. 

Nos. 4 and 6 represent ships' boats, while No. 5 is a native canoe, the 
recorder being indicated at the stem of No. 5, in the act of making a 
gesture with his left hand, and pointing with his right toward the direc- 
tion of the ship No. 1, upon which are two men, the one upon the bow- 
sprit of which is returning a gesture sign. 

The man at the stern of the last-named ship is also making a hailing 
sign to the canoe men at No. 4. 

The two crosses at No. 7 are birds, while No. 8 is the walrus which 
has been secured by the crew of ship No. 3. 



872 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

ivory of the bow. The anchor chain is seen at No. 3. Xos. 4 and (\ are 
the ships' boats in pursuit of whales, the specimen at Xo. 5 having been 
harpooned, while in No. 6 the hunter is reaching down to grasp the 
harpoon, the open hand being clearly indicated. No. 8 is a killer whale, 
while Nos. 9 and 10 denote seals diving into the sea. 

PICTOGRAPHIC RECORDS. 

This collection of records pertains more particularly to individual 
exploits — hunting and fishing, traveling and combat. It is practically' 
impossible to classify all of the records or to relegate them to a spe- 
cific subject, as the subjects are frequently not on one single theme, 
but embrace a immber of ideas upon the same continuous face of 
ivory; therefore the records are necessarily classified according to the 
import of the majority of characters inscribed. 

In the accompanying series presented below there ap[)ears to be 
more allusion to individual performances than the record of an indefi- 
nite number of people. 

INDIVIDUAL EXPLOITS. 

The carving shown in fig. 91, made of a piece of walrus ivory, was 
copied from the original in the Alaska Commercial Gompanj^, San 
Francisco, California, and the interpretations were verified by Yladimir 
Kaomolf, a Kadiak half-breed, to whom reference has already been 
made. 

No. 1 is a native whose left hand is resting against the house, while 
the right is directed toward the ground. The character to his right 
represents a "shaman stick" surmounted by the emblem of a bird — a 
"good spirit" — in memory of some departed member of the household. 
It was suggested that the grave stick had been erected to the memory 
of his wife. 

No. 2 represents a reindeer. 

No. 3 signifies that one man, the designer, shot and killed another 
with an arrow. The elbow of the arm drawing the arrow is seen pro- 
jecting behind the back, illustrating close observation on the part of 
the artist.

No. 4 denotes that tlie narrator has made trading- expeditions with a 
dog sledge. 

- No. 5 is a sailboat, althongli the elevated paddle signiiies that tliat 
was the manner in which the voyage was best made. The conspicnons 
and abrupt stem specifies that it was a heavy boat, for use in sailing, 
and not a baidarka. 

No. represents a dog sled, with the animal hitched up for a journey. 
The radiating lines in the left-hand upper corner of the square contain- 
ing the pictograph are the rays of the sun. 

No. 7 is a sacred or ceremonial structure. The four iigures at the 
outer corners of the square represent the young men placed on guard, 
armed with bows and arrows, to keep away those not members of the 
band, who are depicted as holding a dance. The small square in the 
center of the inclosure represents the fireplace. The angular lines

extending from the right side of the structure to the vertical partition 
line show in outline the subterranean entrance to the structure or 

lodge. 

No. 8 is a pine tree, upon which a porcupine is crawling upward. 

No. 9, a similar species of tree, from the bark of which a bird [wood- 
pecker] is extracting larv;\^ for food. 

No. 9 is a bear. 

No. 10 represents the owner of the record in his boat holding-aloft 
his doublebladed paddle to call for help to drive fish into a net. 

No. 11 is an assistant fisherman, one who has responded to the call, 
and is observed driving fisk by beating the water with a stick. 

No. 12 represents the net which, as is customary also among many of 
the tribes of the Great Lakes, is usually set in moderately shallo^v 

water. 

No. 13, the figure over the preceding character, denotes a whale, with 
line and harpoon attached, which was caught by the fisherman during 
one of his fishing trips.

denote its inability to progress in that direction. 

The short line in the hand of the middle hunter is an arrow, which 
is being held toward the one shooting. The figure at the left is quietly 
obser vii i g the scene, 
smoking his pipe. 

A clever and 
cleanly cut illustra- 
tion is reproduced 
in fig. 97, represent 

ing a hunter in his baidarka, paddhng toward an ice pan upon which 
is quietly reposing a walrus. 

All the figures are heavily incised by vertical lines, the ice alone 
remaining as a hollow outline to indicate its transparent or translucent 
condition. 

The illustration of the two sides of a piece of ivory, fig. 98, is from 

Utkiawifi, in the 
Point Barrow re- 
- gion of Alaska, and 
is described by Mr. 
Murdoch^ as being 
a piece of an old snow-shovel edge with freshly incised figures on both 
faces, which the artist said represented his own record. "-The figures 
are all colored with red ocher. On the obverse the figures all stand 
on a roughly drawn ground line. At the left is a man pointing his 
rifle at a bear, which stands on its hind legs facing him. Then comes 
a she-bear walk- 
ing toward the 
left, followed by 
a cub, then two 
large bears also 
walking to the 
left, and a she- 
bear in the same 
attitude, fol- 
lowed by two 
cubs,onebehind 

the other. This was explained by the artist as follows: 'These are all 
the bears I have killed. This one alone (pointing to the '' rampant'' one) 
was bad. All the others were good.' We heard at the time of his giving 
the death shot to the last bear as it was charging his comrade, who had 
wounded it with his muzzle-loader. On the reverse the figures are in 
the same position. The same man points his rifle at a string of throe 
wolves. His explanation was: 'These are all the wolves I have killed.'"

Plate 59, fig. 3, shows a drill bow from Xorton Sound. The orna- 
mentation upon one side consists of eleven wolves, wliile on the other 
side is represented a herd of reindeer, the herd being divided into two 
parts, between which is shown the figure of a wolf. 

It may be that the above instance records the fact of the owner 
being a successful hunter, and thus records a successful exploit, 
though the uniformity in outline of the animals suggests a tendency 

also toward oruameutation as 
well as portraying an occur- 
rence. 

The fungus-ash box shown on 
plate 56, fig. 5, shows along 
the upperline of illustrations a 
hunter with throwing stick and 
weapon running after some 
l)irds which he is desirous of 
securing. 

I^pon the lower line the same 
person, perhaps, is shown be- 
hind a sledge riding his dog in 
jDulling the conveyance. 

When the box is reversed, 
there will be seen upon the upper 
line a clump of trees at the 
right, while to the left of these 
is a hunter kneeling in the atti- 
tude of shooting at a bear; be- 
hind the hitter is another animal, 
perhaps a mate. 

Upon the lower line is a ship, 

toward which two native boats 

are directed. The face at the 

left is apparently simply an 

attempt at caricature. 

The hunting tablet found by Mr. Murdoch at Point Barrow, and 

before referred to, is represented in plate Qo, fig. 1. The description 

given by him is in connection with the illustration given on plate 56, 

fig. 1, referring to the reverse of the tablet. 

The accompanying illustration, fig. 99, and description is from Mur- 
doch's report on the Point Barrow Eskimo,^ and appears to be one of 
the four specimens brought back by him. The tablet is of ivory, 4.8 
inches long and 1 inch wide. On each face is an ornamental border 
inclosing a number of incised figures, which probably represent actual 
scenes, as the tablet is not new.

]\Ir. Murdoch says: 

The Hgnrcs on th(> obverse face are colored with red ocher. At the upper end, 
standing on a cross line, with his head toward the end, is a rudely drawn man holding 
his right hand up and his left down, with the fingers outspread. At his left stands 
a boy with both hands down. These figures probably represent the hunter and his 
son. Just below the cross line is a man raising a spear to strike an animal which is 
perhaps meant for a reindeer without horns. Three deer, also without horns, stand 
with their feet on one border with their heads toward the upper end, and on the 
other border near the end are two T)ucks with large antlers heading the other way, 
and behind them a man in a kaiak. Between him and the 
animal which the first man is spearing is an object which , '"'^.i • 

may represent the crescent moon. The story maj^ perhaps be '-''^ ^'- 

freely translated as follows: ''When the moon was young, 

the man and his son killed six reindeer, two of them bucks — ^ 

with large antlers. One they speared on land, the rest they 
chase I with the kaiak." 

On the reverse the figures and tlie border are colored black 
with soot. In the left-hand lower row is a she bear and her 
cub heading to the left, follow^ed by a man who is about to 
shoot an arrow at them. Then come two more bears heading 
toward the right, and in the right-hand lower corner is a 
whale with two floats attached to him by a harpoon line. 
Above this is an umiak with four men in it approaching 
another wliale which has already received one harpoon with 
its two floats. The harpoon which is to be thrust at him 
may be seen sticking out over the bow of the boat. Then 
come two whales in a line, one heading to the left and one to 
the right. In the left-hand upper corner is a figure which 
may represent a boat bottom up on the staging of four posts. 
We did not learn the actual history of this tablet, which was 
brought down for sale with a number of other things. 

Mr. W. Boyd Dawkins figures an arrow straigiit- 
ener of walrus ivory (fig. 100) which is almost an 
exact reproduction in form of that shown in plate 8, 
fig. 1. The latter is from the Diomede Islands, and 
bears the figure of a reindeer only. That shown by 
Mr. Dawkins bears along one edge a rowof reindeer, 
while at the opposite margin of the same side a 
series of seven figures, five of which resemble the 
human form, each with antler and headdress, and 
outstretched arms, from the sleeves of which are 
suspended what appears to denote fringe — short 
seri'ations. Two figures are placed in profile and in that position more 
nearly resemble reindeer rampant, though the characters are evidently 
intended to represent the same idea as that expressed in the five 
preceding ones.' 

Another illustration from the same work and author relates to a 
hunting scene, two natives being represented as in pursuit of two 
reindeer, one of which has been shot and is lying down.'^

878 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Plate 22, fig. 1, represents an ivory drill bow from Kotzebue Sound. 
The implement is 15 inches in length and seven-eighths of an inch in 
width. Besides being undulating the specimen is polished down at 
intervals of 2 inches in such a manner as to represent or produce slight 
constrictions, as will be observed from the illustration. It represents a 
hunting record, the hunter or owner of the specimen being sliown at the 
left in the attitude of shooting at a bear, which animal is accompanied 
by seven others of the same species. Some of these are separated by 
vertical lines, thus forming partitions in the record. At the extreme 
right is another illustration of whale hunting, and to intelligently un- 
derstand the engraving the bow must be turned around. The hunter is 
here represented in his kaiak, above which is an irregular circle con- 
nected with the whale by a sharply defined line. This represents a 
harpoon cord and the seal-skin float which is usually attached to impede 
the progress of the captive. The whale is represented with great 
accuracy. Above the outline of the kaiak will be seen a native draw- 
ing a bow, the arrow being directed forward toward a flock of geese, 
numbering seven, one preceding the other, in a very lifelike attitude. 

Plate 68, fig. 2, shows an old and age-stained specimen of ivory, also 
representing a drill bow, from Kotzebue Sound. The under surface is 
the one represented in the illustration. At the extreme left are five 
bear skins and a long-tailed animal which may denote the otter. To 
the rigbt of the vertical line — the line denoting the separation between 
two records — are engraved the figures of three white men, or perhaps 
only two, as the two are of the figures portrayed with the rimmed 
hats. One of these is handing a small object to his companion, whose 
hands appear to be stuck in his pockets. To the right of this individual 
are six cone-like objects connected at the apex by a continuous line, 
and between which are rude upright objects resembling columns of 
smoke. These are summer habitations, with probably indications of 
smoke from the camp fires. In the middle of the record are two cone- 
like structures, denoting mountains, between which is a semicircle 
deeply engraved with short lateral lines representing a conventional 
tree symbol with branches at either end and upon the sides. The sig- 
nification of this appears to be that between two mountain regions 
occurs an abundance of timber. This method of portraying an abun- 
dance of any thing is very similar to a common practice adopted by many 
of the Indian tribes of the United States, especially the Ojibwa and 
some of the Shoshonian tribes.^ The four triangular figures to the right 
represent huts, while a continuous line extends from the mountain 
toward the right and connects with a man disguised in a wolf skin. 
The signification of this is not clear. It may denote the act of a shanmn 
in such disguise approaching the habitations and extracting something 
therefrom, or he may intend harm to one of the occupants; or it may 

'Compare with portrayal of mountains and adjoining marsh on the "Chuckche 
Year record," in plate 81, at fig. 26.

signify that iu this disguise he was enabled to approach walruses and 
shoot them. This method of disguise was practiced by some of the 
prairie tribes of Indians west of the Mississipin IJiver. Many shy ani- 
mals may thus be approached to within shooting distance, while the 
human form would at once alarm them and cause them to escape. 
Three walruses are drawn upon the record, and as their heads are 
placed in the direction of tlie human figure, it is believed that this is 
intended to denote their capture by the hunter, this practice being 
very common. Ou the contrary, had they not been secured, their heads 
would have been placed in an opposite direction. At the extreme right 
are six bear skins upon the ground, in an upright position, very much 
resembling the conventionalized figures of skins shown in plate 22, 
fig. 3. 

On the opposite side or up]>er curve of the bow is a very rare char- 
acter; in fact, the only instance observed in the entire collection in the 
possession of the National Museum in which the pudendum is indicated. 

This character was referred to in couversation with Mr. Murdoch, 
who questioned the writer with reference to its occurrence in i)icto- 
graphs from Point Barrow. At the time of the conversation the 
engraving had not yet been observed. The creature immediately to 
the right of this is a walrus which has been harx^ooned, as the projecting 
weapon illustrates, and through it is the flying harpoon line connecting 
it with the hunter in the bow of a fine large umiak occui^ied by seven 
hunters. The next character is an umiak hurrying to the right in 
pursuit of a whale, the harpoon having been thrown forward and 
apparentlj" into the animal. The next figure is that of a human being 
with oue hand to his head and the other to his groiu, the sharply incised 
line extending downward from the middle of the abdomen. The sig- 
nification of this is not clear. Further toward the right are the out- 
lines of two kaiaks, the shapes of which are very graceful, while only 
one shows the presence of a hunter, the other being incomplete. The 
record is concluded upon this side of the bow by the figures of two 
walruses. 

Upon one side are a number of walruses and other animals, while 
near the left is the portrayal of a whale, to which the harpoon line and 
float seems attached. Some short figures are introduced to fill up the 
space. On the remaining side we have at the extreme left a seine net, 
to the right of which are several animals not identifiable Avitli certainty, 
as the engravings are very crude on this record. A number of wal- 
ruses, a whale, and a man in a kaiak occupy the greater portion of the 
remaining part of the record, while a single triangular habitation is 
shown, together with twocrudelj^ drawn figures of wolves. 

Plate 24, fig. 1, shows a drill bow from Cape Darby, where it was 
collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson. It is of ivory, and measures 13.^ inches 
in length. It is a hunting record, the story beginning at the right 
hand. The hunter is shown with gun raised, directed toward a herd of 



ggO REPORI^ OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

reindeer. Above fourteen of these animals will be observed black spots 
denoting- bullets, and indicating that that number of animals were shot 
The remaining five have no such marks, which indicates that that num- 
ber were with the herd, but were not secured. The peculiarity of this 
unique record is the indication of the bullets, each denoting capture 
of the game, whereas in most other records from the same region the 
indication of the capture of game consists in the heads of the animals 
being turned toward the hunter; those animals seen and not captured 
being turned in an opposite direction. 

By reversing the bow so as to bring to proper view the small figures 
at the left-hand upper corner, the reader will perceive at the left an 
elevated storehouse, to the right of which is a small mound represent- 
ing a winter habitation, while next to the right of this is another struc- 
ture of similar character. The main figure portrayed has a thin line 
extending from himself to one of the reindeer of the preceding group, 
indicating that another hunter captured it by means of a lasso or rope. 

On the under side of the bow is a seal-hunting scene. At the left 
are five kaiaks, four of the hunters being represented with the paddle

uplifted horizontally to indicate the X)resence of game and to call the 
attention of other hunters to the animals. To the right of the fifth 
boat is a fish. The next character represents a kaiak, the occupant of 
which also holds his paddle horizontally above him, as he is approach- 
ing two seals, and indicates to the occupants of tlie umiak to a])proach 
and capture them. One of the hunters in the umiak is portrayed with 
a gun. The figure at the extreme right represents a fish. 

On the edge of this drill bow is a series of figures apparently 
intended to fill up the space. The twelve beginning at the left repre- 
sent seals facing the right. Then come five larger animals facing the 
left, all of these apparently half iu water, their projecting heads and 
bodies very much resembling some characters used for the portrayal of 
water fowl. The next character, which is T-shaped, is a conventional- 
ized whale tail. The next character to the right is not sufficiently 
clear to admit of certain identification, but the next four represent 
deer. Beyond the vertical bar are sixteen rudely executed figures of 
seals.

In the collection from Point Barrow is one example, of wliicli an 
illustration is here reproduced in fig. 102. It is a piece of the edge of 
an old snow shovel, and measures 4.2 inches long, with a loop of thong 
at the upper edge to admit of suspension. It is covered on both sides 
with freshly incised figures, colored with red ocher, and is described 
by Mr. Murdoch as follows:^ 

The obverse, is bordered with a single narrow line. At the left is a man standing 
with arms outstretched, supporting himself by two slender staffs as long as ho is. 
In the middle are three rude figures of tents, very high and slender. At the right 
is a hornless reindeer heading to the left, with a man standing ou its back with

his legs straddled apart and his arms uplifted. Ou the reverse there is no border, 
but a single dog and a man who supports himself with a long staff are dragging an 
empty rail sledge toward the left. 
I find no mention of the use of any such scores among the eastern Eskimo. * '* * 

The engraving represented in fig. 103 is from a flat piece of the out- 
side of a walrus tusk 9.7 inches long and 1.8 wide at the broader end. 
The engravings are very crude, when compared with some of the work 
from the west coast of Alaska. The specimen is one of the four pieces 
brought back from Point Barrow by Mr. Murdoch, and the following is 
his description .2 

The figures are incised on one face only and colored with red ocher. The face is 
divided lengthwise into two panels by a horizontal line. In the upiier panel, at the 
left, is a man facing to the right and pointing a gun at a line of three standing deer, 
facing toward the left. Two are bucks and one a doe. Then come two bucks, rep- 
resented without legs, as if swimming in the water, followed by a rude ligure of a 
man in a kaiak. Below the line at the left is an umiak with five men and then 
a row of twelve conventionalized whales' tails, of which all but the first, second, 
and iifth are joined to the horizontal line by a short straight line. The record may 
be freely translated as follows: "I went out with my gun and killed three large 



'Ninth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1887-88, 1892, pp. 363, 364, fig. 363. 
sidem, p. 362, 363. 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 883 

reiudeer, two bucks, autl a doe. I also speared two large bucks iu the water. My 
whaling crew have taken ten whales." The number of whales is open to suspicion, 
as they just till up the board. 

In the above description the autlior does not state, as lie has doue in 
another instance, that tlie interi^retation was obtained from the native 
owner, and it may therefore be assumed that he ventures the interpre- 
tation Iiimself. The statement at first that the animals were deer and 
later on reindeer is confusiug in the attempt to differentiate between 
the objective portrayal by the natives of the two species of animals. 
It is evident that the reindeer is intended, because of the unusually 
long, narrow antlers and their forward direction in their position upon 
the head. It is unfortunate that no other pictographs from Point Bar- 
row are at hand, in order that satisfactory comparison with other rep- 
resentatious of deer and reindeer might be made so as to make note of the 
specific differences, as we find so elaborately portrayed in the records 
from Sledge Island, Norton Sound, and elsewhere. 

The reference to a female animal is perliaps a random one, because 
the natives of Alaska, as well as the aborigines of North America 
generally, are too cautious and matter of fact to j)ortray that which 
they do not intend. The horns upon the third animal — the doe( 1) — are 
too strikingly like those upon the two preceding specimens to denote 
anything different from them in sex. 

The statement that "the number of whales is open to suspicion" is 
worth noting, as frequently a large number of anything is denoted by 
an indefinite number of conventional indications of such objects. 
Various examples are given in which such large numbers have been 
engraved with an ornamental or decorative motive, leading one to sus- 
pect the true import intended by the recorder. A common example is 
found in the ordinary "war bonnet" of eagle plumes, worn by several 
of the so-called Prairie tri))es of Indians. The single feather is gained 
by a warrior when he either kills an enemy or is one of the first four to 
reach and touch the fallen enemy with the coup stick, a bow, or any 
other object. The act of being able to reach the enemy iu such manner 
is deemed by tlie Indian to denote that he is nearer and more in danger 
than the one who may have fired the fatal shot. After a number of 
plumes have been thus gained by a warrior, each to indicate an exjiloit 
of valor, the number becomes inconvenient for attachment to the scalp 
lock and the long plumed bonnet is permitted, provided the one so 
entitled thereto is able to purchase such a decoration, the present value 
of eagle plumes varying from $1 to $2 each. 

In similar manner an indefinite number of items, to denote many, is 
often portrayed in pictorial records of various rudely remote peoples; 
and it is probable that the above is only another instance, of which 
others are noted in the present paper. 



884 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

HUNTING AND FISHING. 

The characters iu plate G9, lig. 3, at Kos. 1, 13, aud 3, denote whales, 
while at IsTos. 4, 5, 0, aud 7 are indicated four Americau whaliug ships. 
The one at No. 7 is placed iu a foreshortened position, something sel- 
dom expected to be so reproduced by primitive peoples. 

'No. 8 appears to be an ice pan, at the base of which two men seem to 
be in tlie water with hands uplifted to attract attention; while No. 9 is 
a seal lisher hastening forward. The harpoon is seen resting upon the 
rack upon tbe fore part of the canoe, as is also perceptible iu No. 10. 
The large bodies behind the occupants of the boat are floats used to 
retard the swimming and escape of harpooned seals. 

The manner of hunting sea otter is as follows: In Alaska the Aleuts or other 
natives are the otter hunters. A large number of bidarkas take provisions for a 
day or two, and when the weather is calm, put out, often out of sight of land. When 
arrived on the banks most frequented by these animals, the bidarkas form a long 
line, the leader in the middle. They paddle softly over the water so as to make no 
disturbance. If any Aleut sees an otter's nose, which is usually the only part above 
the surface, ho throws his dart and at the same time elevates his paddle perpendicu- 
larly in the air. The ends of the line dart forward, so as to encircle the animal in a 
cordon of bidarkas, and everyone is on the watch for the second appearance of the 
otter. The same ]iroces8 is repeated until the animal, worn out with diving, lies 
exhausted on the surface, an easy prize for his captors. The skin belongs to the 
hunter avIio first struck it, or to him Avho struck nearest the head.' 

Plate 69, fig. 2. Capture of polar bear f?]. The signiticatiou of the 
illustration is that a bear was observed eating a seal, when the natives 
of the village at No. 9 went forward in the canoes, Nos. 5 and G, when 
one of the bravest made the attack with a spear. The seal is indicated 
at No. 1. 

The figure at No. 4 is not explained; while at No. 8 a canoe is still 
resting upon the scaft'old drying. 

In plate G9, tig. 1, is a record of a whale and seal hunt. No. 1 is a 
seal which has been captured by the two hunters, Nos. 2 and 3, and is 
being dragged to shore for return home. Tlie hunter is cal-rying his 
seal lance before him like a staff, while No. 3 is carrying his at a charge. 
Nos. 4, 5, and G are baidarkas with the oarsmen within, the foremost 
individual in No. 6 having harpooned a whale, which is heading away, 
spouting. The object between the boats, Nos. 5 and G, is a seal diving 
out of harm's way. The hunter at No. 8 has caught a seal, No. 10, and 
on the line is a small disk which denotes the float used. In some picto- 
graphs the disk represents the opening iu the ice, through which the 
line is dropped, altliough this may be in the air and resemble a float. 

No. 11 is indefinite, while Nos. 12 and 13 denote the summer or tem- 
porary habitations, erected for a short sojourn oidy, until the meat 
has been secured which is being placed upon the rack. No. 14, by the 
person shown at the left end, in that employment.

The vertical strokes continuing beyond this to the end of the record 
are simply ornamental, the space being deemed too small for further 
records. 

At jSTos. 1G and 17 are two baidarkas to indicate that the seal was 
captured while on a hunt by boat. 

The accompanying illustration, in plate ()9, fig. 4, represents a fleet 
of canoes, the natives having gone on a hunt, although the leading 
umiak only is shown to be engaged in harpooning a whale, No. 7, which, 
quite unusually, is portrayed with the tail projecting from the water. 
The animal in front of it is i\ seal. The No. 9 character denotes a 
seal diving out of the way. One of the men in No. 12 boat is making 
a signal of surprise to the boatmen behind, as he has observed the 
whale in sight and has thus given the alarm as well. 

No. 1 »seems to have been intended for a specific character, but may 
have remained unfinished, merely touching up the riglit-hand end so as 
to be ornamental. The two figures in Nos. 2 and 3 indicate wolves, 
the number captured by the party in the baidarka, No. 4. No. 5 is a 
whaler observed by the hunters.

RIVAL WHALE HUNTERS. 



An illustration of rivalry in hunting the whale is given in fig. 104, 
but the sequel does not appear. The two boats were pursuing the same 
animal, which is shown spouting, and the harpoon throwers are in the 
attitude of casting their weapons at the same instant. 

The etching is strongly and artistically executed. 

Plate 64, fig. 2, represents a very old ivory bow drill from the Dio- 
mede Islands. The specimen is actually brown with age and bears 
incisions upon four sides. The surface shown in the illustration bears 
at the left a large umiak in which are four hunters, the one in the bow 
being represented as throwing a harpoon toward an approaching 
whale. Beyond this figure is a hunter in his kaiak who has thrown 
his harpoon at a whale, the latter being represented with the head pro- 
jecting vertically from the water. The short irregular character in the 
stern of the kaiak represents the inflated seal-skin float. Two other 
whales in this upright position are shown to the right of the above 
mentioned, and they are approached from the right by two hunters in 
a large umiak, the one in the bow being also represented as having 
cast a harpoon, the line extending from his hands to the animal. At 
the extreme right is a hunter in his kaiak. Upon the opposite side of 
the specimen, beginning at the left, is a walrus being dragged forward 
by four men. To the right of this group are shown four kaiaks each 
with its hunters, and each hunter having his harpoon elevated horizon- 
tally above his head as in the act of throwing. Behind the hunters 



38g REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

are represeuted the usual figures of tlie inflated seal skins used in 
connection with the liarpoon line. Three large figures of walruses 
are next shown, upon the back of the first being portrayed a young 
one. At the right of the upright walrus is an umiak containing four 
hunters who are traveling toward the right in pursuit of a whale, 
towards which the hunter in the bow of the umiak is casting his har- 
poon. Upon the upper narrow edge of the'rod are a number of small 
figures, at the extreme left six natives being shown, each with one arm 
elevated, and a small line extending from the hand to the head, very 
much suggesting the use of the pipe as in tlie act of smoking. Three 
seals are next drawn, beyond which are two kaiaks, and beyond these 
the figures of six seals. The entire series of characters are arranged 
with such apparent regularity as to suggest more of an attempt at 
ornamental decoration tlian the portrayal of any experience in hunt- 
ing. The narrow face opposite to this bears two horizontal parallel 
lines within which are a number of narrow cross lines and two circular 
indentations, neither of which appear to have any special significance 
further tlian an attempt at simple ornamentation. 

Another illustration of whale and seal hunting is given in plate 70, 
fig. 1. The four creatures indicated by No. 1 are seals, toward which 
the native in the canoe is paddling, No. 2. Above him is a small cross 
denoting a bird in flight. The spouting whale, shown in No. 3, is har- 
pooned by the man in the bow of the baidarka. No. 4, while the man 
behind him is holding aloft his catch — a large fish — wliile with his right 
hand he is also calling attention by the gesture of surprise. The others 
in the boat are paddling to keep up with the whale. 

Nos. 5 and appear to be seals, although the latter resembles more 
nearly the smaller whales, as drawn in other pictographs, yet this can 
scarcely be, as the hunter, No. 7, is lying upon the ground and resting 
his gun upon a ridge or rock, in the attempt to shoot the animals. 

The hunter at No. 8 is stealthily coming up to No. 7, carrying a gun 
or lance. 

No. 9 denotes three seals, while No. 10 is a hunter awaiting their 
approach, he lying behind a small heap of what, by its remaining 
untouched by the graver, would appear to be ice. 

No. 11 is a boat being carried out of the water, a whale. No. 12, hav- 
ing been killed and ready to be cut up. No. 13 is a baidarka containing 
some returning whales, while No. 14 is a seal, the hunter taking it to 
his habitation at No. 15, the interior view being disclosed, showing 
within two of the hunter's family, one seated upon the floor while the 
other is addressing some words to him, or her, as denoted by the atti- 
tude of the hands. Another permanent dwelling is indicated at No. 
16, the smoke rising out of the smoke hole, while the owner is at the 
side entering into conversation with the others because of the return 
of the lucky hunter. 
The accompanying fig. 105 is interesting because two difterent pur-

suits are represented, one being interrupted in order to i)rosecute 
another. The natives hud gone out in their baidarkas to tish, as indi- 
cated by the middle figure of No. 2 group holding up two fish which 
had been caught, and the man No. 4 also having a large salmon (?\ 
attached to a i)ole. A whale was observed spouting, No. 1, when the 
boatmen started after him, the foremost one darting his harpoon into 
the animal while the one on the stern began to make signals, calling to 
his companions that there was game in sight. The signal is the com- 
mon one of holding aloft, horizontally, an oar so that it may be seen by 
those toward whom it is held and intended to be seen. The signal was 
observed, as we j)erceive in No. 3 the three men pushing into the water 
the baidarka, lying on its side, the middle man holding the harpoon 
while the one at the right is j)ushing at the vessel. No. 4, as already 
stated, has a fish attached to a polej No. 5 is making gestures, also 
calling to others to come, while No. 6 is seen walking toward the shore 
with a rod, probably intended for an oar. 

The three small crosses in a horizontal line above No. 3 denote birds 
dying in air. 

Plate 06, iig. 1, consists of a short ivory handle for carrying a kantag 
or bucket. It is a very old, yellowish-brown piece of ivory, and was

obtained at St. Michaels. The engraving is characteristic of the locality, 
being deep and boldly cut. Upon the upi)er surface shown in fig. 1 
appears an umiak with four hunters, the one in the bow preparing to 
throw his harpoon toward a whale. In front of the latter is another 
umiak, the man in the bow of which is also throwing his harpoon to a 
whale, M'hile in front of the latter is a projecting fluke, indicating an 
animal of similar species descending into the water, while to the right 
is an umiak, the occupant of which is endeavoring to throw his harpoon 
into the whale just referred to. At the extreme right is another umiak 
with four men, the one in the bow al.so harpooning a whale. The head 
of the latter is drawn very much in imitation of a tuskless walrus, and 
might be mistaken for that animal, or a seal, but for the spray of water 
which is represented as being thrown from the blow holes. "Turning 
the handle around, we perceive advancing from the right two umiaks with 
masts erect, upon which are several indefinite figures. A little farther 
on, however, is shown a whale to which a line is attached, indicating 
that he has been harpooned, while the shapeless figure referred to may 
possibly indicate the inflated skin which is always attached to impede 
progress in the case of an escaping monster of this kind. The carious 



888 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

ligure a short distance above the whale and directly opposite to the 
fluke spoken of in the record above, represents an island with its ele- 
vated center and precipitous sides. Upon the other side of the top 
carving the drawings are a little more delicate. Two of the most con- 
spicuous characters on the left side represent seal nets. The two 
umiaks are proceeding in the direction of a whale which appears to 
liave been harpooned, as at the end of a long thin line there appears 
attached the usual float. The figure at the extreme end is that of a 
seal, while the one to the left of it may be another animal of the same 
species. Between the latter and the whale is a very small and very 
delicately drawn kaiak. The man represented has a paddle, while a 
spear projects backward and upward behind him. 

On the under surface of the bow, between two parallel lines but a 
quarter of an inch aj)art, are about twelve characters denoting various 
animals which the hunter wishes to intimate he has killed. Some of 
them can be identified, while others can not, the drawing being rather 
crude. 

The specimen shown in plate 59, fig. 2, is from Cape Prince of Wales, 
and represents a variety of hunting records. Beginning at the left 
hand along the lower edge is visible a very crudely carved figure of a 
native with a spear, following two bears. To the right is a native 
kneeling, preparing to shoot. The next four figures represent umiaks 
loaded with native hunters going to sea. These are followed by the 
figure of a whale which is being harpooned by the hunter in the bow of 
an umiak immediately to the right. The next figure is that of a dog, 
and the next a native who has hold of a thong by which he is leading 
another dog. Then we observe a hunter dragging a seal, while a short 
distance above this are small crosses representing birds. The next is 
a walrus, to the right of which is a dog dragging a sledge upon which 
is seated the owner. Turning the bow around, we perceive at the left 
four >-shaped figures, indicating the end of both records. The first 
figure projecting froin the base line is a whale's fluke, then several 
small figures to represent walruses, then two men are observed grasping 
hands, with apparently a spear between them. A large umiak is shown 
in front of another walrus, two of the hunters in which have raised 
their spears to cast toward some walruses lying upon a floating cake 
of ice. To the right of these animals is represented a seal being 
dragged by three hunters. These are preceded by another group of 
three, who are also dragging home a seal. A single native is next 
shown, with a line directed to a spot near the base line, which denotes 
a seal's head. The large fin-like character represents a fluke, as in the 
first figure of this record. An umiak is then shown, one of the natives 
in wliich is in the act of harpooning a whale, while a native in one of 
the other umiaks has also a line attached to him. The record is con- 
cluded by another umiak containing four men pursuing a walrus. 
Upon the under side are a number of illustrations of hunters, some 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 889 

harpooning walrnses, while others appear to be after some reindeer 
who have taken to the water. Along the narrow edges are also repre- 
sentations of various objects, one side being filled more than half of 
its length by a procession of dog sledges, the remainder being filled 
with sealers upon ice floes, a whale, and some boatmen. The other 
edge represents some very deeply incised and graphic outlines of boats 
and marine hunters, the record terminating at one end with some flying 
birds, while at the other two individuals dragging a seal are shown. 

Plate 22, fig, 5, is a drill bow from Kotzebue Sound. The specimen 
measures lOi inches in length. A sectional view of the specimen is 
lozenge shaped, so that there are both above and below two faces upon 
which records are engraved, making a total of four records. As repre- 
sented in the illustration, the record upon the lower side consists of 
seal and whale hunting scenes. At the extreme left is a rude outline 
of an umiak, within which are crude representations of human beings. 
The vessel is very close upon an immense whale, which is evidently 
escaping from them in the direction of another umiak ^^hich appears 
to be approaching it. The oblong figure to the right of the last named 
umiak is an inverted boat x>laced upon scaffolding for the ])urpose of 
drying. Some partly eroded figures are seen between the bow of the 
boat and three men, one above the other, who are portrayed in the act 
of dragging home an immense seal. Beyond this are three umiaks 
filled with hunters, while still farther to the right are two or three 
walruses swimming in the water. To the right of the last named is a 
figure very much resembling the conventional outline of a wolf, while 
beyond that, to the right, is a low elongated structure, heavily etched, 
which represents a winter habitation. Above the entrance is a human 
figure, with arms extended, as if attracting attention to something. 
Beyond this structure, to the right, is a very delicately engraved scaf- 
fold, upon which food or other similar materials are placed for safety. 

Along the upi)er surface of this bow, beginning where the previous 
story ended, we find a storehouse erected on stilts attached- to the ordi- 
nary winter habitation, upon and about which are the outlines of some 
human beings. A food rack is erected above the entrance to this habi- 
tation, from the horizontal bar of which are suspended objects which 
are probably pieces of meat or fish, as the occupants appear to be seal 
hunters, two of them being represented in the act of dragging home 
seals. Just to the right of this is a grazing deer whose legs are 
unnaturally long, and in front of this is an umiak holding four hunters. 
The two small figures to the right of the last named are seal heads 
protruding from the water. Beyond this is another umiak with four 
hunters whose arms are in various attitudes as if in earnest conversa- 
tion. The small mound like figure at the bow of this boat represents 
the shore, and immediately to the right are shown three natives drag- 
ging home upon its back a huge seal. Beyond this animal are other 
hunters similarly engaged. The oblong outline somewhat resembling

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



a canoe lying on its side can not be determined. To the right of this, 
however, is another lignre of a seal being dragged toward the right, 
and approaching two men whose arms are uplifted as if in joy at 
receiving assistance. The partly obliterated figure of a human being 
is seen approaching the entrance to one of the ordinary winter habita- 
tions, from the door of which, as well as from the middle portion,

appear two vertical sticks with small figures at the top, both repre- 
senting votive ofl:erings. The scafibld at the right represents a store- 
house used for food or grain. 

In fig. 100 is presented another illustration of the indication, picto- 
rially, of what the hunter desired, or saw, and how much thereof he 
secured. The three men in the baidarka are headed toward two whales, 
the foremost one of the former, he in the bow, being represented in the 
act of casting a harpoou, the dotted line iridicating the course. The 
whale struck by the weapon is headed toward the hunters, indicating 
that he was captured : whereas the second whale is going i]i the con- 
trary direction, denoting that he had been observed and very much 
wanted, perhaps, but not captured. The short projections above the 
heads of the whales denote fins — and seem thus to specify the finback. 

The cruciform figures 
denote flying birds. 

A xjeculiarly inter- 
esting specimen of art 
is illustrated in fig. 
107, and consists of a 
fiat piece of ivory, 4 
inches long and 1.2 
inches wide, roughly 
carved and covered 
with incised figures. 
The specimen is made 
of a fragment of an 
old snow- shovel edge, 
is perforated at one end, and has attached to it by a strand of sinew a 
little handle formed of ivory, and represents two bowhead whales with 
the heads attached, so that a slight stricture results, about which the 
cord is tied. 
The spiracles on the effigies are incised and blackened. 
"The upper edge is carved into five distinct heads— first, a rude 
bear's head, with the eyes and nostrils incised and blackened as usual; 
then four human heads, with a face on each side. The front faces have 
the noses and brows in low relief, and the eyes, nostrils, and mouths

incised aud blackened; the back ones are flat, with the last three 
features indicated as before. At the end is a rude figure of a bear, 
heading toward the right, with the ears in relief, the eyes and mouth 
roughly incised and blackened, aud the legs indicated b^^ roughly 
incised and blackened lines on the obverse face. Both faces are cov- 
ered with rudely incised and blackened lines. 

^'On the obverse there is a single vertical line between eacli pair of 
heads. Below the bear's head is a bear heading toward the right; 
under the first human head, an umiak with four men; under the sec- 
ond, a 'killer'' (Orca) heading toward the right: under the tliird, two 
of the usual conventionalized whales' tails suspended from a cross line; 
and under the last, a 'killer' with very large 'flukes' heading toward 
the left. 

"On the reverse there are, below the bear, a bear heading toward 
the right, below each of the human heads a whale's tail with the flukes 
up. and under the bear's head a bear heading toward the right." ^ This 
end is perforated as before stated. 

Fig. 108 represents a village near a stream, or the seashore. !Nos. 1 
and 3 are habitations, while the structure at No. 2 represents a store-

house, a box-like receptacle built upon poles within which to store food. 
Upon the entrance way of No. 3 is seen a man occupied in some ordi- 
nary occupation, but at his left is a vertical pole upon which is a short 
transverse line, the effigy of a bird or fish, most probably the former. 
This is a votive oft'ering, or "shaman stick," erected to the memory of 
a departed member of the family. Bird carvings are deemed the best 
that can be selected, flying spirits or demons, typified by birds, being 
considered good omens, whereas walking or crawling ones are often 
malevolent. 

To the right of the man, over the entrance to the habitation, is another 
"shaman stick," erected probably with the same motive as the preced- 
ing one, though to indicate a second person, only one stick being erected 
to one individual at the same place. 

The four figures seated upon the ground at the water's edge — Xos. 
4-7 — denote four persons fishing, the floats being visible on the lines of 
Nos. and 7. 

Fig. 109 represents a party of fishermen, the three figures at the 
right benig in a seated posture. Considerable surf\ice erosion by con- 
stant use has weakened the lines at the left side to such an extent as

to make interpretation more difficult. The long upright lines may have 
been intended to denote rods, as a similar line in the hands of No. 6 is 
known to be. 

No. 3 may liave had a rod and line attached to his hands, as in Nos. 
6 and 7, but the surface here is perfectly smooth and polished, thus 

obliterating all evidence 
of such implements. 
As many of the ivory 

drill bows and bag handles 

have inscribed uiion them 
records of seal hunts in 
which are found engrav- 
ings of natives dragging seal, it seems proper, if not necessary, to 
illustrate the utensil with which the dragging is performed. Fig. 110 
represents a seal drag, an article with which every seal hunter is pro- 
vided and carries with liim for dragging home his game. This consists 
of a small ivory handle or knob, to which is secured a stout thong 
doubled at the other end in a bight about 18 inches long. The bight is 
looped into an incision in the animal's lower jaw^, while the knob serves 
for attaching a longer line or the end of a dog's harness. The seal is 
dragged on his back, and runs as smoothly as a sled. The illustration 
of the drag referred to above is one 
of a small collection in the National 
Museum, and marked as from I'oint 
Barrow.^ 

Some of these ivory knobs show 
slight markings or incisions to serve 
as ornamentation, as shown in plate 
20, fig, 3, though the greater ni\mber 
are carved in symmetrical forms, and 
usually in imitation of seals, whales, 
or something of this kind. 

Floats of inflated seal skin are used 
in capturing wliale and walrus. An 
excellent specimen from Point Bar- 
row,^ fig. Ill, will serve to illustrate 
the general appearance of the float, 
and will furthermore serve to make 
intelligible the peculiar fish-like ob- 
ject portrayed on some ivory records, where the seal fisher is repre- 
sented as in his kaiak, with the harpoon and float projecting backward 
from the body. The accompanying illustration is here reproduced from 
the Point Barrow report by Mr. Murdoch. 
The village in plate 70, fig. 2, is located at Nos. 1 and 2, the store-

Louse being at the extreme left eud. of tlie first bouse. Smoke is 
rising from the middle elevation, while upon the entrance are two 
persons, one of whom is shown with his arms elevated, as if hailing 
some one, while the second appears to be in conversation with the man 
on the scaffold belonging to the next house, at jSTo. 2. On the latter 
are two people pulling up a ladder to get the hunter to bring up the 
meat, when the seal, dragged by No. ."i, is eaten up. The hunter's dog is 
following. No. 4 denotes two men pulling at a seal, while those at No. 
i) are similarly engaged. Nos. G, 7, S, and i> are also taking home their 
captures. The flgure in the air, between Nos. 7 and 8, resembles the 
usual outline of an evil spirit, as portrayed in connection with cere- 
monial performances of shamans, but in the present connection the 
import of the character is unintelligible, unless the artist intended to 
represent one of the natives in the act of juini^ing. 

No. 10 denotes two seals. No. 11 a water bird, while No. 12 indicates 
a canoe with the rowers standing about in conversation, in which the 
inhabitants of No. 13 are participating. 




Fig. 111. 

INFLATED SEAL-SKIN FLOAT. 

No. 14 is the storehouse or scaffold belonging to the occupants of 
No. 13. 

Plate 22, flg. 5, represents another drill bow or bag handle from 
Kotzebue Sound. The square object on poles, at the right end upper 
line, represents a cache or granaiy, while the dome-shaped structure is 
a winter habitation, on the entrance to Avhicli is a native with his arm 
directed downward, as- if indicating that place for some particular 
reason. The next character represents a scaffold used for drying meat 
or fish. Two men are represented as api^roaching the rack, both 
dragging an oddly formed character, probably intended to represent 
a seal. The mammal is a reindeer, while to the right is an umiak 
containing four men approaching two figures, the forms of which are 
not sufficiently distinct to identify. 

Beyond these, however, are two seals whose heads are seen protrud- 
ing from the surface of the water. Another umiak is shown, beyond 
which three men are shown dragging a seal or walrus. Tliese are 
folio wetl by three others similarly occui)ied. The dome- shaped figure 



394 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

to the right denotes, without doubt, a similar animal upon an ice floe, 
the latter being indicated by its having been left white to denote trans- 
parency. 

One man is seen dragging at a seal to the right of the tioe, and a little 
farther on are two men making gestures, the first having both hands 
and arras directed upward, while the second has one arm directed to 
the left of the rod, while with the other the hand is flexed toward his 
head, as if beckoning to some one at his left and indicating the direction 
to his right. 

The walrus have been surprised by hunters, as shown in plate 70, 
fig. 3, many of them swimming away, as shown in No. 3, one animal 
having its young still resting upon its back. The ice pan at No. 2 has 
three animals remaining upon it, a young walrus at its mother's back 
being indicated in the middle figure, while the largest figure is already 
harpooned, its flippers (!) being extended in its endeavor to slip into 
the sea and escape. The middle boatman in No. 4 is holding aloft his 
paddle, thus calling for assistance, the signal being visible, perhaps, by 
other hunters, who will at once respond. In No. 5 the hunter had har- 
pooned his walrus, which immediately attempted to escape by resorting

to an ice pan, upsetting the canoe and dragging it uiion the ice, and at 
the same time throwing into the water the unfortunate hunter, w4iose 
head and shoulders are seen projecting above the base line, here indi- 
cating, also, the water line. 

In fig. 112 is shown a remarkably graphic illustration. The artist 
was of more than ordinary cleverness, and the engraving scarcely 
requires any description. The animals noted in No. 1, the middle one 
on the ice pan in No. 5, and the one to the right — the last but one — are 
each shown with their young upon the back. 

The ice pan upon which the animals liad been floating is indicated by 
an outline only, the body being left white and i)i imitation of nature. 

Plate 21, fig. 2, represents the back of bow shown elsewhere. As 
before, there is an upper and lower face upon which hunting records 
are portrayed. Beginning with the upper surface at the right-hand 
side, we perceive four walruses, to the right of which is an umiak occu- 
pied by four hunters. The one in the bow appears to have a short- 
handled ax, while the second has one arm uplifted, and directed forward 
from the mouth appears a short line terminating in zigzag, which is 
believed not to be accidental but intentional, and indicates voice or 
speech, sound being portrayed in other pictographs as well, seemingly

iudic.iting tliis extent of ac<iiiaintancc with the reeortliiig' of subjective 
ideas. The third ])ersou in the boat is using the paddle, wiiile the one 
at the stem has a weapon of some kind with which he is attempting to 
keep off an aggressive walrus which is following them. 

To the riglit of this is another umiak paddling toward the right in 
the direction of the three walruses represented. Above the middle 
of this is a small cross which denotes a bird. The next figure rej^re- 
sents an umiak in whicli are four people close to the body of a whale 
which has been harpooned. The elongated curved figure resting upon 
two short vertical lines represents a boat on shore and on a scaffold 
drying. At a distance of about 14 inches from this is shown a whale 
in the act of diving, as is intimated by the fact of the greater portion 
of the body being directed upward while the head is down in the water, 
as shown by the spray which emanates from the blowhole in contact 
with the surface. The oblong cross above this represents a bird. The 
adjoining characters to the right can not be definitely determined. 
The figures at the end, however, represent two winter habitations with 
the accompanying granaries and the presence of human figures. 

Turning the bow around and following the remaining faces from the 
left hand, we find first a winter habitation with smoke rising from the 
center, in front of which is a tent witli a vertical pole projecting upward 
atthe right. A native is seen dragging home a seal, while to the right 
are more human figures apparently embarking in umiaks, three of these 
vessels being under way. Beyond the bow of the right-hand boat and 
upon the base line are two figures whicli represent seals, while of the 
two in the air the one at the left represents a fox or wolf and that at 
the right a bird. The remaining half of the space upon this bow is 
filled with a procession of natives dragging home seals, eight of these 
animals being shown. The vertical sticks used by these natives are 
seal spears, which they employ to aid locomotion. 

Plate 24, fig. 3, represents a drill bow from Nubuiakhchugaluk, 
collected by Mr. E. W. ISTelson. 

The specimen measures 12yV inches in length, and is rudely decorated 
both above and beneath. The figure at the extreme left is partly 
obliterated. The next represents a native in his kaiak in the act of 
throwing a harpoon toward a walrus, which he is closely pursuing, and 
beyond which are four other animals of the same species. The next 
figure represents an umiak with three occupants, the one nearest the 
bow being represented as in the act of throwing a harpoon. Two large 
crude figures of walruses are between this boat and another umiak, in 
which are three persons, the one at the stern being shown with the 
rudder, the one in the middle having both arms extended and upward 
as if in surprise, and the one at the bow being in the act of throwing a 
harpoon toward a whale. Above this are five birds, indicated by crude 
crosses. To the right of the whale is a native with bow and arrow, 
preparing to shoot toward a reindeer. The triangular figure to the 



896 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

riglit of tlie reindeer appears to be a summer habitation, wliile the 
iigure of a mammal at the extreme right is not drawn with sufficient 
accuracy to admit of identification. The under side of the bow con- 
tains characters the import of which is very much the same as that of 
those just enumerated. The edges of the bow are decorated with hori- 
zontal incised lines. 

The record given in plate 60, fig. 2, embraces several diiferent 
exploits. In No. 1 the helmsman at the end of the large canoe is hold- 
ing aloft the double-bladed paddle to attract attention and to call for 
assistance, as a walrus, No. 2, is making an attack upon the native in 
the kaiak, No. 3. The leaning figure in the stem end of the kaiak is 
the inflated seal skin used as a float in hunting whale and walrus. 
No. 4 is rock and indicates shore, near which is No. 5, a large animal. 
The canoe party at No. G are also making signals, seals having been 
discovered: No. 9, toward which the native in the kaiak. No. 8, is 
going, having already thrown his harpoon as indicated by the weapon 
before the bow, and securing one seal as noted by the harpoon pro- 
truding from its .back. 

Both boats are near a large rock showing a water-worn cavity, as 
in No. 7. 

Another native, armed with hari)oon and float, is paddling along at 
No. 10. The figures at No. 11 and 12 are either partly worn away or 
incomplete and are unintelligible. 

The regularity with which the hunters and their captured seals are 
depicted in iflate 00, fig. 3, is a step in the direction of the decorative — 
representation of a hunting exi)loit. 

Each of the hunters has secured an animal, the hunter dragging 
No. 2 seal having a bow and arrow while the others have harpoons, 
the weapon being cleverly indicated by the barbed head in the hands 
of the native dragging seal No. 10. 

Fourteen seals were secured, only one getting away from the slaughter, 
as indicated in No. 15. 

The illustration in plate 60, fig. 4, is interesting because of an attempt 
at perspective. Tbe record was too comprehensive to be engraved upon 
the ivory surface available, and as there were more canoes employed in 
the hunt than could be drawn along one line, in consecutive order, three 
of them are raised to appear as if they were in the air, though in reality 
beyond the two touching the water line in the foreground. The canoes 
at No. 2 are for one person only, while that at No. 3 has nine people in 
it. The walrus, which the party is evidently going to attack, are at 
No. 1. Nos. 4 to 11 embraces the habitations referring to the fact that 
a village is located there, while the scaffolds— with the exception of No. 
6— are for canoes, the vessels being inverted and the paddles ])r()iecting 
beneath. The exception referred to is a food scaffold, to which a flight 
of steps has been placed. Two persons are observed on the roof of the 
house at No. 5, watching the departure of their friends, while a short

columu of smoke is seen arisino- from the middle elevation of the habi- 
tation. 

At No. 4, food is seen suspended beneath the inverted boat, while 
above it the harpoon is projecting, showing that the weapon is kept 
near at hand for immediate use, should occasion demand it. 

The engraving in plate 70, fig. 4, presents interesting details in the 
portrayal of various attitudes assumed by walrus Xos. 4, 7, 9 and 11, as 
well as the specific difi'erence between 
the canoes, the baidarka holding more 
than one person, and the kaiak, gen- 
erally, but for one i)erson. The former 
is shown in various styles, as ISTos. ], 2, 
and 3, while the latter is represented in 
Nos. 0, 8, 10, 11', 13, and 14. The small 
cross above No. 3 denotes a bird in 
flight, as also the two figures of like 
form above the seal at No. 7. A lai'ge 
water fowl still remains upon the water 
before the bow of the kaiak at No. 8. 

The hunter in the kaiak No. (5 has 
thrown his harpoon into a walrus, while 
the occupants of Nos. 10 and 12 have 

raised their weapons preparatory to throwing them. The elongated 
objects i)rojecting from the kaiaks, behind the occupants, Nos. 10, 12, 
and 13, are inflated seal skins used as floaters for the harpoon line, 
to impede the speed of the harpooned animal, and also to jjrevent 
its escape by remaining too long underwater or to 
trace its course while there. 

TRAVEL AND GEOGRAPHIC FEATURES. 

Locomotion by boat is graphically represented in 
many records and by sledge in occasional instances. 
Walking with the seal spear used as a cane is com- 
mon, and in one exami)le age is also indicated by 
the attitude of the bent body, a method of portray- 
ing physical condition seldom found in Eskimo picto- 
graphs, but of frequent occurrence in the records 
of the Ojibwa and Dakota. 
Fig. 113 is reproduced from a small slab of wood, 
and is explained as follows: 

Seal hunters thus inform their comrades that they have returned 
home : The first to return to the regular landing place sometimes sticks 
a piece of wood into the ground leaning toward the village, upon which 
is drawn or scratched the outline of a baidarka or canoe heading toward 
one or more outlines or lodges, signifying that the occupants have gone 
toward their houses.

898 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

lu this coimectioii may be mentioned a commou device used by the 
natives of southern Alaska and Kadiak to indicate direction taken or 
to be taken. When hunters become separated the one first return- 
iiio- to the forks of the trail puts a piece of wood in the ground, on the 
ton of which he makes an incision, into which a short piece of wood is 
secured horizontally so as to point in the direction taken. 

This device is sometimes drawn upon ivory and other materials, in 
connection with -other objects to make pictographic records, and then 
simply represents a character like the letter T, the upper crosspiece 
being veiy sliort in comparison Avith the vertical stroke. 

The practice of erecting such sticks to indicate direction is very com- 
mon to the tribes living along the Great Lakes, especially the Crees 
and the Ojibwa. 

Plate 25, fig. 2, represents a snuffbox of walrus ivory. This speci- 
men, which was obtained at Xorton Sound, is crude and very old. Upon 
the upper border or margin is a line encircling the specimen, upon 
which is a series of very interesting although crude figures. The only 
engraved character below the line, upon one side, is a very rude sledge 
attached to a long-necked dog. 

The pipe represented in plate 71 measures lOi inches in length along 
the lower outer curve, while the ornamental head in front is 1 inch in 
length. The latter is easily removed, being merely an ornamental head 
of the peg used to plug the drilled tube of the pipestem. The stem is 
three fourths of an inch in lateral diameter and about Ih inches through 
the stem at the back of the bowl— from top to botton). The bowl and 
its supporting stem is li inches in height. Upon either side of the rim 
of the bowl is a carved human face with blackened eyes and mouth, 
the nose being quite pronounced. 

The engravings occupy the four sides of the stem, the two lower 
panels being reserved for boating scenes, while the upper are retained 
for game and village scenes. Upon the upper right-Iian<f side are six 
reindeer, followed by a wolf, while before the foremost reindeer is the 
figure of a man in the attitude of following sea fowl, evidently in the 
attempt to secure some. 

Beneath this scene is a fleet of eight umiaks, under rail, while in 
each vessel are the outlines of human figures, one at the bow of the 
leading umiak reaching toward, or grasping, the foresail stay, while 
every helmsman has his oar to steer his boat. In tlie fifth boat — forward 
from the mouth]iiece of the pipe — is one native smoking his pipe. 

On the left-hand side, in the lower space, are six kaiaks, each having 
its occupant using the ])addle, while toward the stem is seen projecting 
the harpoon and seal-skin iioat, ready and inflated for use. 

The upper space portrays a village scene, in the middle being the 
dome-shaped winter habitation, from which smoke is issuing; three 
persons upon the roof of the entrance are watching the return of the 
liunters, one raising his arms as if hailing the latter with pleasure at 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 899 

their safe or successful return. The hunters are at the left dragging 
along their kaiaks upon sledges. The figure x)laced upon stilts is an 
umiak, suspended for drying and protection, while beneath it is a dog 
and his master approaching the entrance of the habitation. 

At the right is a storehouse or granary, built above the ground, and 
near it a man <;alling or urging forward tlie dog hitched to the sledge, 
upon which is placed a load and one person. 

The artistic execution of the engravings is good. The lines are very 
uniform in depth and width, showing the artist to have been an expert 
in the use of the graver as pertains to the mechanical part of the 
etching, at least. 

The lines are all tilled in or stained with a very black substance, 
giving the work rather a harsh and new appearance and not so soft 
and warm in tone as some of the older and more worn specimens. 

The engraving in i)late 40, fig. 1, is very bold and seems to present 
strong evidence of perspective drawing, not through mere accident but 
from intention. The gradual diminution in the size of the buildings 
and store racks at the left end of the record is very cleverly done. 
The figure at No. 9 is a baidarka inverted ui^on the rack so as to permit 
it to dry, while the rod upon the entrance to the house at ^To. 8 is a 
votive offering, erected to the memory of one of the household. The 
man upon the roof is si^eaking and gesticulating to those at No. 6. 

The parties in the canoes, Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13, are leaving to visit 
another village, indicated by a large habitation and storehouse, Nos. 
14 and 15, about whicli the four hunniu figures are portrayed as making 
gestures, both beckoning — by the hand raised — and pointing to the 
house, as if desiring the visitors to come there. 

There is no evidence of want of food, or death, as indicated in some 
other records presented herein, but simply an exhibition of gladness at 
the return of friends or visitors who appear to have come within hailing 
distance. 

The excitement caused by the arrival of two whaling ships is cleverly 
portrayed in plate 40, fig. 2. At No. 1 is a baidarka still upon the dry- 
ing poles, while the natives at No. 2 are excitedly rushing toward it to 
put to water and to follow the other boats already under way to visit the 
ships. The boats Nos, 3 to 7 are all going along toward the anchored 
craft, Nos. 8 and 9, the anchor chains being designated by zigzag lines, 
thus more emphatically indicating linJcs. 

The canoes at Nos. 10 and 12 are coming from another direction, and 
the native on the bow of No. 10 is hailing tlie helmsman on the ship 
No. 9. The natives in both boats at the right have oars for rud- 
ders. No. 11 is a flock of birds. 

The record reproduced in fig. 115 illustrates another method of giv- 
ing information with regard to distress in another village, which occa- 
sioned the departure of the i)erson by whom the notification wns given. 
The designs were traced upon a narrow strip of wood, which was then

stuck iipou the roof ©f the house belonging to the draftsman, and 
made to lean in the direction of the course to be taken. 

This is shown in Xo. 1, the narrow projection upon the apex of the 
roof denoting the stick; No. 2 is the baidarka, containing the residents 
of the house; 'So. 3 is a grave stick, indicating a death in the settle- 
ment to which the trip is made, the stick being a votive otfering, erected 
to the memory of the deceased; Nos. 4 and 5 denote the houses of the 
village, the triangular one being made by leaning together boards or 
slabs, and is termed a summer house, while the dome-shaped one, made 
more compactly and covered with turf, denotes a permanent or winter 
residence. Both kinds are represented, and by this method of synec-

doche the village is indicated by portraying only one of each kind com- 
posing the settlement. 

The design shown in tig. 11(> is in imitation of drawings made by the 
natives of southern Alaska to convey to the observer the information 
that the draftsman had gone away to another settlement, the inhabi- 
tants of which were in distress. The drawings were made on a strij) 
of w^ood which was placed at the door of the house, where it might be 
seen by visitors or inquirers. 

Yladimir IsTaomoff, the native to whom reference has before been made, 
and who drew for the present writer the specimen under consideration, 
gave the following explanation : Ko. 1 is a native making the gesture

indicating self -with the right hand, and with the left indicating the 
direction of going. No. 2 is the native's habitation, a winter or perma- 
nent residence, dome-shaped, partly underground, with the roof thinly 
covered with turf to keep out the extreme cold. No. 3 is a scaffold used 
for drying fish ; ui^on the top of the pole is placed a piece of wood tied 
so that the longest end points in the direction to be taken by the relief 
party. No. 4 is the baidarka containing t^he party. No. 5, a native of 
the settlement to be visited. No. 6, a summer habitation. No. 7 is a 
shaman or grave stick, a votive offering erected to the memory of a 
recently deceased person, the cause which necessitated the journey. 
No. 8 is a winter habitation, in which the deceased had resided. The 




GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 901 

winter residence, No. 8, together with the summer lodjje in No. 6, denotes 
the seftlrmenf. 

The record ou pUite 40, fig. 3, embracing Nos. 1 to 10, is similar in 
style to one exi^lained by Naomoflf, and pertains to the designation of 
geographic or rather topographic features of an area of country between 
thatoccupiedby the recorder and another 
place to which reference is made. 

No. 1 denotes three birds flying in the 
air, and No. 2 has reference to four seals, 
both groups of creatures being at a shore 
line, as the tree at No. 3 resembling a pine 

■ ^ ^ WALRUS HUNTEK ATTACKKH. 

indicates. The group of trees immedi- 
ately to the right denotes a grove or woods, indicated by a group of 
trees being placed close together. No. 4 is a human being and the inten- 
tion of the recorder is to imply that natives are resident there — beyond 
the woods. Another grove or forest occurs beyond the settlement, as 
indicated by the group of trees at No. 5, beyond which another hamlet 
is situated. 

Then comes another forest at No. 7, beyond which is a locality abound- 
ing in seals, No. 8. Beyond this is a range of timbered hills, the upland 
being indicated by a semicircle covered with short vertical lines to 
denote the timber. 

No. 10 is an ornamental mark similar to No. 18 in imj)ort, and serves 

to denote the end of that particular record. 

^.J»*,j/lj_ A hunting scene begins with No. 11; the 

S \rir whale is moving toward the right, spouting,

elevations at No. 11, over which some birds are 
flying and at the left base of which is another walrus, appear to be 
rocks protruding from the sea. 

At No. 15 are two other walrus, while at Nos. 16 and 17 are two 
approaching whaling ships. 

The character at No. 18 concludes the history. 

COMBAT. 

But few illustrations occur in the ivory records in the National 
Museum collections in which personal combat is portrayed. Wrest- 
ling is shown, in one instance, under the caption of Pastimes and 
(Tames, while another denoting a struggle and combat with a walrus, 
both being in the water, is given below. 

Fig. 117 represents an Alaskan in the water killing a walrus. The 
exploit was deemed of sufiHcient importance to perpetuate it by record- 
ing the illustration upon a slab of ivory, now in the museum of the 
Alaska Commercial Comi)any, San Francisco, California. 

Two men having a serions altercation over a seal are shown in fig. 
118. One is unarmed, while tlie other has a bow and arrow which he

Las tbreatened to use. The unarmed mau's bauds arc in attitudes of 

gesture. 

The two struggling luen, plate 40, fig. 4, No. 1, appear in the attitude 
of ^yrestling, but the rapid approach of two others, No. 2, with spears 
iu the attitude of charging or thrusting, seems to lend more serious- 
ness to the record. The position of the legs of the combatants indicates 
the portrayal of considerable strength being exerted. 

Nos. 3 and <S are houses, the latter showing the column of smoke 
considerably curved downward to the right, denoting a strong breeze 
from tlie opposite direction. No. 4 is a water bird, probably a duck, 
while No. 5 denotes a seal. An animal of this species has been cap- 
tured by the hunter, No. C, who is dragging it home to the house. No. 8, 
while his wife — perhaps some other imnate — stands at the entrance and 
with both hands makes the ixestme o? request or invitation to enter, the 
hands being thrown toward the threshold. Nos. 9, 10, and 11 are dog 
sledges being brought back by traders from some other locality. The 
sleds are loaded. The attitudes assumed by the men in aiding the dogs 
in pulling are very cleverly depicted. Considerable effort is expressed 
in the leader of the sledge at No. 10, while pushing is done by other 
persons at the rear at Nos. 9 and 10. No. 11 is lightly loaded, as the

owner is seated upon the sledge, while his companion is walking leis- 
urely along behind. 

The illustration in fig. 119 represents a village, upon which an attack 
is made by some natives from another locality. 

The figure of a rack — a pole suspended horizontally upon two verti- 
cal forked posts — is shown in No. 1. Fish for drying are seen attached, 
the regularity of the short vertical strokes being evidence of the char- 
acter of the food. Nos. 2 to (>, 7, and 9 are conical huts made of boards 
and saplings, such habitations as are erected by hunting parties when 
they find game sufficient in any special place to prompt their going to 
so much labor for their protection against rain or cold. In Nos. 8, 10, 
11, 12, and 13 alarm is expressed by the signal for assistance, the arms 
being held aloft and waved to attract attention and to indicate that 
the presence of the beholder is desired. 

No. 14 is a tree, from behind which the enemy shot an arrow which 
caused the alarm. The enemy had come up unperceived. 

IDEOGRAPHY. 

This subject embraces one of the most interesting in the entire realm 
of pictography. Among the Eskimo there is less evidence of ability in 
this direction than among aome of our Indian tribes. Gesture signs 




GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 903 

are comuion to all maukind, but in the greater part of the United 
States the sign language is rapidly falling into disuse, both because of 
the destruction of the bulit'alo, tiie pursuit of which was participated 
iu by many tribes of diverse languages, a condition which brought 
about a most highly developed gesture language, and also because of 
the rapid settlement of the country and the consequent restrictions of 
Indians traveling from place to place, which also served to keep alive 
gesture speech. The adoption of the Spanish lan- 
guage by. the Indians on the southwest border, and 
the Chinook jargon in the north, also helped to resume 
the need of a resort to gesture, the i)resent methods 
of oral speech, mutually intelligible, being vastly 
superior and more satisf\ictory. *'»«• i-o.

known, andrej)eated instances showingthe attempted 

reproduction, graphically, of gesture signs occur in the ivory records, 

some examples of which are reproduced. 

To facilitate further study in this line of investigation, the writer 
submits a collection of gesture signs used by the Eskimo and other 
tribes of southern xVlaska, a collection made some years since, though 
hitherto unpublished. 

PICTOGRAPHS OF GESTURE SIGNS. 

N^o. 1 of fig. 120 represents a shaman waving his hands and arms, as 
if he were stirring up the air above his head, the motive being the 
invocation of benign spirits to aid him iu his work. The rested figure 
shown in Ko. 2, denotes the man making application for aid, and his 
arms are extended upward in like manner, but iu this instance denoting 
supplication^ the difference between the two being that the latter is 
rested upon the ground to indicate his asMng for aid, whereas the 
shaman is portrayed not only erect, but in the attitude of 
dancing, Avith his song and incantations. 

The illustration given in fig. 121 is taken from an ivory 
drill bow in the National Museum, marked as from Xortou 
Fig. 121. Sound, Alaska. The figure represents the gesture sign, or

Fig. 122 represents a number of natives fishing through the.ice.for

of the water, a hole having been cut for breathing i)lace at which these 
animals make their appearance. No. 2 has a seal upon the ice and 
appears to have great difticulty in i)ulling it along. No, 3 is preparing 
to spear an animal, his watchful attitude being apparent. No. 4 is 
holding aloft his harpoon or lance, making a signal that he has discov- 
ered game, or hears it, and thereby warns others near by to be silent.

surface to breathe. The signal is graphically portrayed in the follow- 
ing illustration, in which several hunters had such exploits, and also 
in many others, in some of which, however, the signal may also denote 
the idea to come, a call for assis.tance when the animal is thought to be 
liable to escape or to be unmanageable.

Help to secure the monsters is required, and all of the occupants of the 
boats are making the signal for assistance by holding horizontally 
above the head the boat paddle. This signifies come, and also, under 
other circumstances, game found.

elevated, to signify two nights or sleeps; No. 8, the speaker with his 
harpoon, the weajiou with Avhich he sometimes hunted, and with the 
left making the gesture sign to denote sea lion. The hand is held edge- 
wise, with the thumb elevated, then pushed outward from the body in 
a slightly downward curve. No. 9 represents a sea lion, which the 
hunter, No. 10, secured by shooting with bow and arrow. No. 11 is the

boat with two persons in it, the paddles projecting downward beneath 
it. No. 12 is the winter habitation of the speaker. 

The record given in tig. 125 was also drawn for the present writer by 
Yladimir Naomoff. 

Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 represent the person spoken to, and no arms are 
indicated, as no response is supposed to be made by him. No. 2 indi- 
cates the speaker with his right hand to his side or breast, indicat- 
ing self, the left hand pointing in the direction in which he is going.

extended, signifying many. When the hands are thus held up, in sign 
language, it signifies ten, but when they are brought toward and back- 
ward from one another, many. Among the " Plains Indians" of Indian 
Territory, when both hands are thus held up for ten, and then thrown 
downward to the left, it signifies ten times ten or one hundred. The

latter practice of indicating any number multiplied by ten, by thus 
throwing to the left both hands, has not been found to obtain among 
the Alaskan natives. No. 0, the right hand is placed to the side of 
the head to denote sleep or night; in this instance denoting many sleeps, 
or, in other words, many nights and days; the left hand points down-

attachment is erected, again leaning in the direction to be taken. These 
sticks are placed at proper intervals until the village is sighted, the left 
hand semicircular or dome-shaped body denoting the settlement shown 
by synecdoche. 

The drawing shown in fig. 127^ was also made by Naomoft" for the 
present writer, to illustrate that a settlement had been attacked by a 
hostile party and finally deserted. The last one to leave prepares the 
drawing upon a strip of wood to inform his friends of the resort of the 
survivors. No. 1 represents three hills or ranges, signifying that 
the course taken would carry them beyond that number of hills; No. 2, 
the draftsman, indicating the direction, with the left hand pointing 
to the ground, one hill, and the right hand indicating the number tico, 
the number still to be crossed; No. 3, a circular piece of wood or 
leather, with the representation of a face, placed upon a pole and facing 
the direction to be taken from the settlement. In this instance the 
drawing of the character denotes a hostile attack upon the village, for 
which misfortune such devices are sometimes erected. Nos. 4 and 5 
indicate summer and winter habitations. No. 6 is a storehouse erected 
upon upright poles so as to be beyond the reach of predatory animals. 
The latter device is used by the coast natives generally.

Fig. 128 represents hunters who have been unfortunate and are 
sufiteriiig" from hunger. The figures are scratched or drawn upon a 
piece of wood, and placed where there is tlie greatest chance of its dis- 
covery by passers. The stick bearing tlie devices is stuck in the 
ground and inclined to- 
ward the shelter of the 
suflerers. The folio win g 
is the interpretation of 
the record: 

iSTo. 1 is a horizontal 
line, and denotes a-canoe, 

indicating that the persons are fishermen; No. 2, a man with both arms 
extended, signifying in gesture language nothing^ corresponding to the 
ordinary gesture for negation ; Ko. 3 is a companion with the right hand 
placed to the mouth, signifying to cat, the left pointing to the house 
occupied by the hunters, and indicating at that idace there is nothing 
to eat; No. 4 represents the shelter occupied by the sufferers.

sents a man making the gesture for nothing, both hands thrown hori- 
zontally outward toward either side. No. 3 has his right hand placed 
to the mouth to denote to eat, the left jiointing to the habitation, No. 4, 
indicating that there is nothing to eat in that house.

HUNTING SCENE. 

This is used by the Alaskan coast natives generally. 

The record portrayed in fig. 130, refers to the success of the hunter 
shown in No. 3. As elsewhere stated with reference to the position or 
attitude of animals, it will be perceived that the two deer, represented 
in Nos. 1 and 2, were secured by shooting, the gun being indicated in 
No. 3. No. 4 represents a man with a gun held transversely above the 
head, this being a signal to denote come, or apin-oach, while the indi- 
viduals in Nos. 5, G, and 7 are in various attitudes with extended arms 



()08 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Lands, and lingers. No. 5 is represented in the act of making a gesture 
synonymous witli that in No. 4, attracting attention and beckoning to 
another to approach. 

No. G likewise shows the gestures to come or approach, the direction 
of tiio hands being earthward, corresponding exactly with a common 
and widespread gesture for the person called to approach steaHhiUj. 
Indications by gesture to come are uniformly, amongst the North 
American Indians and Innuit, made by turning the palm downward 
and drawing the extended index finger toward the body, as if directly 
indicating the path npon which the person beckoned to is directed to 
approach. 

In No. 7 the gesture appears still more excited, and the skill in 
pictorial expression is certainly very cleverly indicated. The right 
hand of the figure calls to the beholder to come, while with the left 
hand, as with the right, the number four is indicated, as is also the 
case with the figure in No. 0. The reason of this is apparent in Nos. 
8, 9, 10, and 11, denoting four black or perhaps cinnamon bears, whose 
heads are directed away from the group of human figures, aiul espe- 
cially so from No. 3, who thns intimates that he was informed by his

friends of four bears having been seen in a direction pointed to by the 
left hand of No. 7, but which he did not secnre. 

Had the heads been directed toward the speaker or owner of the 
record, as in the instance of the two deer, the information would have 
signified that the bears had been captnred. 

An interesting and rarely found engraving is reproduced herewith 
in fig. 131. Specimens of like import were described to the present 
wiiter, and pencil drawings made to illustrate the manner in which the 
Aigaluvamnt Eskimo of the southern shores of Alaska convey the 
intelligence that they want assistance and that they possess nothing. 

The figures shown in Nos. 1 and 4 represent the habitations of two 
families, the storehouse. No. 2, being common property. Nos. 3, 5, 6, 7, 
and the human figure standing upon the habitation marked No. 4 are 
making signals, all excepting No. 7, calling attention by their uplifted 
hands and arms, while No. 7 has his afms extended, to denote nothhuj, 
this being a universal gesture for that idea. The Egyptian hieroglyphs 
and the Maya pictograph, as mentioned by De Landa in his represen- 
tation of alphabetic characters, are drawn in the attitude of out- 
stretched arms, no other part of the body being present or necessary. 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 909 

Tho, conventional gesture sign used by the Indians of the United 
States is to throw the flat right hand outward to the right, the hand in 
the tirst position being in front of the right side at the height of the 
elbow. 

Some tribes and European nations who are still profuse and prolific 
in gesture as an accompaniment to speech frequently employ both 
hands, moving them outward from the front toward either side, bring- 
ing the palms uppermost, and at the same time giving the shoulders a 
slight shrug, an unconscious though effective emphasis to the gesture. 

The accompanying figure (1312) represents at ISTos. 2,3, and 4 the hab- 
itations of a village of which the author or owner of the record is a 
uiember. ^o. 1 denotes a water fowl. No. 2 is a habitation, from the 
roof of which project three shaman sticks, erected as votive offerings 
to deceased members of the household. The owner is also apparent on 
the roof, occupied by domestic duties. No. 3 is another house, from the 
roof of which is seen the issuings of smoke. No. 4 is another long 
house, from the right hand end of which is seen i^rojecting a stick indi- 
cating the direction taken by the owner in his departure for another 
locality. No. 5 represents a swan (the uppermost tigure), which Avas 
observed by the traveler on his journey, as also an animal, the specific 
name of which could not be ascertained. No. 0, however, is the traveler

himself seated on his dog sledge, holding in his hand a whip, with which 
he is urging the dog to hasten, as the end of the journey is near at 
hand. He is preceded by another native (No. 7), whom he caught up 
with, who was dragging home some game. No. 8 is the house of the 
person whom tho traveler is going to visit. The left-hand figure sees 
him coming, and shows his pleasure by extending his arm horizontally, 
to inform others of the village that he sees the stranger approaching. 
The figure on the meat pole is said to be exceedingly pleased at the 
news, and is seen performing some athletic feat on the horizontal pole^ 
mentioned. Another of the household is occupied at the storehouse 
(No. 9) in preparing for the storing of the game captured by No. 7. 

Smoke observed issuing from the roof of the habitation No. 8 is 
similar to that in No. 3, and resembles also in graphic execution the 
tail of the dog in No. 6. Upon comparison it will be found that the 
water thrown up by a whale in blowing is represented in like manner. 

ABSTRACT IDEAS. 

But few instances denoting, or perhaps even suggesting, abstra 
ideas have been met with. The following examples embrace also ges- 
ture language as well as an attempt at recording subjective ideas. 



910 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

It is seldom that the indication of speech is attempted by tlie Eskimo, 
but in iig. 133 an excellent portrayal of the idea of urging by means 
of the voice, or calling, is given. The two men are traveling with a 
sledge and three dogs, the foremost of the figures having a line extend- 
ing from the side of the head— presumably the mouth— to thele ader 
of the dogs. The idea is also exhibited in other pictographs made by 

Eskimo, and is not of rare

Voice lines are frequently 
and similarly portrayed by the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Dakota Indians. 
In pictographs relating to hunting expeditions and pastimes the lirst- 
named tribe is perhaps one of the most advanced in expressing pic- 
torially some of the juore difficult ideas, not only objective ones but 
subjective as well. 

The line extending from the mouth to denote speech is a visible pre- 
sentation of the common gesture sign for the same idea, made by 
passing forward from the mouth the extended index linger.

The elevated left hand of the leader of the party is an additional 
indication that he is urging the dogs to (juicken their pace, or perhaps 
to exert greater effort in pulling the sledge. 

The illustration in tig. 134 represents several men carrying an 
umiak. The vessel at No. 3 is raised above the ground, the four lines 
resembling props or supports being the men's legs. The boat is being- 
carried toward the water, the shore lines being indicated by the vertical 
curves at ^STo. 2. The artist felt that he had not the skill in perspec- 
tively showing the water's edge, and so 
X)laces the water lines in a position in 
w^hich they may clearly be observed.

at No. i denote a standing one in conversation and gesture with the 

departing ones, and another seated upon the ground. 

A good portrayal of the whale is given in fig. 135. The spray — a small 
character for which is placed over the highest ridge of the head — is 
portrayed to specify the nature of the mammal. The oblique line pro- 
truding from the back is the harpoon which was used in the capture. 

An interesting fact connected with this pictograph is the represeuta- 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 911 

tion of death, i. e., a dead whale or killed whale, determined by the 
presence of the instrument with which death was accomplished. This 
is rare in Innuit pictography, but frequent in Indian art. 

Plate 68, fig. 3, is a large bag handle from Cape Nome. This is par- 
ticularly interesting from the fact of the presence of a variety of 
human forms, some resembling the bird-like forms or wings very much 
resembling the characters for " Thunderbird," as portrayed by the 
OJibwa and other Algonkian tribes. The left half of the lower face of 
the bow represents umiaks with hunters and harpoons. Near the 
middle of the record is a very gracefully drawn whale tail up in the 
air, as the animal appears to be diving while tbe hunter is throwing 
his harpoon into its body. Upon tlie upper half of this same side of 
the bow, the two sides being divided by parallel median lines, are a 
number of whale tails, indicating whales that have escaped, while 
others are shown in the attitude of swimming. Near tlie left is a very 
conspicuous umiak occupied by four hunters. Over the bow of the 
boat projects a large harpoon resting upon the harpoon rest. This 
illustration is reproduced elsewhere with further explanation. The 
upper or convex side of the bow is also divided into two longitudinal 
ridges or faces. Upon one of these is the portrayal of umiaks rowing 
toward the left, one hunter harpooning an animal, while at the extreme 
left four hunters appear to be carrying an umiak toward the water, as 
if preparing for departure. The right half of the record appears to 
represent the other line, as there are several habitations with smoke 
rising from the smoke holes, votive offerings attached near by, as well 
as scaffolds. In this instance the latter are evidently for burial pur- 
poses and not for food. This is made clear from the fact that the 
votive offerings are placed in close contact with the respective burials. 
A little farther to the right are three men returning with a sledge and 
a single dog, two additional persons appearing to lag behind, as if 
wearied or bent with age. The representation of a human figure car- 
rying a staff" is a common indication of age or indigence, and occurs 
very frequently in Egyptian hieroglyphs, as well as in the mnemonic. 
One of the individuals shown in the Eskimo record stoops forward 
very much, and this is believed to indicate age. Immediately behind 
him is the rude outline of a fox, which may have reference to his being 
a shaman, or he may possibly have captured such an animal. To the 
right is a figure denoting a whale's fluke, indicating that the hunters 
are also whalers, because to the right of this fluke is an umiak with 
two persons sitting in it using the paddle. The hunter in the bow of 
this boat has his paddle projecting forward and not quite touching the 
water, the persj^ective being admirably represented, as it does not cut 
through and destroy the structure of the boat. Upon the other face of 
this same bow are several umiaks in i)ursuit of a whale and several 
natives dragging seals, two of these natives having attached to the rear 
part of their bodies appendages drawn exactly like a dog's tail or a fox's 



9J2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

tail, wliicli indicates that the natives belonged to those classes referred 
to by Captain Beechey in his IN'otice of the Indians of Schisma Reef 
Inlet, who wore such ornaments attached to their clothing, giving them 
a ridiculous appearance, and may probably have occasioned the report 
of the Ohnkche that the people of that region have tails like dogs. 

The remaining figures upon this bow consists of human beings and a 
few animal forms, near the extreme right being a curious outline of an 
umiak, the occupants of which are shown with extended arms from 
which numerous short lines project. These may denote the fur upon 
the sleeves of the dress, or they may have other signification, or they 
may possibly be merely a fancy of the engraver. 

SHAMANISM. 

Although the Eskimo are extremely superstitious, and numbers of 
them are recognized shamans of ability, yet there seems to be a gen- 
eral scarcity of pictographic matter pertaining thereto. This is strange, 
too, as auiong some peoples the records are almost entirely devoted to 
shamanistic ceremonies, and in several instances, as among theOjibwa, 
for instance, the mnemonic and hunting records — all shamanistic — are 
the only relics of pictography at this day. 

MYTHIC ANIMALS. 

But a few specimens portraying mythic animals occur, the following 
being the most conspicuous: 

The accompanying specimen, on plate 72, is from Cape Prince of 
Wales, and was collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson. It represents a whale- 
line guide, and is used on the bow of an umiak used for whale hunt- 
ing. The two pieces of ivory, measuring in height 4^ inches, are 
ingeniously joined together by mortising, the slot in either piece being 
made so as to face its fellow; and into these slots is afterwards placed 
a piece to hold both sides in place, by being secured by ivory pegs 
which pass through at right angles to the connecting i)iece, as will be 
observed in the illustrations. In the lower cut will be noticed an addi- 
tional piece, larger than the round pegs, whicli consists of a large 
glass bead. 

The horns of the specimen represent the heads of a mammal, the 
eyes consisting of wooden pegs, while the nostrils are drillings filled 
in with pegs which appear to have been blackened. 

In the upper figure are portrayed two thunderbirds or eagles, each 
descending to grasp a whale, the latter having spray in the act of 
being ejected from the ''blowholes." In the lower figure the birds are 
represented as having secured the whales and have risen into the air, 
as seems indicated by the form of the whale on the right-hand side. 
The engraving of the characters is decidedly bold and exi)ressive, the 
entire surface of the etched portions still retaining more or less black 
color. The general artistic form of the bird is very like that usually

found in Algonkian pictograpLs, and does not keep in general har-

Alaskan examples, seems at once to repel the suspicion of intrusive

MYTHIC SERPENTS. 

The four perforations in the piece are for attaching- it to the gunwale 
of the umiak. 

The illustrations given, a, h, and c, of fig. 13G, represent mythic 
serpents, and are described in some of the folk tales, c very much 
resembles the *' water monster" of the Ojibwa, 
though it is scarcely possible that the cult of 
the latter could have been conveyed, even in 
the slightest degree, to the Eskimo. Other

Athabascas family, have serpent myths, and rig. 137. 

from this people the idea may have been con- '«^thic animal devouring na- 
veyed to the lunuit, especially as the latter 

are in frequent communication with the Kenai Indians, the northwest- 
ernmost tribe of the above-mentioned famiy. 

It has been suggested, too, that the creatures may have been copied 
from or suggested by illustrations in newspapers or other literature. 

In fig. 137 is shown a mythic creature taking up a man and preparing 

to devour him. The belief in water monsters survives among the 

natives of the southern coast, opposite the island of Kadiak, a creature 

resembling somewhat a reptilian form in imitation of 

an alligator, of which illustrations are also given else-

sacred character, and has reference to ceremonials known only to the

Ill plate 66, iig. 2, is the engraved figure of a seal, within whicli are 
various objects, animate and inanimate, resembles that class of sacred 
objects often carried by the Ojibwa jes'sakid or juggler. 

Fig. 130 represents a series of characters only part of which are 
intelligible. No. 1 is evidently— from the curve of the horns— a rein- 
deer while No. 2 is explained to be a mythic animal— a serpent, as 
similarly elongated (juadrupeds have been interpreted by some natives. 
No. 3 appears to be the first of a series of seven figures (Nos. 3, 4, 5, 
7, 8, 9, 10) which are apparently decorated with fringed coats, like the 
neighboring Kolosh and Kenai Indians, and marks of bird or other 
faces upon their heads. 

No. is an aquatic bird in flight, which at.once shows the difference 
in execution of ideas, the human figure being bifurcated as above indi- 
cated. No. 11 is a mammal, resembling the usual character denoting 
the j>M^on'<?(t'. 

CEREMONIALS. 

Mr. Murdoch remarks that at some of the ceremonial dances of the 
Eskimo, at Point Barrow, the participants wear masks, some of which 
are sometimes decorated with slight ornamentation. 

Fig. 139. 

MYTHIC CREATURES. 

Gorgets are also worn, and fig. 3 represents an excellent example 
with ornamentations relating to fishing and hunting. The same author 
remarks, also, that the more southern Eskimo of Alaska are in the 
habit of using in their dances very elaborate and highly ornamented 
and painted masks, of which the National Museum possesses a very 
large collection. The ancient Aleuts also used masks. On the other 
hand, no other Eskimo, save ''those of Alaska, ever use masks in their 
performances, as far as I can learn, with the solitary exception of the 
people of Baffin Land, where a mask of the hide of the bearded seal is 
worn on certain occasions. Nordenskiold saw one wooden mask among 
the people near the winter quarters of the Vega, but learned that this 
had been brought from Bering Strait, and probably from America."' 

The dancing mask previously referred to and shown in plate 10 is 
from Kuskoquim, and was collected by Mr. E. W, Nelson. The speci- 
men is of interest from the fact that it constitutes perhaps the only 
example of woodwork bearing pictographs in color. The specimen, 
including the lower pendant, measures about IH inches in length, the 
width of the largest piece— bearing the eyes, nose, and mouth— being 
almost 3 inches across. Upon the top and right side are a number of 
punctures for the insertion of feathers, only three of the latter being 
now present. The four slats of wood are attached to the main piece

by meaus of thin stL-ands of bark. The several pieces were rudely 
besmeared with a white chalky paint, while over several portions of 
them are markings in black. 

Upon the left cheek of the mask are four vertically arranged tigures 
of masks, rather grotesque in expression. The lower one is not as 
elaborately drawn as the others. Upon the ui)per piece of wood, iipou 
the left of the mask, is an outline of an umiak, with sail spread. In 
the bow of the boat is the figure of a native with hands and arms 
uplifted, while another figure is visible in the stem acting as helmsman. 

The markings upcm the remaining piece are i)robably meaningless. 

Among the Indians of the Northwest Coast, the lakutat and Tshilkat, 
and to a certain extent the neighboring tribes, masked dances are of 
frequent occurrence, the purport being usually ceremonial; though at 
this day much of the former sacredness of these ceremonials has become 
debased. Among the Eskimo ceremonial dances are of great impor- 
tance, though not of such frequence as among their vsouthern neighbors. 

In fig. 140 the vertical strokes shown by Nos. 1 and 10 represent the 
timbers supporting the structure within which the dance takes place, 
not sufQcient space being available upon the specimen of ivory to rep-

resent the roof. Nos. 2, 7, and 9 are the drummers, each armed with a 
flat, tambourine drum, generally used by the shamen everywhere. Nos. 
3, 4, 5, G, and 8 rei^resent the dancers, marked with what appears to be 
bear heads — made of some light wood, such as cedar. The attitudes of 
the dancers are remarkably clever and lifelike, showing the various 
attitudes, both natural and assumed, in imitation of the animal rejire- 
sented, as may be found at any dance of aboriginal peoi)les when they 
attain that particular degree of enthusiasm consequent upon and per- 
ceptible to the beholder after a feast. 

This engraving, ])\ate 73, fig. 2, is one of the most interesting on 
account of the portrayal of the transmission of sound, a stage of devel- 
opment found in but few instances in Alaskan pictographs, but of 
frequeutoccurrence among the Cheyennes,and other neighboring tribes, 
in the vicinity of Fort Sill, Indian Territory, and other posts farther

The entire record relates to a ceremonial dance, held on account of a 
sick person, and the indication of the village houses and sledges of 
visiting natives. 

The narrator is indicated at ISTo. 1, his arras outstretched to embrace 
the surrounding area as the place where he was, and which, perhaps,

is liis residence also. l^os. 2, 6, and 8 denote scaftblds for food, the 
accumulated material being apparent upon the transverse poles. At the 
residence at ISTo. 3 smoke is emerging from the smoke hole in the roof, 
and someone is also upon the roof of the entrance reaching outward 
toward what may have been intended for a scaffold, but which, because 
of erosion, had become partly obliterated, as have also portions of the 
human beings beneath. The next house, No. 4, also has a column of 
smoke rising from the smoke hole, while several vertical lines before 
the entrance indicate the original portrayal of the necessary storehouse 
or food scaffold. No. 5 is another permanent habitation, while at No. 
7, over the roof of the entrancetto the house, is the outline of a man, hor- 
izontal and with the hand thrown downward as if making a common 
gesture sign for lying doivn, or to lie there, having reference perhaps to 
the recumbent position of the occupant, who may be sick and for whose 
benefit the ceremonies are in operation. A heavy column of smoke is 
issuing from the chimney. 

Upon the house No. are .two persons apparently interested in 
something or someone at No. 7, no doubt referring to the sick man. 
At No. 10 is designated the entrance to the house No. 9, and upon the 
roof are four persons; the one at the right holding in one hand tam- 
bourine drum, while with the other hand he is beating it, the sound 
therefrom passing forward over the group of dancers before the house. 
In the rear of the drummer are three assistant musicians, and from the 
absence of drums or rattles they appear to be singers, the belief being 
furthermore strengthened from the fact that each of tlie three has an 
arm or hand elevated; the one at the right appearing to place his 
hand before his mouth to denote in gesture language speech, voice, 
song, a common portrayal in various Indian pictographs, as well as 
Maya, Mexican, Egyptian, and Ilittite hieroglyphs and objective repre- 
sentations of voice in various forms. The remaining figures also appear 
to have their hands directed upward before the face, an approach in 
gesture to the preceding. The sign for sing, singing, is made by hold- 
ing the palm upward and passing the hand ui)ward and forward from 
the month, though beginning before the neck and passing at from 6 to 
10 inches before the mouth. 

The narrow vertical line with streamers of cloth or calico attached, 
and surmounted by the wooden efQgy of a bird, is a votive offering or 
"shaman stick" erected upon the roof of the house No. 9 in commenjo- 
ration of one of the household. 

The character at No. 12 is another shaman, armed with a drum, which 
he holds in one hand and with the other strikes the head with a drum- 
stick, which is seen crossing the surface in the endeavor to drive away 
one of the evil spirits or demons hovering about in the air after being 
expelled by exorcism from the body of the sick man. 

The group embracing nine figures. No. 13, denotes the assistant 
shamans driving about and punishing the evil spirits— the same one

being liore reproduced with uplifted liands and once as a small being — 
tliey being masked and decorated with fringed sleeves and garments 
and armed with weapons possessing mysterious power in exorcism. 
The demon appears in nearly each instance to supplicate the shaman 
not to strike with the uplifted rod, the gesture sign for supplication 
being accurately portrayed, both hands being elevated toward the one 
addressed, not only surpassing in pictorial execution the same idea as 
found among other American aborigines, but being exactly similar to 
the hieroglyph, for the same idea, of the Egyptians. 

Nos. 14, 15, and 10 are sledges, drawn up near to the place of the 
dance. The representations of the sledges arc more nearly like some 
figures of the baidarka shown elsewhere, because of the almost vertical 
bow and the dark line along the top, consisting of two horizontal lines 
within which are short vertical strokes, the latter denoting bales of 
peltries and furs received from other natives for barter. The man at 
the fore part of the sledge in No. 14 is smoking a pipe, while the figures 
on top of both No. 14 and 15 appear to en^joy the scene, their arms 
apparently raised as if in acclamation. At No. 10 the dog is assisted 
in pulling the sledge by the man, who is dragging at a cord, the load 
being evidoitly a heavy one, as the man at the side of the sledge is 
also tugging at it to assist in propulsion. 

The scene presented in plate 73, fig. 1, is of interest, because the 
ceremonial dance is performed in the middle of the village, as indicated 
by the peculiar distribution of the habitations and the sledges of the 
visitors. 

The characters in Nos. 1, 2, and 3 denote permanent or winter habi- 
tations, upon which are observed some of the witnesses to the dance. 
No. 4 is a high pole erected between the habitations, and upon it is an 
Gffigy of an animal, while the pole itself is decorated with streamers of 
calico or cloth, tiannel, etc. No. 5 is a slender stick, upon the top of 
which is placed the wooden effigy of a bird, the whole being designated 
{I '• shaman stick" or votive offering, being a token or memorial erected 
by a relative or friend to one deceased. The memorial is intended also 
as a 'Muck stick," i. e., a public testimonial of wishing luck to the 
spirit of the dead. 

Near the habitation No. 2 is an oblong figure upon stilts, denoting a 
scaffold upon which food is stored. These are so erected as to be 
beyond the reach of dogs and noxious or jiredatory animals. 

Nos. to 12 are sledges belonging to a party of fur traders who 
chanced to stop at the village. At Nos. C and 12 the dogs have 
already been unhitched and the owners are seated at the front, smok- 
ing their pipes. Bales of goods are indicated by the solid outline of 
oblong figures raised upon short lines above the sledges themselves. 

The human figures represented by Nos. 13 to 22 are the shaman 
and his assistants. These are duplicate characters of the latter por- 
trayed in driving away evil spirits, Nos. 25 to 2i3, which are indicated 



918 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

as liuinan forms, curved, with tlie feet and legs turned upward and the 
arms thrown forward, as if making violent efforts at jumping. These 
spirits are driven around from one point to another, some shamans 
driving and striking them to compel their departure, while others are 
assisting in exorcism by using the magic rattles, seen as short T-shaped 
figures in the hands of some of the assistants. 

All of this ceremony is for the purpose of exorcism, the expulsion of the 
demons of disease from the body of a sick man, indicated as wrapped 
up at ^o. 24, where he is supposed to be lying upon the ground. 

The entire grouping of the figures is, necessarily,, placed along two 
base lines, each line running parallel with the border of the ivory bow 
upon which the record is portrayed. The heads of the different indi- 
viduals, as well as the housetops and the tops of the sledges, are all 
directed inward toward the middle, this being the limit of possibility 
of artistic execution in attempting a bird's eye view of the whole vil- 
lage and its dancing ground — the latter being about the high decorated 
pole, at jS"o. 4, but for lack of space the ceremonial is transferred to 
where it is drawn — the intention being to represent the dancers as if 
in a circle, their movements being directed around the pole bearing the 
animal figure.

Fig. 141. 
SHAMANISTIC CEEEMONIAL. 



Two distinct styles of engraving occur in the pictograph represented 
in fig. 141, although they are probably by the same artist. The habi- 
tations shown in Xos. 1 and 3 are in delicately engraved lines quite 
foreign in execution to the crudely carved figures in Nos. 4 to 11. The 
houses are in profile, and both indicate the place of entrance at the 
right side, beneath the delicate vertical rod projecting above. Human 
figures are seen upon the roofs, those upon No. 3 appearing to be occu- 
pied in an animated conversation, as suggested by tlw, attitude of the 
arms. 

The vertical poles, connected by a crosspiece, indicated in No. 2, rep- 
resent a rack where fish and the meat of game are suspended for dry- 
ing. The figure of a man engaged in some occupation connected with 
the rack is observed between the vertical poles. 

The human figures indicated in Nos. 4 to 1) are engaged in a dance, 
the attitudes of all buttv^^o being well executed in the representation of 
the peculiar manner of leaning forward the body, common to nearly all 
aboriginal tribes when participating in such pastimes. In Nos. G and 
8 are seen peculiar (ail-like appendages, representing merely ornamental 
streamers often tied to the belt at the spiral portion to represent the 
tails of animals which these natives sometimes imitate, both in dress 
and actions. 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 919 

The two mammalian figures at the extreme right — Nos. 10 and 11 — 
are clogs, facing one another, an attitude assumed by strangers, as 
these had probably accompanied their masters to the jdace of the 
ceremony portrayed. 

Plate 73, fig. 4 represents a ceremonial dance. The characters in 
Nos. 1 and 4, representing three pairs of human forms, are dancers, 
who are aiding the shaman at Ko. 2, who is shown with his hands 
uplifted and throwing them circularly about as if "stirring up a 
breeze," which he is in fact doing, in so far as it pertains to the spirits 
of the air, whose aid he is invoking. All this is being done because 
the seated figure at the left end of the habitation, I^To. 3, is requesting 
the shaman's assistance. Four other human figures are indicated about 
the same habitation, though partly worn off, and at the right-hand 
upper corner is a shaman stick or votive offering, placed there to the 
memory of one of the owner's family. The stick appears to be sur- 
mounted by an eflSgy of a bird, this being the common practice. Nos. 
5 and appear to be dancers, each armed with rattles, small round 
frames of wood, having both flat sides covered with seal gut or buck- 
skin, being used by shamen or their assistants. No. 7 denotes another 
habitation, "at the left end of which is a votive offering and at the 
other a human figure, who, with his left hand, reaches down to another, 
No. 8, who appears in the act of winking aid from spirits in the air. 

No. 9 is undetermined, but Nos. 10, 11, and 12 are reindeer, the first 
and last having attached to them the spirit or guardian of the shaman, 
who has comiielled the animals to come within reach of the hunter's 
gun, though only one of the three. No. 12, having been secured. 

No. 13 represents the shaman in another instance when his services 
were requested; this time by a native shown in No. 14, at the left-hand 
end and seated or leaning against the dwelling. Some votive offerings 
are also perceived upon the roof, while to the right. No. 15, are a num- 
ber of natives indulging in a dance, x)robably a ceremonial one, as the 
record is one pertaining to shamanistic matters entirely. 

The ivory bag handle shown on plate 32, fig. 7, is an excellent piece 
of workmanship, and i)resents evidence of artistic expression not met 
with in any other specimens. 

The central disk presents the relief carving of a human face, the nose 
being clearly indicated as different from that drawn or engraved ui)on 
the seal's face, w^hile below the mouth are the vertical lines to denote 
the tattooing practiced by the women. The expression of the face is 
rather firm and represents a frown. The ring surrounding the face 
is the far hood, the fur itself being indicated by the short radiating 
lines extending therefrou). 

The opposite side of the specimen is a reproduction of the obverse, 
with the exception, however, that the face is that of a man, the mouth 
being portrayed by having the corners turned upward to denote a 
smile, while below either corner is a circular spot to indicate the 
labrets. The furred hood is also show^n.

KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



Upon eitlier side of the face are seals, ornameuted with rayed cir- 
cles, while aloug the lower edge are two parallel lines bearing interior 
decorations of simple cross lines. 

The upper edge has a simple longitudinal crease, while beneath this 
line is furthermore oriuimented by short lateral ones. 

INDIVIDUAL SHAMANISM. 

The illustration presented in fig. 142 is perhaps unique, the original 
having been obtained from a native well versed in shamanism, and in 
fact professed to be one. 

Descriptions of shamans' ceremonials in medicine lodges, especially 
in the initiation of candidates, were published by the present writer in 
the Seventh Annual Keport of the Bureau of Ethnology, and relate 

to the Ojibwa Mide'wiwin or 
Grand Medicine Society, a cult 
society known to the Catholic 
Fathers who first came to Can- 
ada, but which, until the above 
r*eport was published, had 
never been thoroughly under- 
stood. The complete exposi- 
tion of the mythology and 
ritual thereto was given by the 
•present writer; and a similar 
contribution to science has 
been recently published in the 
Fourteenth Annual Report of 
the same IJureau, and embraces 
the exi)osition of the ceremoni- 
als of the several cult societies 
of the Menomini Indians, the 
report being a i)art only of the 
memoir which embraces a com- 
plete history of that tribe, first 
known through their discovery 
by Nicollet, in 1034. 
The illustration given above, representing an Eskimo shaman heal- 
ing a sick man, with the explanation given by the recorder thereof, is 
of peculiar value and interest. The Innuit ceremonial structures are 
partly underground, the roof being covered with turf and other 
materials, and the entrance thereto being by a partly underground or 
possibly tunnel-like passage- way. 

In the figure, a represents the entrance to the chamber, or lodge, as 
a habitation of natives or Indians is often designated'; />, the fireplace; 
C-, a vertical ])iece of wood upon which is placed a cross piece, upon 
each end of which is a lamp made of steatite and fed with fat; d, the

at the entrance to strike and hasten the departure of the demon. 

Plate 64, fig. 1, represents a drill bow from the north of Korton Sound. 
Contrary to the usual custom, this specimen is curved edgewise, so that 
upon the back appears one continuous record, while upon the front side 
there are two, the front being beveled from the central line. Quite a 
number of interesting figures appear upon this record, the results in 
bunting having apparently been brought about by the kind offices of 
a sbaman, to whom application has been made for success by the 
recorder or owner. In the small space at tbe extreme left is tlie outline 
of a human figure, the arms bent and the hands touching the sides, 
two prominent ears, and three lines directed upward from the head. 
This represents the shaman whose inliuence bad been obtained. Imme- 
diately below this human tigure is an oblong outline attached to a 
delicate groove or line extending forward to a whale. This represents 
the float attached to the harpoon line. The next character represents 
a seal facing the right, its vis-a-vis being a native crawling along with a 
spear in his hand, evidently intending to capture it. The sliort etchings 
projecting from the base line and extending to the right to a distance of 
about three inches, represent a marsh. Five seals are shown about the 
middle of this marsh, as if swimming in the water with only the head 
and top of the body projecting. Beyond these animals, and at the end 
of the marsh, is the outline of a boat. Some distance to tbe right is a 
figure very much resembling a crouching bear. This again is a repro- 
duction of the figure of the shaman whose kindly offices had been 
secured upon another occasion. He seems to be throwing forward a 
magic bullet which, used by the hunter in the kaiak above him, enabled 
the hunter to secure the seal he wanted, as shown by the bullet nmrk 
above the animal a short distance in front of the kaiak. U])on the 
same face«of the bow will be observed a number of characters as if 
suspended from the upper line thereof I5y turning the bow about, the

pictures will be brouglit into proper position. Beginning at tbe left, 
are two elongated figures, eacli upon stilts, wbicli represent tbe scaf- 
folds upon wbicb tbese boats are placed for drying. Tbree winter babi- 
tations are next in order, about wbicb are a number of liuman beings 
in various attitudes. Smoke issues from tbe top of tbe bouse, and tbe 
vertical rods projecting from tbe first and second indicate votive offer- 
ings. To tbe rigbt of tbe tbird bouse are tbree buman beings standing 
about an umiak, wbicb is drawn foresbortened, and a line extending to 
tbe rigbt to an oblong figure, wbicb is a seal wbicb tbey bave captured. 
Tbere are outlines of five natives witb arms extended, one witb a spear, 
but tbe import of tbese cbaractcrs is not intelligible. Tbe next figure, 
bowever, is sbown in tbe act of dragging a seal, wbile beyond it is 
anotber seal, toward wbicb a native is throwing bis spear. Beyond 
tbe latter is sbown tbe body of anotber seal, toward wbicb a bunter is 
crawling on all fours, and in an opposite direction from bim is bis com- 
panion engaged in like pursuit of anotber seal, sbown to tbe rigbt. As 
tbe bow is sbown in tbe illustration, witb tbe figure of a sbaman at tbe 
rigbt, it will be observed tbat along tbe upper face are a number of 
illustrations wbicb represent various avocations. At tbe extreme rigbt 
is tbe body of a reindeer lying upon tbe ground, tbe borns at tbe rigbt 
projecting upward, and upon tbe body of the animal, as well as bebind 
it, are birds feeding upon it. Following tbis toward tbe rigbt are four 
otber animals of like species, witb tbe outlines of a fifth, wbicb can not 
be clearly determined. Following tbe base line for some distance, we 
come to anotber deer in tbe act of browsing. A little beyond tbe 
middle, toward tbe rigbt, are tbree natives, tbe first going toward tbe 
rigbt witb bis barpoon directed forward, tbe second witb a line extend- 
ing to tbe rigbt to some object upon tbe ground, wbicb tbe tbird appears 
to be stabbing witb bis spear, tbe weapon being uplifted. Tbis may 
represent tbe kiUing of a seal. Anotber native is seen approaching 
this group of three, beyond which is the outline of a large mammal, 
evidently intended to represent a deer. 

By again turning the bow upside down, so that the upper line becomes 
the base line, another record presents itself. Tbe grouj) of figures at 
the extreme left denotes two natives occupied in boiling something, as 
their hands are attached to short lines extending into the kettles, which 
arc placed against tbe fire from which the smoke is rising. It is very 
likely that tbey are cooking the meat of the reindeer, as the bide of 
tbe animal is suspended from the horizontal drying pole or scaffold at 
the right, beneath which anotber native is occupied in hanging up the 
meat. The large, irregularly drawn body to tke rigbt of this scaffold 
appears to denote a habitation. Two buman beings are engaged 
between this and a triangular body which may denote a summer habi- 
tation, tbe latter being usually made of bark, canvas, or boards. To 
tbe right of the triangular building is a human being, beside him being 
another scaffold or drying pole from which is suspended the hide of a

suiall mammal. Beyond the middle of the bow, toward the right, is a fig- 
ure of a kaiak with a native within it paddling forward toward a larger 
umiak under sail. In front of this stands a man with a gun uplifted, 
as if shooting toward the deer whose feet are attached to the uj)x>er 
line or base line of the preceding record. Beyond this is the outline of 
another umiak under sail, and occupied by 
three hunters. 

In fig. 143, No. a, is represented a native 
who desired the services of a shaman, and, 
upon visiting one, declared his needs and 
l)robably paid the fee usually required. 

The shaman, making his usual ceremonies 
of incantation to invoke his guardian spirit, 
or tutelary daimon, is shown with that 
creature about to depart on the mission 
desired by the shaman. 

The spirit is a bird, and, as all flying 
creatures are deemed lucky, it is here rei^resented in unusually large 
size, to increase the importance of the performer. 

Another illustration of making incantation is shown in fig. 143Z>, the 
shaman expressing his ability to cause fish to come to the hunter by 
whom the proper fee is paid. The drawing is taken from an Alaskan 
shaman's drum, but appears to be foreign to pure Eskimo drawing, 
having probably originally come from the Thlinkit, or neighboring 
tribes of Athabaskan stock. 

A remarkably interesting engraving is reproduced in fig. 144. The 
profession of the Eskimo shaman is very like that of his confrere of the 
Menomini and Ojibwa Indians, of Wisconsin and Minnesota, respec- 
tively. He has the power to invoke his personal guardian or tutelary 
daimon in aiding him to secure the services of other deities or spirits 
to perform certain acts of exorcism, or incantation and invocation, so 
that a spirit messenger may be sent on almost any mission for informa- 
tion that may be desired j or the guardian spirit or daimon may bring 
about some events, or control the actions of both men and animals, as 

may be desired. 

In the illustration, fig. 
144, is shown first, at No. 
1, an assistant, who aids 
the performer, No. 2, by 
using the magic or 
"medicine drum." No 
doubt a hunter has called, and for a certain consideration, or promise 
of some parts of the game secured, has solicited the shaman for "hunt- 
ing medicine," in order that he may secure a whale. 

The two men, the shaman and his assistant, are both within the 
shaman's lodge, the inclosure or habitation being indicated by the

circular line which surroiiDds them and is planted upon the ground 
or base line. The mystic influence has been made to secure a whale, 
i^o. 4, which has been compelled by the shaman's alleged supernatural 
power, in the guise of an anthropoid deity, to swim to the locality 
where the ceremonies are performed, in order that the hunter may be 
enabled to reach him. The short serrated marking between the whale's 
head and the figure of the spirit denotes the spray spouted from the 
whale. 

The line connecting the spirit and the shaman's hand is the indica- 
tion of the magic influence possessed by the latter over the spirit 
messenger. 

Other illustrations of shamanistic power are given, especially exam- 
ples of exorcism of demons possessing the sick and to whom illness is 
attributed. 

The illustration in tig. 145 is reproduced from a walrus-ivory drill 
bow in the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company, of San Fran- 
cisco, California. The interpretation given to the present writer is as 
follows : 

Two sick men were brought to the shaman for treatment. The 
shaman's summer habitations are represented in Nos. 1 and 2, the

presence of trees denoting that there was a grove close by. No. 3 is the 
shaman, who is represented in the act of holding one of his "demons" 
or personal deities, with whose aid he pretends to expel malignant 
spirits or demons from the body of the sick man. No. 4 is the demon 
under control of the shaman. No. 5 represents the same shaman in the 
act of exorcising the demon in the patient. Nos. 6 and 7 are the sick 
men who are under treatment and from whom the "evil beings" have 
been expelled. The two "evil beings" or demons are shown in No. 
8, represented in violent movement in their endeavor to escape the 
powerful influence of the shaman. 

The engraving presented in plate 73, fig. 3, is without doubt one of 
the cleverest artistic products thus far received from Alaska and 
known to be the work of a native. The entire grou])ing of the herd of 
reindeer, some of the animals walking leisurely along while others stop 
to browse, and while the foremost manifest curiosity and alarm, indi- 
cates that the artist was not only a close observer of the habits of the 
animal, but had an unusually keen acquaintance with the anatomical 
structure and the attitudes assumed under different circumstances so 
as to express the emotions. 



GRAPHIC ART OP THE ESKIMOS. 925 

The hunters, Nos. 18 and 19, had gone to a shaman to seek his aid in 
securing" hick for game, and the shaman (who is represented by tlie 
upper part of the body only, hands outstretched, above the two rein- 
deer, Nos. 11 and 12) being favorably disposed, is driving the game 
in the way of the hunters, his assistants, at Nos. 1, 2, and 5, also driv- 
ing animals by being portrayed as if riding upon their backs. 

No. 4 represents a fiiwn, the open mouth suggesting its crying to its 
parents, while the upper figure at No. 3 and the legless one at the 
space between Xos. 7 and 8 are represented as beyond the first file of 
animals — an attempt at perspective, no doubt. 

The attitudes of Nos. 12 and IG are a good attempt at foreshorten- 
ing, rather a difficult undertaking for a native barbarian. 

A doe is also shown above the animal at No. 16, walking parallel 
with the herd, No. 17, but her legs are supposed to be invisible because 
of her being beyond those in the foreground. 

The herd at No. 17 is portrayed as an elongated body with numerous 
heads and two legs more than necessary for the eight animals indicated. 
In nearly all instances the horns are carefully drawn so as to show the 
peculiar curve toward the front as well as the so-called snow shovels — 
the horns projecting forward and downward over the nose, and by 
means of which the animals cut through the snow in search of lichens 
and other food. 

Nos. 18 and 19 are the hunters with bow and arrow, the attitudes 
assumed in shooting being well represented. No. 20 is the hut. 

In the accompanying illustrations, plate 74, are. three views selected 
from a drill bow, in the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company 
of San Francisco, California. The rod upon which the characters occur 
is here presented in three sections, A, B, and C. In A is found the 
beginning of the narrative of one w^ho applied to a shaman for success 
in hunting; which extends only one-half of the length of the rod. 
The course of the inscription is then continued on the adjacent side of 
the rod at the middle, and reading in both directions (sections B and C), 
toward the two files of approaching animals. Band C occupies the 
whole of one side. 

The following is the explanation of the characters: 

A. No. 1 represents a baidarka, or skin boat, resting on i)oles; this 
is done in order that the vessel may dry. No. 2 is one of the habita- 
tions of the village, as are also those in No. 4, and the storehouses in 
Nos. 5 and 7. No. 3 denotes a tree located in the village. No. 6 is a 
tree, between the branches of which and the roofs of the houses are 
placed poles for drying food— fish, etc. The characters from No. 1 to 
No. 7 signify the settlement, the home of the person to whom the 
history relates. No. 8 is the hunter sitting on the ground asking for 
aid and making the gesture for supplication, asking by elevating both 
hands toward the sky, or toward the one from whom aid is solicited. 
No. 9 is the shaman to whom application is made by the hunter desiring 



926 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895, 

success ill the chase. The shaman has finished his incantations, and 
while still retaining his left arm in the position for that ceremony holds 
the right toward the hunter, giving him the success requested. Ko. 10 
is the shaman's winter lodge, while Nos. 11 and 13 are trees surrounding 
it, as well as the summer habitation noted at No. 12. 

In the illustration, B is a record pertaining to the hunter's previous 
application to another shaman with whom no satisfactory arrangement 
could be made. Consequently, the shaman caused the game to fiee and 
get out of the hunter's way. The detailed description is as follows: 

B. ISTo. 14 is a tree standing beside the habitation No. 15, upon which 
the shaman is observed standing and driving back the game visible 
over the remainder of the scene. No. 10 is a deer, the nearest to and 
the first to feel the shaman's order to return to a safe place. No. 17 
are the horns of a deer protruding from the surface of the river which 
the animal is swimming. No. 18 is a fawn, recognizable also by the 
unusually long legs as compared to the size of the body. 

In the last panel, 0, is recorded the continuation of the story begun 
by the recorder or hunter in A, No. 8. 

No. 19 represents a tree located near the hunter's habitation, which is 
shown in No. 20. The hunter, designated in the attitude of shooting, 
at No. 21, after having been granted the request for success, placed the 
effigy of his totem upon the top of his house as a mark of gratification 
and to insure greater luck in his undertaking. Nos. 22 and 23 embrace ■ 
five deer which were secured, the heads of the animals being turned 
toward the hunter, denoting that the game was captured. No. 24 is 
the shaman's demon driving the game toward the hunter, while in Nos. 
25, 26, 27, and 28 are indicated other demons who were invoked to aid 
the chief tutelary guardian of the shaman primarily invoked for this 
service. 

The figure in No. 25 is a water monster resembling, in this instance, 
a whale, but which is represented by other of the Innuit as a four or 
six legged serpent. The latter idea is common in the mythology of the 
Algonkian tribes; but the existence of such a being in the mythology 
of the Aigalu'jamut and Kiate'jamut, Innuit as well perhaps as among 
others of this nation, seems entirely original with them. 

Plate 04, fig. 2, represents a bone wedge for splitting thin strips of 
wood for fish traps. The specimen is from Nunivak Island, and is 
remarkable for the curious engraving which is shown to exist upon the 
upper surface. It will be observed that the outline within which 
almost all the small figures are drawn denotes a seal, a median line 
extending from the eye backward almost to the tail. Above and 
beneath this arc various figures of guns, animals, plants, and straight 
lines, while upon the reverse, at a point nearly 2 inches from the 
tail, there projects from the median line a many-branched tree, imme- 
diately above which and to either side are shown two reindeer as if 
browsing. These reindeer present a peculiarity which has been

especially noticeable in Znni and Algoiikian i)i('tograpliy to represent 
what is designated as tlie life line. This consists of a line drawn from 
the mouth, or very near it, backward into the body, where it terminates 
in a line, or more generally a triangular figure, to denote the head. It 
is a shamanistic figure, and indicates that the shaman who possessed 
it had infiuence over the life of the animal so portrayed. This subject 
has been more clearly described in connection with the shamanistic 
ceremonies of the Ojibwa Indians in the en- 
graving of the Mide'wiwin or Grand IMedicine 
Society of the Ojibwa, published in the Four- 
teenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Eth- 
nology.

Fig. 14G is coj)ied from a piece of walrus 
ivory in the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company, San Fran- 
cisco, California, and was interpreted to the present writer in San 
Francisco in 1882. 

The left-hand figure is a votive offering or "shaman stick," com- 
monly designated a medicine stick, erected to the memory of one 
departed. The "bird" carvings are considered typical of "good 
spirits," and the above was erected by the remorse- 
jl X/ stricken individual who had killed'the person shown. 

The headless body rej)resents the man who was killed. 

In this respect the Ojibwa manner of portraying a man 

"killed" or "dead" is similar. Comparison with another 

Eskimo drawing-, designating- a "killed whale" by the 

presence in the back of a harpoon, maybe made herewith 

as another conception of the idea of "dead" or "killed." 

^^ The right-hand figure represents the homicide who

..^^P^ for the same idea as made by the Blackfeet and Dakota 

Indians.

tious. These are temporary dwellings, and usually constructed at a 
distance from liome. This also indicates the professiou of a skin liunter, 
as the iiermanent lodges, iudicated as winter bouses, i. e., with round 
or dome-like roof, are located near the seashore, and summer houses 
are only needed when at some distance from home, where a considera- 
ble length of time is spent in hunting. 
The accompanying illustration, fig. 148, is of a similar nature, and is 
erected to the memory of a fisherman.

The interpretation of the characters is as follows: 
Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent various styles of habitations composing 
the village. No. 5 is an elevated structure used for storing food. No. 
6 is a box with wrappings, containing the corpse of a child. Scaffold 
burial is frequent among some of the natives. The small lines, with ball 
attached, are ornamental appendages, consisting of strii)S of cloth or 
skin, with charms, or sometimes tassels. No. 7 is the grave post, bear- 
ing rude illustrations of the Aveapons and utensils used by the deceased

Besides the ornamental appendages, as in No. 6 preceding, there is a 
"shaman stick" erected over the box containing the corpse, as a mark 
of good wishes. 

CONVENTIONALIZING. 

Some examples of decoration are presented herewith, in which there 
often appears to be solely an attempt at ornamenting the otherwise 
plain surface of ivory. In others there are evidences of an advance 
in the graphic representation of objects, in that the originals are no

longer accurately or entirely portrayed, as through an apparent ]n-o- 
cess of syuecdoche conventions are attained, which are thus employed 
for oruamentation, while the original iini)ort of the objects themselves 
sesEis to have been lost sight of, in so far as their use for historic 
records are intended. Some miscellaneous examples will sufilice to 
illustrate these remarks.^ 

Plate 40, Figs. 5, C, and 7 are interesting examples of conventional- 
izing, and indicate a long stride toward the erajdoyment of certain forms 
for decorative purposes or for the ornamentation of spaces upon ivory 
rods or bows that might not otherwise l)e apt to be filled with records 
of exploits or ceremonials. 

The row of thirteen figures in plate 40, fig. 5, are the rear portions of 
whales, the attitude sometimes taken by them in plunging, when the 
tail emerges from the water to an unusual distance. 

The row of fourteen T-shaped characters, fig. C, are conventionalized 
forms to denote the whale, the tail only being drawn to indicate the 
entire animal. Simihir figures are frequently tattooed upon the body 
to denote a successful whaler. Instances are referred to under the cap- 
tion Tattooing, p. 781. In the row marked fig. 7 are shown fifteen swim- 
ming seals, the arrangement being decorative, though, in accordance

with a common custom, they may also have been intended to denote 
many seals captured, an indefinite number of objects often signifying 
many, and more than the actual number indicated, which may be lim- 
ited for want of room. 

Other instances of conventional characters of well-known objects are 
presented elsewhere. 

The regularity with which the seals are portrayed in fig. 150 is 
another illustration of recording the successful hunt for these animals, 
as well as an attempt at utilizing these figures for decorative jmrposes. 

Other illustrations are given herewith, in whicli certain animal forms 
have become so conventionalized as to be almost unrecognizable, and 
in this shape these forms are used secondarily, and perhaps even jiri- 
marily, as decorations, the designs being artistic, as well as of historic 
interest. 



'Since this papei- ■svas pre]>are(l foi- publication there has been issued by Mr. 
Hjalmar Stolpe, of Stoclvliolm, an elegant folio publication on ornamentation, 
entitled " Studier i Amerikausk Oruamentik E Bidrag til ornamentens biologi," 
pp. 42, figures 137, plates XX. 

Eskimo workmaushiii bearing decoraitions occur on figures on pages 10-21. A 
boat paddle, lig. 45, showing both sides, bears a painted face on erne surface; and a 
conventionalized form upon the reverse. This specimen is from Port Clarence, and 
from the fact of its being in color and on wood, is of interest.

930 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Plate 22, fig. 4, represents a drill bow from Point Barrow. There are 
two horizontal median lines, three-sixteenths of an inch apart, extend- 
ing from end to end, from whicli extend toward the onter sides short, 
straight incisions, opposite to each of which are the conventional whale 
tails. This appears to be strictly decorative, the original import as a 
hnnting record having apparently been lost sight of in the attempt at 
ornamentation. 

Plate 22, fig. 3, represents another specimen of like character from 
the same locality as the preceding. It measures 1(3 inches in length 
along the dorsum. Apart from the two perfora- 
tions which exist at either end of the bow, there 
are larger holes made for the insertion of turquoise 
or blue glass beads. On the under surface are 
represented skins of a number of animals. The 
ten narrow hides at the left are otter skins. The 
succeeding five oblong figures with interior cross hatchings are proba- 
bly bear hides. The remaining figures to the right, ten in number, 
represent the skins of the deer. A very decided attempt is shown in 
this illustration at ornamental decoration as well as j^reserving a hunt- 
ing record, as the figures are intended to be represented as nearly alike 
as possible, the skin of each species of animal being almost exactly 
like others of its species. 

One of the drill bows bears a series of illustrations of habitations, 
various forms being indicated, so as to readily connect the extremes. 
The normal form is shown in fig. 151, while the more conventionalized 
outline, which would, if alone, be difficult of specific identification, is 
shown in fig. 152. 

Plate 40, fig. 7, represents a series of seals, the object of which is 
rather in the order of a decoration thau as a hunting record. The 
carving is deep, and characteristic of the work of the natives from 
whom it was obtained at Cape JSTonie. A like form 
of representing seals is shown elsewhere. 

The various panels in plate GO, fig. 2, contain vseals 
at either end, as Nos. 1 and 11, while the bars of ver- 
tical lines separate the intervening portion of the 
ivory rod into other panels, containing single figures 
of trees, in regular order and rather conventional, and in this state 
resulting, in reality, in merely a subject of no history, but of decorative 
or ornamental import. 

At Ko. 11 a new record was begun; a man is seated, and is appar- 
ently preparing some article of diet. 

Plate 63, fig 4, represents a drill bow from Kotzebue Sound. The 
specimen measures 18i inches in length, and is decorated upon the 
side shown in the illustration by two rows of seals equidistant from 
one another and so arranged as to represent a method of ornamenta- 
tion rather than a historical record. The great number of seals may 




GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 931 

indicate, as in other records, that the hunter was a very successful seal 
hunter. Upon the opposite or convex side is a similar portrayal of 
animal forms, thougii in this instance only one continuous row of 
spouting whales occupies the base line, while along the upper line but 
four of these animals liave been drawn, the remaining eight spaces 
being blank. One edge of tins bow is very crudely but deeply incised 
with strange looking tigures representing human beings with alligator 
heads, armed with mandibles similar to those of huge birds. Several 
mammalian forms are also represented, one or two being of mythic 
import. Several kaiaks are also shown, the occupants being engaged 
in walrus and seal hunting. 

Plate 21, fig. 1, is the back of the bow drill represented in plate 3, 
fig. 1. Considerable interest is attached to this specimen from the fact 
of the pronounced median lines extending from end to end, the various 
objects between these and the outer margin being so arranged as to 
form a very symmetrical and decorative figure. This approaches very 
nearly one variety of decoration practiced by the Papuans, and referred 
to by Mr. Alfred C. Iladdon.^ 

The specimen is inverted and the interpretation begins at the first 
figure at the right, which represents a man in a kaiak following four 
seals. The two figures extending above and below the median line are 
bear skins. The two elongated figures at the narrow portion of the 
bow are otter skins. These are succeeded at the next widening of 
the bow by the representation of another bear skin, and so on alter- 
nately to the extreme right, in addition to the last otter skins there 
being still two added because of the narrowness of that portion of 
the bow. The space beyond the perforation in the bow at the extreme 
right is ornamented also. 

Plate 24, figs. 5 and 6, represents two ivory bodkins, both from Norton 
Sound, Avhere they were obtained from Mr. E. W. Xelson. They are each 
about lOA inches in length. The specimen shown in fig. 5 is sharj)ly 
pointed at either end and has three decorated sides. On the plate the 
illustration is inverted so that the triangles with projecting lines which 
represent summer habitations are misleading. In this instance the 
figure of the summer habitation has been adopted as a means of deco- 
ration only and has no special import. Upon the next side, the edge 
of which is partly visible, are the figures of eight walruses, also i)laced 
upon the utensil simply as a means of decoration. Upon each of the 
three sides appears a deeply creased base line, and at intervals of 
about one inch are oblique lines one-eighth of an inch in length placed 
almost together, closely resembling one of the forms utilized to denote 
or indicate the '^ Finback " whale. The signification of these charac- 
ters, however, can not be determined. They are believed to represent 
decorative marks only. 

Plate 24, fig. 0, represents a bodkin, only one end of which is sharp-

932 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

eiietl, the other end terminating in a seal bead. The four sides of the 
specimen are decorated, the first, shown in the illustration, bearing six 
figures composed of the rear halves of whales joined together so as to 
present flukes symmetrically at either end. On the second side are out- 
lines of seven triangular summer habitations, on the right-hand slope 
of which are two projecting lines, similar almost to the lines in the pre- 
ceding figure representing summer habitations. On the third side are 
engraved figures of seven wolves, while upon the fourth side is a single 
horizontal line with other obliipie lines extending therefrom at inter- 
vals of about an inch, similar to the groups of threes in the preceding 
figure. 

Plate 21, fig. 5, represents a drill bow from Kotzebue Sound, measur- 
ing 17f inches in length. It is made of yellowish and old looking 
ivory, the dorsum being round while the under surface has two divided 
faces. The animals represented upon these are wolves, and are evi- 
dently arranged in snch manner as to present a pictorial result rather 
than a hunting record. It is possible that the hunter may have been a 
wolf hunter and intended in this manner to illustrate his great success, 
as a great number frequently indicates an indefinite number — that is, a 
larger number gather<'d during a lifetime than could conveniently be

portrayed on so small a surface. A similar idea obtains in gesture 
language, in which the native will i)ass his hands upward and outward 
as if outlining a heap of some soft material, tliis gesture signifying 
large or many; an indefinite number signifying a great many, in con- 
tradistinction to a limited number which would be indicated by ges- 
tures of an entirely different form. 

The specimen shown in plate 37, fig. 6, is part of a drill bow which 
is nearly 25 inches in length. Upon one surface the utensil is deco- 
rated with figures of seventeen reindeer and nine bear skins, rather 
decorative than as a hunting record, while upon that side visible in the 
illustration thirty-seven skins of the seal are drawn, the interior of 
these objects being decorated with short lines extending from the outer 
line inward toward the middle of the body, while the median line 
extending through the middle of the hide is similarly etched toward 
the outer side, leaving the two white spaces as a series of zigzags. 

I*late 59, fig. 1, represents a drill bow from Nubriakh, collected by 
Mr. E. W. Xelson. The characters represent bearskins, and are placed 
almost at equal distances from one another across the entire length of 
the spe(;imen, to represent ornamentation rather than a record of 
exjdoits.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 933 

The nine crude outlines sliowu in fig. l.")3 represent tliat number of 
bears killed during the lifetime of the owner of the record. 

The skins are here suspeuded from upright poles or posts, and the 
arrangement of figures has, in other instances, suggested patterns for 
decorative purposes, as will be observed elsewhere in connection with 
the subject pertaining thereto. 

Figs. 7 and 8 of plate 50 are spear guards usually attached to the 
upper surface of the canoe so as to form a secure guard upon which 
the spear is placed. Both of these guards are decorated with concentric 
rings, both different. Upon the outer line in fig. 7 we perceive diverg- 
ing short lines terminating in the conventional V-shape or tree figure, 
while in the other, fig. 8, will be perceived the plain line, which may 
perhaps refer to the flower symbol noted in fig. 4 of plate 50, and 
described elsewhere in Mr. Turner's communication. See also plate 75 
bearing various forms of native patterns of circles. 

Plate 38 represents four ivory bag handles, of which fig. 1 is from 
Norton Sound. It bears upon the upper side four sets of concentric 
circles, equidistant from one another, and connected by a median line, 
above and below which are a pair of radiating diagonal lines appar- 
ently denoting the conventional symbol of whale fins. This specimen 
is similarly marked upon the bottom side and convex edge. With ref- 
erence to this ornamentation, it is one step beyond that represented in 
plate 29, fig. 2, which was obtained at St. Michaels, and upon one side 
of which are shown five sets of concentric circles similarly connected 
by median lines, but without the lateral radiating lines above noticed. 

On plate 38, fig. 3, is shown another bag handle upon which appear 
seven sets of concentric circles, which, however, are smaller than those 
shown on the two preceding specimens, plate 38, figs. 1, 2. The design 
shown in fig. 3 appears to be the primary mode of decoration, as in 
this there are no connecting lines. 

Plate 48 represents a variety of ear pendants from several localities 
on the west coast of Alaska. The chief feature of these specimens 
consists in the variety of ornamentation. Simi)le dots made by drill- 
ing, concentric rings, nucleated circles, and in one specimen — fig. 8 — a 
series of serrations attached to two of the circles, comprise the chief 
features of ornamentation. Fig. 9, however, represents a powder 
charger consisting of a bell-shaped implement, hollow beneath, Avith 
just sufticient cavity to contain one charge of powder. The nucleated 
circles upon this specimen are among the smallest thus far found in 
the collections of the National Museum. The arrangement of the cir- 
cles, also, is artistic and geometrical. Those attached to lines extend- 
ing from the ring, and apparently suspended therefrom, are, without 
doubt, flower symbols, as midway between the circle and the upper 
ring are short lines denoting leaves. This is probably the blossom or 
fruit of the cranherry — Vacciitium Yitisichva. 

Around the lower border of the utensil is a delicately incised line. 



934 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

small nucleated -circles alternating- witli vertical lines terminating 
above in a similar small nucleated circle, from whicli diverge two short 
lines, wliich in turn end in similar rings. The entire outline of the 
character is that of the simpler form of the tree symbol, though it is 
believed to denote the fruit of the arctic plant known as the Vaccinium. 
This belief is strengthened by the occurrence of similar characters 
known to denote this plant, and from \Thich a native carrying a bucket 
or kantag is shown as in the act of plucking fruit. Compare fig. 70, p. 863. 

Above these characters are a series of larger nucleated rings, each 
with three radiating lines, which are without doubt intended to repre- 
sent the flowers of this same plant. That the circle with such exter- 
nal ornamental appendages is intended to represent floAvers has been 
explained in Mr. Turner's communication above noted. 

The circles portrayed upon this specimen are the most delicate found 
upon any of the specimens in the National Museum. They are appar- 
ently the work of an expert workman, and made with comparatively 
delicate instruments. 

The arrangement of nucleated rings in the form of a triangle and 
connected by short lines, as in the fruit or plant character above noted, 
appearjs upon some Thlinkit bone ornaments shown in plate 9, fig. 3. 
The transmission of the character, or its suggestion, ajjpears to have 
come from the Innuit, the southern tribes being known to make this 
pattern, and the intertribal relations with their eastern and sonthern 
neighbors is constant. Being a shaman's ornament among the Thlinkit 
would suggest the idea that tlie original signification of the character 
was unknown to them. 

Plate G8, fig. fi, represents a very beautiful rod of ivory from Kotzebue 
Sound. It is perforated at one end like a bag handle, but sharpened 
at the other in imitation of a bodkin. Three sides are decorated. The 
peculiarity of the ornamentation is the insertion in the blank spaces of 
nucleated rings, their association with these hunting expeditions being 
very much in imitation of the characters upon the petroglyphs at 
Bohusliin, in Sweden, and shown in plates 75, 70, and others of like 
character, showing simple nuclei or pits, as well as nucleated circles 
attached to lines to represent human beings, exactly like some found 
in the Shoshoneau area of southern Kevada and in the Moki country. 
The illustration in plate 75 represents at the extreme left four vertical 
lines, with the zigzag and toothed pattern found upon other objects, 
which has been designated as the fisli trap or seal tooth pattern. The 
next figure, a crescent, and is a symbolical whale tail. The two bars 
leaning toward one another, between the whale tail and the walrus, 
are the rude outlines of the sides of a habitation, the delicate indication 
of the occupants within being shown. The remaining figures, as will 
be observed, consist of a kaiak and several whales and walruses. The 
groups upon the other sides of this rod are very much in imitation of 
the preceding.

Other iuteresting and similar illustrations of nucleated rings, in con- 
nection with lines to denote human beings, are given by Hans Hilde- 
brand,' as also concentric circles and simple nuclei in the same work, 
page 381. These illustrations are of petroglyphs, and it is evident that 
in the first named instance the nucleated ring is the head of an oarsman, 
or perhaps one in authority, as most of the designations for the rowers 
are alike in length and form, whereas the nucleated figures are always 
nearer one end of the vessel. 

Plate 31, fig. 3, bears ui)on one side a median incision, upon the upper 
sides of which are represented a series of conventionalized trees. Upon 
the reverse are similar tree patterns, but drawn at obli«jue angles, all 
leaning toward the left. 

In the figure of a ship's anchor chain the links are indicated. by draw- 
ing the chain zigzag. This is found to occur in only one instance, as 
shown on plate 40, fig. 2. 

Other interesting examples of conventionalizing are shown in the 
distinction between the portrayal of an ice fioe, being a simple curved 
line as in No. 5 of fig. 112, to denote transparency of substance, while 
the walrus upon it is incised and the surface blackened. 

A similar view of walrus upon rocks is shown in fig. 3 on plate 70, 
the rocks being outlined somewhat after the order of a floe, though, to 
show the solid and creased sides of the dark material, the pictograph 
is incised with the zigzag-like i)attern, frequently illustrated in orna- 
mental borders as the fish-trap pattern. 

Plate 38, fig. 4, shows a bag handle from Point Hope. The outer 
edges are scalloped, a small circular excision appearing at the points 
where these scallops should terminate, each of these excisions being 
furthermore ornamented by a circular line which surrounds it and from 
which radiate shorter lines at right angles like the rays of the sun. 
In the middle of the handle, extending from end to end, is a high, 
rounded ridge, at each side of which is a median line; on the sides 
facing the circular excisions are two short lines directed outward, while 
midway between these points are two shorter lines directed inward 
toward one another. 

Plate 78 represents part of a page from a whaleman's log book, being 
a journal of the bark Peri, Captain E. Eussell, who sailed Friday, June 
29, 1854, from New Bedford, Mass., for the Indian Ocean, on a sperm- 
whaling voyage, and returned May 26, 1857. As will be observed by 
reference to the illustrations, the note under date of Tuesday, Decem- 
ber 11, 1855, is as follows:

extreme left is an iDScriptiou, "16th time of seeing tliem," denoting 
that it Avas the sixteenth time that whales had been sighted. The 
letters at the tail end of the whales, W B, S B, and L B, denote waist 
boat, starboard boat, and larboard boat, two whales being captured by 
the first and second, while three were taken by the last named. At 
the right of the whales are the numbers of barrels of oil furnished by 
each, as well as the total, amounting to 146. The method of stamping 
these outlines is by means of small wooden blocks, which are dipped in 
ink or other coloring matter, for the reason that the picture of the 
whale is so readily perceived, obviating the necessity of searching over 
each page to find any special reference thereto in the manuscript text. 

On plate 71) is represented another part of the same log book, and 
under date of Monday, July 21, 1856, are two references, the first, "29 
time of seeing," and another "30th time," referring to the characters 
of whale's flukes or tails standing upright, and denoting in this con- 
nection that the whales were sighted but not captured. 

On plate 80 are represented five specimens of Eskimo carvings which 
are of interest in this connection. 

In fig. 1 is shown a very short kantag, or perhaps bag handle, from 
Sledge Island, the original measuring but about 2i inches in length, 
while the perforations along the top ridge separate the pieces of ivory 
into a series of connected flukes. These are better illustrated on fig. 
3, a specimen from Cape Darby, in which the whale tails are almost 
separated from one another, slightly bent to one side, and ver> natural 
in general outline. 

In fig. 4 is shown another neat specimen from Sledge Island, while in 
fig. 2 we have one made of a piece of hollow ivory or bone, in which 
both ridges are rudely perforated so as to simulate whale tails, as in 
the preceding illustrations. These four specimens are of interest, from 
the fact that the flukes are utilized in the decoration or ornamentation 
of utensils, and probably at the same time denoting that the owner 
was a whale hunter or had been successful in catching whales. The 
most interesting specimen in the series, however, is that given in fig. 5, 
which represents a kantag handle from Point Hope. This specimen, 
in addition to having the carving of a whale fluke at the upper edge, 
has neatly engraved upon one side four flukes, flanked on either side 
by a bowhead whale facing inward. The six figures are arranged 
artistically and symmetrically, and are almost exactly of the same 
class of ornamentation as in plate 80. 

The question would naturally arise whether the Eskimo had copied 
such methods of portrayal from the whalers, or the whalers from the 
Eskimo, or whether the art evolved independently among both. 

In consultation with Captain E. P. Herendeen, now of Washington, 
District of Columbia, a gentleman who has spent many years in the 
Arctic regions, I am informed by him that he made his first whaling 
voyage toward Point Barrow in the year 1854. At that time he found

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 937 

in possession of the natives of Point Barrow innumerable specimens 
of ivory upon whicli were engraved similar outlines of flukes and 
whales, both of which had reference to whaling expeditions. Captain 
Herendeen believes also that the Innuit practiced this method of 
indicating a whale, by simply portraying its tail, prior to the voyages 
to that part of tlie Arctic ocean of the whalers. This is a question 
that can not now be satisfactorily determined when we come to remem- 
ber the early arrival in that part of the Arctic regions of the Eussians 
and people of other nationalties, all of whom came for purposes of 
exploration aud i)robably trafQc. The practice of portraying but part 
of an animal for the whole, known as synecdoche, is very common 
among some of our native Indian tribes, and it seems to have resulted 
chiefly, perhaps, as labor saving, and also perhaps because many of 
the natives may have had occasion to portray certain animals by only 
the most conspicuous parts to represent the whole, as the observer 
would readily understand the intention of the artist. Such a process 
of pictography is particularly prevalent among the Dakota and other 
of the Plains Indians, especially in connec- 
tion with the indication of proper names, in 
which the human head is drawn with a 
short line, issuing from the mouth and run- 
ning ujiward from the head, connecting ig io4.

thereby the object or animal which suggests 

the name of the person; and in which the line denotes speech, in imi- 
tation of the common gesture sign made by passing the linger forward 
from the month, denoting "That is it," instead of simply passing the 
linger forward to denote speech generically; the latter would be indi- 
cated in pictographs only by a short straight line, extending forward 
and perhaps slightly curved, but not attached to any object. 

In comparison with the iJreceding remarks concerning the conventional 
fluke, the accompanying designs on fig. 154 are reproduced from a 
specimen from Cape Nome. The forms are diverse, yet both are accu- 
rate in suggesting the original which furnished the concept. 

Such T-sliaped figures, denoting flukes, are tattooed upon the body 
to signify that the person so decorated is a successful whaler, lieference 
to several localities where the natives practice this method of personal 
adornment, to indicate also individual achievement, will be found under 
the caption of Tattooing, p. 781. 

Plate 14, fig. 3, represents a kantag or bucket handle from Norton 
Sound. Upon this specimen is engraved a wolf, to the right of which 
are two grazing reindeer, while the fourth and fifth characters repre- 
sent hides or skins of bear iflaced in an upright position so as to 
almost resemble the tree symbol. To the right of this is a habitation 
with smoke rising from the smoke hole, and a native approaching the 
entrance. Along the upper margin of this specimen are two seals at 
the left, and a whale's fluke, indicating that a whale was seen by the 



938 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

uatives in the boat to the right. This portrayal of the whale's fluke, 
although utilized as a simple ornament or decorative design in many 
instances, is here portrayed in imitation of the system adopted by the 
New England whalers, as represented in plate SO. 

Plate 08, fig. 1, is a drill bow from Cape Nome, 15i inches in length 
and f of an inch square. Upon the side shown in the illustration are 
a series of semicircles, with tooth-like attachments on the upper sur- 
face, the interior being filled in with vertical Hues. Between each of 
these semicircles is a cross-like figure denoting a bird. The semicircles 
themselves are conventional characters to represent whales. 

At the extreme right is the outline of a reindeer facing toward a 
native, who has his arms in the attitude as if holding a bow, part of 
the character being obliterated. Upon the opposite side of this bow 
are a number of curious looking objects somewhat resembling the gen- 
eral outline of a whale with a peculiar mandible-like attachment extend- 
ing upward and forward from the head, wliile to the back are attached 
short, inclined lines almost resembling harpoons. The fact that these 
short lines are placed in position by pairs indicates that they denote 
legs, the mandible being in reality the mouth of the mythic creature 
which it represents lying upon its back with the feet uppermost. At 
the extreme right of this record are three small creatures of the same 
species, though not as carefully represented as the i»receding ones. 

Upon the top of the bow the left and middle portion is occupied by 
reindeer, and a habitation, near to which is a meat rack and human 
figures with arms outstretched. At the right of the record is a very 
delicately engraved picture of a village with six habitations. 

The bottom of the bow is ornamented by a continuous line of nucle- 
ated lings of several sizes, the central perforations in nearly every 
instance being unusually deep, while the rings themselves surround- 
ing the perforations are generally deeper on one side as if the instru- 
ment with which they were made had not been held directly at right 
angles with the surface operated upon. 

COMPARISON. 

Plate 81 represents a '^ History of a Year of the Chukch." Et is repro- 
duced from a lithographic print by Doctor Carlos Bovallius, and is in 
imitation of the original, drawn on walrus skin, and it is alleged to 
have been the work of some Chukche natives. It is not known whether 
Doctor Bovallius has published a history iu detail of this pictograi)hic 
record, but attention was called to the record by Doctor Walter Hough 
of tlie National Museum, who received the above information, in turn, 
from Doctor Bovallius, to the efiect that the record refers to the avoca- 
tions and hunts of one entire year. 

The preceding paragraph was written one year ago and the interpre- 
tation given at that time, and in connection therewith, was based upon 
the application of Eskimo pictographs of known signification, and 
upon information possessed relative to such interpretation in general.

OF THE ChUKCH." 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 939 

Having witliin tlie past few days had opportunity, and occasion, to 
furtlier examine the literature bearing upon the Swedisli Pohir Expe- 
ditions, I learu that this plate forms one of the illustrations given by 
Mr. Hans Hildebrand in his monograph on primitive art, and forming 
a chapter in one of Baron iSTordenskiold's works.' In speaking of the 
generally intelligible state of the pictographic characters, he remarks 
as follows: 

"Icli will es allerdings nicht auf micli nehmen, von alien diesen Bil- 
dern eine befriedigende Erkliirung zu gebeu, die Hauptziige sind jedoch 
so deutlich, das sie nicht misverstanden werden Konnen. Nahe den 
Contouren der Haut laufen auf beinahe alien seiteu breite Linien, 
welchc an mehreren Stellen zu breiten Flecken aufschuellen. Diese 
Linien stellen den Strand dar,die Flecken sind zuweilen Huhen, zuweilen 
Zelte, die letzen tlieils an den regelmJissigen Konischen Formen, theils 
an den fiber die Zeltspitze hinausgehenden Enden der das Gerippe des 
Zeltes bildenden Stangen erkennbar — diese Kleinen hervorstehenden 
Enden finden sich aucli auf den modernen Abbildungen der Tchukt- 
scheu-Dorfer.'' 

The following interpretation is given as viewed from the Eskimo 
standiDoint, as the entire collection of figures of animals, whales, ships, 
human beings, and every other character is typically Eskimo, and the 
system of recording, as well as the type of characters themselves, was 
undoubtedly obtained from the Eskimo by copying other like records 
of ivory obtained from the natives of the American coast, or possibly 
from the Yuit, who are near neighbors of the Chukche, and who are, 
furthermore, the Asiatic representatives of the Eskimo. I^either is it 
known that the Chukche were at all proficient, originally, in recording 
pictorially their records, literature being generally silent on that sub- 
ject, and nothing apjjears in the collections of the National Museum 
that bears any relation to ornamentation of any character whatever 
and marked as of Chukche origin. 

Believing therefore that the record under discussion is Eskimo, the 
interpretation is given from the standpoint of our knowledge of Indian 
characters. The presence of the two disks, IsTos. 1 and 2, denote the 
sun, ;N"o. 1 being in Indian pictography a hlacJc sun, or night, while Xo. 
2 represents the summer sun as it usually appears a little above the 
northern horizon. These two scenes therefore would confirm the state- 
ment given by Doctor Bovallius as covering the period of one year. 
About the outer margin of this record, and marked by indentations 
and irregularities, appears the shore line, upon the outer margin of 
which toward the border of the record are various scenes depicted as 
occurring upon a solid surface, while within the line generally are 
various scenes, as whale hunting, etc. The outlines of habitations are 
also scattered at intervals, as in Nos. 3 and 4, apparently in the midst 

'Studier och Forskuingar foranledda af mina resor i hoga nordeu. Stockholm, 
1884. Pis. and ill. This work was repriuted in Leipzig, 1885, under the title of 
"Studieu uud Forschungeu veraulasst durch meine reisen ini hohen Norden.'' 



940 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

of tlie water, but this results, no doubt, from the fact that large blank 
spaces had been left after the aquatic scenes were completed, and the 
habitations were then placed upon the most available space. In No. 3 
will be observed a vertical pole with cords stretched out to various 
sides of the pole, while beneath are represented four human beiugs. 
The import of this is not clear, but in fig. 4 we have the outline of an 
underground habitation very similar to many of those represented on 
the ivory rods. Over the entrance is placed a votive offering, shown 
by a vertical line with a short cross line attached to the top, beneath 
which is a human being with arms extended from the head as if reach- 
ing to something above him. Upon the dome-shaped portion of the 
habitation are three human beings, one crawling by the side, while 
two are engaged in peeping down through the smoke hole to see Avhat 
is going on within. On the inside are three natives, one on the floor, 
while the second is seated on the bench or projecting boards placed 
around the interior, which also serve as beds, while the third appears 
to be hanging by his feet from a horizontal bar. Whether this is sim- 
ply an acrobatic feat or not, we have no means of determining. At No. 
5 is another object in the shape of a parallelogram within which two 
human-like objects are seated, facing in opposite directions. Tiiese 
characters are very similar to the Shoshonian pictographs as found 
among the cliff remains of northwestern Arizona. The hands of one 
of these characters are elevated, with the fingers outspread, as if 
making gestures, while the other has his liands placed toward the 
ground, with fingers spread. It is probable that this represents some 
shamanistic idea. 

Among the various representations of umiaks are some very interest- 
ing ones, those in Nos. C, 7, and 8 being particularly well drawn. At 
No. 9 is one Avhich very much resembles the petroglyphs, or the petro- 
graphic representation of boats as found in Sweden, of which an illus- 
tration is given in plate 70, A fine illustration of harpooning is shown 
in No. 10, the floats being attached to the line, while the animal is 
shown as attempting to escape, at the same time blowing water above 
his head. A similar exploit is shown in No. 11, the harpoon having 
been cast and the whale followed by the umiak represented in No. 12. 
In No. 13 is shown an umiak, from which a harpoon is being thrown at 
a seal, while the native in the stern is elevating his paddle in imitation 
of the signal to denote concentration. This is a notice to the accom- 
panying kaiaks that the harpoon has been cast and that the assisting 
hunters are to surround the animal struck. 

In No. 14 we have the interesting illustration of a whale being 
harpooned, the float appearing beliiud, while a second harpoon has 
been thrown into him, the line of which is still attached to an umiak, 
which in turn is connected by a continuous line to a second umiak, 
both boat loads of hunters in this wise keeping up with their foray. 
In No. 15 a whale is likewise shown with two harpoons and floating 
lines attached. 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 941 

Upon the opposite side of the illustration is seen a pregnant wbale 
(fig. 10), the body of tlie larger animal being lifted partly, while within 
is portrayed a smaller whale with the head directed toward the head 
of its parent. A little to the left of this are some well- drawn illustra- 
tions of sledges, to which three dogs are hitched, ISTo. 17, while around to 
the left are the outlines of several natives holding their arms aloft as if 
experiencing surprise or joy at something in which they are interested. 
At !No. 18 is shown an indentation representing a little inlet in which 
a whaler is shown anchored. Near the vessel are natives in various 
attitudes, as if engaged in conversation or barter, while above, in No, 
19, are four small triangular bodies projecting toward the water, which 
denote habitations, very much in form like the ordinary Indian tent. 

At No. 20 is the outline of a large bear being attacked by twG 
natives, the one in front pretending to strike him with some large 
object, while the man behind him is in the attitude of using a spear. 
Quite a settlement is represented at a projecting i)oint of land. No. 21, 
the lines upon which are continuous dark bodies, both round and tri- 
angular, representing habitations of various kinds. 

In No. 22 are represented six small scaffolds, and from the opposite 
side of this point are three otliers which may represent burial scaffolds, 
or they may possibly be intended for food storage onlj'. At No. 2.3 is 
the shore line, the short projecting lines radiating therefrom ap])ar- 
ently denoting sedges or grass, while the lines extending around the 
village appear to denote a rise in the land corresponding to the con- 
tour lines. In No. 24 is shown an individual upon a loft, with arms 
outstretched, as if making signals. In No. 25 two habitations are 
shown, with another scaftold denoting the end of the settlement. The 
inclosure between Nos. 24 and 25, within which are vast numbers of 
short lines, seems to denote a marsh with sedges, or reeds, or other 
aquatic plants, while in No. 26 we have a continuous line of blackened 
spots denoting the contour of a mountain range upon which we lind at 
several points human beings, one with a spear, while another has his 
arms outstretched as if attracting attention. Beyond this range are 
indicated various animals, conspicuous amongst them being the deer. 
This ppi^arently denotes a hunting ground. At No. 27 is another inlet 
in which are represented three whalers or whaling ships, while ui)on 
the shore we tind two pairs of human beings in which one person of 
each pair seems to hand forward some object to the other, who is 
shown with outstretched arms as if to receive it. About the ships are 
shown numbers of umiaks loaded with natives Avho have come to trade. 
In No. 28 is another indication of a bear hunt, three natives partici- 
pating in this attack, two armed with bows and arrows, while the third 
has only a spear. In No. 29 is shown what appears to be a hostile 
encounter between several natives, and actual hostility is taking jdace 
as shown in No. 30, where two are engaged in grappling with one 
another, while their companions stand by in various attitudes of sur- 
prise or alarm. 



942 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Aloug the shore line iudicated at ISTo. 31 are numbers of liabitations 
and scaffolds, as observed elsewhere, while at No. 32 are a series of 
black i)rojections which evideutlj^ denote hills, as these are also shown 
at No. 26. The native shown in No. 33 appears to have shot an arrow 
into some animal, while the native in front of the latter is in the atti- 
tude of thrusting- his spear. Absence of horns seems to indicate a doe, 
or possibly a bear, although the length of the limbs would preclude the 
latter idea. At No. 34, however, the figure of a bear is drawn more 
carefully. In No. 35 is shown a herd of reindeer, while in No. 36 is 
shown another whaling ship, beneath which are four kaiaks loaded 
with individuals who have come after trade. A curious illustration is 
that shown in No. 37, in which quite a string of reindeer are attached 
to sledges. The native in No. 38 is apparently driving back the ani- 
mals who are heading off" in that direction. In No. 39 is the outline of 
a habitation with the accompanying hoiizontal rack, from which meat 
or other food is shown suspended. The cliaracter in No. 40 is, without 
doubt, the outline of a net, and resembles in almost every respect sim- 
ilar ones found in the pictographs made by the natives of the American 
coast. In No. 41 is a horizontal line with five animal heads protruding. 
These would seem to denote walruses, but from the fact of the projec- 
tions above the head they are probably intended for deer who have 
broken through the ice, or maybe swimming, toward which the umiaks 
are hastening, as shown above. No. 42 represents a number of individ- 
uals with arms extended and hands directed toward the ground, which 
resemble very much some of the characters on the drill bow (plate 68, 
fig. 3. 

Since the above interpretation was dictated, I have had the oppor- 
tunity to consult Captain E. P. Herendeen, a gentleman thoroughly 
familiar with the country and the natives of both sides of Bering 
Strait. Upon submitting to him the chart for his examination as to 
the geographic location referred to, the following additional informa- 
tion was obtained, as well as his approval in the belief that the coast 
natives [Eskimo] were more likely the authors of the record than the 
"Deermen" [ChuckcheJ. 

That part of the record marked No, 40 comprises the coast of the 
Holy Cross Gulf; and extending backward to No. 18, which denotes 
Plover Bay, are observed whales and a whaling ship, denoting a com- 
mon occurrence in past years for whalers to enter one of the numerous 
inlets, seek a good anchorage, and there make the required catches 
instead of sailing in the open sea. Whalers are said to have been 
common at almost every favorable point. 

The point of land at No. 19 is East Head, and is precipitous, while a 
small village is located near the entrance, of which my informant could 
not give me the native name. Opposite the hull of the vessel is a long, 
narrow black line, which rein^esents a sharp spit of land actually occur- 
ring at that point in Plover Bay. 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 943 

At No. 23 is a point of laud which is recognized as Indian Point. 
Tlie shore has a rocky appearance, and immediately back from the 
surf line appear some contour lines, upon which are the representation 
of scaft'olds, as before noted, which Captain Herendeen says are caches 
of the natives, while the houses are scattered along in rows. The 
irregular area between the village and the ridge of hills at No. 26 is a 
marsh. The hills are also in actual existence and beyond them is a good 
hunting ground, as indicated by the artist. 

To the right of Indian Point, in the midst of an inlet at No. 43, is 
Arakan Island, formed like a hump, with a straight line on one side to 
denote the water line. The line at No. 44 covers an inhabited stretch of 
land, commonly called the Michigme, and located on a bay of the same 
name. Several habitations are visible, and a number of human forms 
are drawn near to them. 

At the right-hand end of the Michigme settlement is an inlet show- 
ing three whales, near each of which is a pair of human beings, one 
j)erson in the act of handing to the other some object, the import being 
trade, the purpose of the visit of the natives. 

The lower or opposite shore, marked Nos. 30, 31, 34, and 36, Captain 
Herendeen is not positive whether it may represent a continuation of 
the Asiatic shore or St. Lawrence Island, the locality where the Asiatic 
coast natives obtain oil and various articles with which their country 
is not well stocked, returning therefor wooden vessels, poles for tents, 
frames for boats, etc., which are primarily obtained from the Chuckche, 
as the latter come from the inland regions by means of sledges, as shown 
at No. 17. 

From the general appearance of the drawings, the continuity of shore 
lines, with the exception of a small and apparently insignificant break 
at No. 45, would indicate that the Asiatic side alone was intended 
to be shown, and not the opposite American shore. The statement, 
too, that the record is a "year's record" should also be taken into 
consideration. 

At No. 46 is an indentation jirobably intended to represent St. Law- 
rence Bay. There is quite a herd of seals indicated, clearly denoting 
the i^resence there in great numbers of that aninuil. Habitations of 
variouskinds line the shore line, to indicate a settlement of natives. At 
No. 47 is shown a harpooned walrus, followed by a native in a kaiak, 
who has his arm raised as if about to cast a second weapon. No. 48 
has already been alluded to as a marsh, the short lines being indica- 
tive of the sedges growing at that locality. No. 49 is a skin tent, near 
which is lying upon the ground what appears to be intended for a 
sledge. The latter is in imitation of the Chuckche type, as may be 
observed by comparing those at the opposite side of the chart in con- 
nection with the sledges to which reindeer are hitched, near No. 39. 

The general resemblance of these teams of the Chukche is, in gen- 
eral, very much like those of the Samoyeds, and I can not refrain from 



944 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

introduciug- lierewitb as plate 82' an illu.stration published by Mr. 
Jacksou in liis work on "The Great Frozen Lraid," which illustration 
is a reproduction from a photograph. The middle, covered sledge, is 
one used by women, the remaining one being for goods and men. 

Ko. 50 denotes a village, the tent poles protruding from the tops of 
theledges. Along the shore are more habitations, and two umiaks filled 
with hunters are shown in the water. At No. 51 are two natives 
making an attack upon a bear. One of the hunters has a spear, while 
the other is armed with bow and arrow. A third hunter, a little to the 
right, has shot his arrow into the animal, and has extended his open 
hand outward, to indicate to the others that he has "cast a Aveapon," 
in imitation of the custom of whalers when they elevate the paddle, 
or spread hands, to inform their companions of their action and to 
request concentration of boats to secure the game. 

At No. 52 is a group of six men. Two are going forward with a spear, 
while the two in the middle are making gestures. The pair at the right 
are in close embrace, apparently in combat. No. 53 illustrates the 
method of spearing seal thnmgh the ice, very similar to that shown at 
No. 31. The small ring, however, denotes the breathing hole made by 
the seal, this being absent in the latter instance. Nos. 54, 55, and 56 
are obscene figures, and not worthy of reproduction. 

Various illustrations of Chuckche ;?rt are given by Mr. Hans Hilde- 
brand,^ and in every instance the products resemble the figures on 
plate 10, and appear as if they had been drawn with a ])encil or 
sharply-pointed brush. The general type of the portrayals are like those 
of the Eskimo, clearly showing artistic relationship. In the same con- 
nection are shown, also, a series of line drawings, rei)roductions from 
drill-bows from Port Clarence, some of them being so lilvc those in the 
collection of the National Museum as to lead me to bel eve that the 
originals used by Mr. Hildebrand and by me were the same, or that 
they were made from copies or duplicates by the same Alaskan artist. 

On plate 9 are represented six pieces of decorated bone slabs 
obtained from the southeastern neighbors of the Eskimo — the Thlinkit 
Indians. The specimens are selected at random from a necklace bear- 
ing a total of fifteen. They were the pro])erty of a shaman and formed 
part of his decorations, but whether they were believed to possess 
mystic or other virtue is not known. 

The interest connected with this lot consists in the decorations upon 
the pieces of smooth bone. The ornamentation is typical of the 
Eskimo, as may be perceived by reference to numerous illustrations 
submitted herewith, and was apparently adopted in imitation of sim- 
ilar designs observed in the possession of Eskimo shamans, or such as 
may have been introduced through the medium of intertribal traffic. 
The trade route along the northwest coast has before been referred to 
as oue of the most interesting culture routes of that part of the Ameri-

call continent, but with an almost total absence of evidence to the con- 
trary, the direction of the movement of culture and art designs has 
been in the opposite direction to that illustrated by the present 
instance. In other words, the Haida and other influences have been 
pushing- steadily northward and westward amongst and beyond the 
territory of the Thlinkit, and not from the latter areas eastward and 
southward. 

By reference to the illustrations in the plate, it will be observed that 
the concentric circles, apparently made in the same manner on all the 
pieces where present, were made by pieces of metal filed to a V-shaped 
form, one apex or side being left a little longer, perhaps, than the other, 
so as to more easily serve as the center pivot. The rings are of differ- 
ent width from the outer, showing that they were not made by an 
instrument with movable arms, in imitation of a pair of dividers. Fur- 
thermore, the diameters are not exactly of the regulation size, as would 
be found in a common manufactured bit, but the outer rings are less 
than one-fourth of an inch in diameter, being almost seven-thirty- 
seconds — an unusual size. The inner circles are scant three- sixteenths 
of an inch in diameter, clearly indicating that the tools were of aborig- 
inal workmanship, though made of imported metals as well as 
imported instruments. 

The arrangement of circles as in fig. 3, plate 9, is also in imitation of 
Aleutian and other Eskimo patterns, and foreign to the ornamentation of 
the Thlinkit, as far, at least, as illustrated in the products of that tribe 
now in the collection of the National Museum. Eeference has already 
been made to a like arrangement of circles on some of the ancient 
British coins, referred to at page 819, and a closely resembling example 
of which is shown in plate 47, fig. 1. 

The strong resemblance between some of the carvings of the Eskimo 
and those of the cave dwellers of the Dordogne has been referred to 
by various authors. 

IMr. Edward T. Stevens remarks that "It is singular that, except at 
La Madelaine, none of the bones appear to have been gnawed by 
beasts of prey." The cave people are believed, therefore, to have 
occupied the caves permanently or to have closed them when deserted, 
and to have excluded carnivorous animals which might otherwise have 
been attracted by the accumulation of bones. 

Doctor A. B. Meyer, director of the Royal Zoological and Anthropo- 
logical Museum in Dresden, has recently published some magnificent 
folio volumes on the ethnographic materials from various localities — 
from the Philippines, ISTew Guinea, etc. — and in Volume ix of the series 
presents some illustrations of combs bearing decorations, which would 
at a cursory glance suggest the type from which the Eskimo orna- 
mentation was obtained for the comb shown in plate 32, fig. 4. The 
several specimens of workmanship of the Nigritos above mentioned 
nuiy be found by reference to Doctor Meyer's plate 2, figs. 1, 2, and 3.

946 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUMy 1895 

Plate 65, fig. 4, is a thread case of reindeer horn, marked as from 
"Ooglaamie." This is interesting, because of the peculiar portraiture 
of reindeer horns, in which these projections are exceedingly tall and 
straight, as compared with the art work of other localities. The most 
interesting figure connected with this is the representation of a kaiak, 
immediately above which are two nucleated rings, exactly like those 
shown in the petroglyphs from Sweden. 

Plate 7, fig. 1, represents an arrow straightener made of reindeer 
antler. The specimen measures 6f inches in length, and is surmounted 
by the outlines of a reindeer's head, the small knobs only indicating 
the rudimentar}^ horns. The eyes are made by the insertion in small 
perforations of three glass beads. The nostrils and mouth, as well as 
the ears and the external meatus, are all very true to nature. 

An incised line extends along the spine from the occiput to within an 
inch of the rear end, and two incised lines, one on either side of the 
neck, run parallel therewith. 

This specimen is very interesting as comparing very favorably with 
some of the specimens figured by Messrs. Lartet and Christj^,^ which 
are found in the cases of Dordogne. 

An exceedingly interesting arrow straightener of walrus ivory is 
shown on the same plate, fig. 2. The reindeer, which is portrayed in 
outline, has the head thrown forward as in rapid running. The legs 
are gathered up close to the body; the ears are indicated by mere 
perforations, while the eyes were originally inlaid, one still retaining a 
plug of dark wood. The perforation in the body — for the insertion of 
spear or arrow points — was made by sawing the spaces between the 
perforations made by drilling, the saw marks yet remaining where the 
angles were formed. 

The perforations in the arrow straighteners in the Museum collection 
are all at an angle of about 20° to 4()ci, so as to permit the inserted 
piece to extend backward toward the longest projection of the straight- 
ener, in order that a sort of V shape is formed, the two ends being thus 
more readily grasped by the one hand, so as to produce stronger and 
more steady pressure than if both hands were used. 

A number of deeply incised and uncolored figures of reindeer are 
engraved over the body of the utensil, and but a single character 
differing therefrom appears to be that of a shaman, shown near the 
point of the perforation, his two arms being extended and his head 
decorated with horn-like projections, as if the result of a ceremonial 
mask. 

The third specimen (fig. 3 on plate 7) also represents an arrow 
straightener, the head end of which ends in the outline of the fore 
quarters of a bear. The eyes are made of two blue beads inserted in 
perforations, and the teeth are indicated by incisions with the graver. 
The fore legs are made to extend downward over the front of the per- 

' Reliquiae Aquitanicae London, 1875, PI. B. XIX, XX. 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 947 

foration so as to give additional streugth to that part. The specimen 
is slightly decorated on one side with the outline of a human being 
with arms extended, a line extending from the head along the middle 
toward the perforation; on one side is the drawing of a wolf, while 
beneath it is a flintlock gun. Upon the other side is the representa- 
tion of a reindeer, with two smaller animal forms incised, Avhile beneath 
the former is the rude portrayal of anotlier flintlock gun, the flint being 
indicated by an unusually strong line projecting from the raised hammer. 

The general outline of these animal forms appears at a first and 
careless glance to be very like the examples figured by Messrs. Lartet 
and Christy, but upon close inspection the difference between the sev- 
eral types becomes more and more apparent. As before intimated, 
if the cave dwellers of France were in such an intellectual status as is 
usually claimed, the artistic work as evidenced in their etchings on 
horn appears vastly superior to that of many peoples far in advance in 
civilization. 

Further discussion on this subject is not deemed appropriate in this 
connection, but will be renewed in a paper the puri)ort of which is 
intended to be an examination of the relative merits of the art work 
of primitive peoples. 

Similarities of design with divers significations, and dissimilar pat- 
terns with like iiurport, occur in all parts of tlie habitable globe, and, 
as before intimated, the concept giving origin to such designs should in 
all instances, where practicable, be sought for among the peoples who 
are the authors thereof. In like manner, it is of the highest importance 
to obtain tlie native artists' interpretation of any obscure or conven- 
tionalized characters, as such are often apparently intelligible from 
their resemblance to characters of known signification, whereas the 
result of inquiry may sometimes be rather startling, if not open to the 
suspicion that the uncultured artist is himself unconsciously in error. 

APPENDIX. 

The following list of gesture signs were collected during the summer 
of 1882 in San Francisco, California, where an intelligent Kadiak half- 
caste was met with under circumstances which enabled him to devote his 
exclusive attention to the subject of the transmission of thought with- 
out the use of oral speech. This person was the ott'spring of a Russian 
father and a Kadiak mother, and during his youth had almost con- 
stantly accompanied his father in trading and collecting peltries for 
the Eussian Fur Company. After the transfer to the United States of 
Alaska, this man, Vladimir IS^aomoff, continued in the service of the 
Alaska Commercial Company, of San Francisco, California, visiting the 
various settlements of natives on the mainland and inland to the Cop- 
l)er River Indians [Kutchin or Kenai], a tribe of the Athabaskan lin- 
guistic family. In this manner Naomoff became thoroughly familiar 
not only with Russian, English, and the Kadiak dialect, but with half

a dozen or more other native dialects, wLich enabled him to observe 
and acquire the various resources which many of the natives, meeting 
as strangers, would be compelled to employ to enable them to commu- 
nicate in ordinary contact, and also in the representation of graphic 
methods whereby to communicate to owners of houses of a visit and 
the import thereof. 

The collecti(m of gestures was made, together with many others, from 
most of the Indian tribes west of the Mississippi Eiver, and deposited 
in the library of the Bureau of Ethnology, through the courtesy of 
which I am enabled to give them publicity in this connection.

shoulders, palm or sides to the front. Then pass the left fist downward, backward, 
and outward toward the left, and in a curve continue upward, forward, and back to 
point of starting, i. e., the right follows the motion of the left, maintaining its dis- 
tance as in commencement. When the left turns up and back on its course, the 
right begins a similar gesture on its side. " Represents the manner of using the 
double-blade oar (or paddle) of the coast natives."' 
Kill, To. Killed. 

Place the right forearm horizontally forward from the elbow, flat hand, ])alm 
downward ; the left flat hand pointing upward and forward from the left side ; then, 
as the right hand is rotated outward and the back down, throw the left palm 
straight across and dowmward over the right forearm. 
Kill, To (with a gun). 

Point the left forefinger ibrward at arm's length, the index pointing in the same 
direction from the right eye; then make the sign for to Jdll, killed.

head; then pass the flat hand, edgewise, out toward the front and right from the 
center of the breast. 
Mother. 

Close the hands, incline the head forward, then pass the hands upward from the 
back of the head, forward, and downward toward the forehead, the motion corre- 
sponding to the curve of the head, but the hands about 3 or 4 inches from it. 
MOTHEK. 

Make the sign for woman, and to be born. 
Mother'.s brother. 

Make the sign mother [i. e. n'omen, to be horn, and mine], then for tall, by indicating 
height with the flat hand palm down; man, by elevating the hand, and that for 
mustache. 
Mother's sister. 

Make the signs for mother [woman, to be horn, and mine^ and younf/ woman ; conclude 
by throwing the fist with the thumb extended in a pointed manner a little to the 
right, indicating hers. 

MUSKRAT. 

Curve the left fingers and thumb and bring the tips almost to a point, leaving a 
slight opening, palm down, and horizontal, finger tips pointing toward the right; 
then bring the extended index pointing from the left side directly toward the left, 
in an upward curve first, then downward and forward into the opening left at the tip 
of the left.

954 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

People. 

Move the elevated index with the palmed surface forward, from side to side, before 
the face. " Men at various places." 

The index is an abbreviation of the general sign for man, and this was the only 
instance in which it was used. 

Porcupine. 

With the palms directed toward and near the ground, imitate slow walking by 
moving them alternately forward and backward ; stoop over to the front, throw the 
separated fingers backward toward the hip, then throw the extended index violently 
outward and backward. 

"Imitates slow movement of the animal, the spiny covering, and the direction 
of the spines thrown from the tail."

Flex both hands, place the outer edges together just before the neck, palms toward 
the face, throw the head back, open the mouth to full extent and imitate the gut- 
tural sound of X or ch twice or three times, at the same time making a downward 
pull with the hands. 
Settlement. 

Indicate a large circle, horizontally, by passing the hands in semicircle, right and 
left, from nearly at arm's length backward to the breast; then place the tips of the 
fingers of both hands together, leaving the hands and forearms leaning outward 
.and downward to their respective sides, the distance between the elbows being about 
24 inches.

SPECIMENS REFERRED TO IN PRESENT PAPER. 

The specimens selected from the collections of the National Museum, 
upon which to base the present paper, are enumerated below, and in 
all instances, where possible, the Kational Museum Catalogue number 
is attached, as well as the nature of the specimen, the locality from 
which obtained, aud the name of the collector. Other information of 
interest as to the character of the etchings engraved therein is also 
added in a few examples. 

The list is divided into two general classes, the former embracing 
the drill bows, bag handles, aud other long rods; while the second 
comprises all other inscribed pieces, such as utensils, weapons, orna- 
ments, toys, and other undetermined specimens. 

The leading word refers to the article under consideration, which is 
followed by the locality where it was obtained. The name of the col- 
lector is next given, which, in turn, is followed by the numbers under 
which it is placed in the accession list of the National Museum. 

The entire series of numbers, from first to last, is in order so as to 
facilitate identification by that means as well as the kind of object 
referred to. 

The list forms but a small part of the collections from Alaska, but is 
sufficiently comprehensive for the present paper.

960 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Drill bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 33181. The bow is curved edgewise, 
plain, with the exception of a heavily incised crease at the base of either side. 
One of these creases shows evidences of repeated scratchings with a liuely 
pointed tool. 

Drill BOW. Norton Sound. E.W. Nelson. 33182. A yellowish, rather old, wjteci- 
men w-ith various figures, nearly all of which are characteristic. 

Drill BOW. Norton Sound. E.W.Nelson. 33183. Afour sided round-edged piece 
of old ivory, 13^ inches in length, upon one side of which only a simple figure 
occurs — that of a man with his arms curved and hands resting on his hips. 

Drill bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 33184. This bears marginal lines 
extending from end to end, at one end being a kaiak with a single hunter, while 
at the other are four inverted umiaks; apparently not a finished drawing. 

Drill bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 33188. Made of reindeer horn, and is 
rather thin and deeply creased on either edge by one groove, and by two grooves 
upon the upper and under sides. The lower side bears sharply incised engrav- 
ings of reindeer hunting; the herd of animals is lying down, while the hunter 
is crawling up on all fours, being hidden by a hillock.

other side are the conventional rear ends of whales, with the flukes projecting. 

Kantag handle. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 37742. Plate 14, fig. 3. 

Drill BOW. Shaktolik. E.W.Nelson. 38521. Bears upon one side nineteen rein- 
deer, no doubt purely for decorative purpose. Upon the opposite side are also 
twelve reindeer, though heading in the opposite direction. These, too, are all 
alike, or nearly so, and appear to be intended rather for decorating the bow than 
as a record only. 

Drill bow. Shaktolik. E. W. Nelson. 38522. Hunter partly obliterated, but 
to his right are five whale flukes setting on end T-shaped and indicating that 
number of whales captured. The opposite side — the bow being made to stand 
edgewise — bears a reindeer which is being shot at by a hunter. The latter is 
lying flat and aiming with a gun. At the other end are three granaries. 

Bag handle. Shaktolik. E. W. Nelson. 38523. Six inches in length and rather 
stout. It is yellow with age, and bears upon the upper side one base line, to

diameter, arranged without any special care or purpose, simply following the 
general horizontal direction of the faces. One edge has whale flukes and the 
other triangular summer habitations in regular order and apparently for dec- 
orative purposes only. 

Drill BOW. Port Clarence. T. H. Bean. 40054. This bow bears hunters spearing 
seals through the ice, some of which are illustrated elsewhere. Upon the other 
side are several figures of mythic animals. Upon one edge is a village of tri- 
angular-shaped dwellings, with meat rack in middle. 

Kantag handle. St. Michaels. E. W. Nelson. 43434. Plate 80, fig. 2. 



GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 961 

Drill bow. Shaktolik. E. W. Nelson. 43810. Delicate and beautiful engraving 
marks this as very superior to most specimens. The reindeer is shown on one 
side; delicately engraved umiaks and a kaiak are on the next adjoining side, 
while on the reveise are partly obliterated characters, shown and described in 
text in figures. 

Kantag handle. Unalakleet. E. W. Nelson. 43820. Plate 58, fig. 3. 

DiULL BOW. Nubuiakhchugaluk. E. W. Nelson. 43931. 

Kantag handle. Nubuiakhchugaluk. E. W. Nelson. 43936. 

Drill bow. Cape Darby. E. AV. Nelson. 44206. Much curved and old specimen. 
The length straight across from point to point is 14 inches, while the height of 
the curve is 4 inches. Both sides are decorated, the narrow edges having only 
parallel lines, excepting one place ornamented with an umiak containing three 
persons The upper side bears a variety of delicately engraved figures, occupied 
with various avocations, and mauy of them represented in attitudes to denote 
action and gesture. The under side bears a herd of reindeer, the animals, after 
passing through a slough or river, approaching a hunter who is armed. Beyond 
this person is another engaged in cutting up a reindeer which is lying upon its 
back. At the right side are four other reindeer in various lifelike attitudes. 

Drill bow. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44207. Bears a few coarsely engraved 
characters, at one end being the upper line of a whale's figure, to which are 
attached lines like fins or spines from the head down toward and nearly touch- 
ing the flukes. 

Drill bow. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44208. Walrus hunting and scaffolded 
umiaks are shown on one of the two lower surfaces, the upper flat surface being 
without any engravings. The work is very graphic, and some of the boats in 
the water are scattered, to resemble the work of .Japanese artists — as pertains to 
an attempt at perspective in this instance. The specimen is shown as a test 
figure. 

Drill bow. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44209. Plate 24, fig. 1. 

Drill bow. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44210. Records on two sides consist 
almost entirely of reindeer in various attitudes, and some very lifelike. A few 
animals are drawn foreshortened. 

Drill BOW. Cape Darbj". E.W. Nelson. 44212. Old yellow ivory specimen, deco- 
rated on four faces. The dorsal surface has two figures incised to the depth of 
over one-sixteenth of an inch, the figures consisting of rudely drawn animals 
and human beings. 

At the side is a series of outlines of the human figure, with arms in various 
attitudes, as in records portraying ceremonial dances, though in the present 
instance the figures appear seated upon the ground, or base line. Boats and 
walruses are also to be seen nearer the right end, while at the left is a seal hunt. 
Upon the opposite side are several umiaks, going toward the right, in pursuit 
of a whale. In the middle of the record are some indefinite outlines, among 
which, however, may be detected that of a reindeer. 

The under side bears upon it a number of animal forms at the left, while a 
well-drawn whale is next portrayed, followed by another, whose body is thrown 
partly from the Avater, having been liarpooned by a hunter in the pursuing umiak 
at the right. A whale fluke projects from the water behind the boat, while two 
cubs and an adult bear are next shown, approaching three large figures, which 
seem to be intended for heavily robed or dressed natives. 

Drill bow. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44213. Upon the dorsum of this piece 
is a group of ships and native boats. Rude engravings of ships occur on one 
side, while white men's houses are represented at other iiortions. 

Drill bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 44366. Delicate and sharp engraving 
marks this specimen as characteristic of this locality. 
The herd of deer shown in fig. 9 are from this piece.

unusually interesting, the spear rack or guard being indicated in the first kaiak, 
while on the second the harpoon line is shown with the twists and curves observ- 
able when a coiled line is cast out. 
Drill bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 44401. Plate [23], fig. 1. 
Drill BOW. Cape Nome. (E.W.Nelson.?) 41464. Interesting from the fact that 
both slopes of the under surface bear row.s of umiaks, some with meats and some 
without, so placed as to suggest ornamentation rather than an attemi)t to record 
historic or other information. 

Upon the upper side the entire length is also divided by a median line. Upon 
either side the space is filled with various figures, such as camp scenes, dances, 
and various avocations.

Bag handle. Sledge Island. E.W.Nelson. 44691. 

Bag handle. Sledge Island. E. W. Nelson. 44716. Measures but 5| inches in 
length, and bears upon the top some conventional " trident " tree figures, each 
placed alternately faoing, between parallel longitudinal lines. 
Kantag handle. Sledge Island. E.W.Nelson. 44717. 

Drill bow. Sledge Island. E.W.Nelson. 45016. Parts of this are reproduced 
in text figure. The lines are sharp and cleanly incised. One pecularity in the 
figures of human beings on records from Sledge Island is that the heads are all, 
or nearly all, made by boring with drill. One side of another face l>ears an 
umiak with harpooned whale, following a neatly engraved white umi;ik con- 
taining 3 figures. 

The under side bears some obscene figures, or rather those made obscene by 
gesture and additional drawings. 
Drill bow. Sledge Island. E. W. Nelson. 45017. The figures of a series of hab- 
itations, boats on racks, and umiaks afloat, are all neatly and definitely incised. 
Upon the reverse is a settlement of two winter hai)itations and one scaffold, 
the five human figures being portrayed with hands and arms elevated, slightly 
inclined toward the left end of the bow, seemingly as if some further portion of 
a record had been contemplated but not executed. The color employed in fill- 
ing the incision is black, and the entire si)ecimen, and engravings, has a modern 
appearance.

Diiirx BOW OF iiOKN. Sledge Island. E.W.Nelson. 45018. 

Drill bow. Sledge Island. E. W. Nelson (?). 45019. The decorations on this 
interesting specimen are reprodnced in text figure. The work is characteristic, 
the dancers only resembling the deeply engraved figures usually found on the 
specimens from Kotzebue Sound. 

Dkill bow. Sledge Island. E. W. Nelson. 45020. This old specimen presents a 
whaling fleet. Upon the reverse is a group of natives fishing through the ice, 
near by being their residence, granary, and votive offerings stuck up upon the 
entrance to the house. 

Dhill bow. Sledge Island. E. W. Nelson. 45025. Upper side slightly rounded, 
while the bottom is divided in two sides or faces. All these are decorated -with 
sharp, fine lines, characteristic of Cape Nome workmanship. The specimen is 
very yellow and has an old appearance, chiefly because of the signs of long- 
continued use. 

Kantag handlk. Sledge Island. E. W. Nelson. 45154. 

Drill bow. Ca])e Nome. E.W.Nelson. 45330. 

Drill bow. Cape Nome. E.W.Nelson. 45331. An old piece of ivory with char- 
acteristic engravings. The type is recognized, if any special difference may be 
said to exist between this and other localities, by the thin, though sharply 
incised, lines and brown-black color applied to bring out the cavities. A great 
deal of gesticulation is always represented in connection with the portrayal of 
the human figiire. 

One of the two upper faces has upon it a herd of reindeer, the other face a seal 
hunt, while the bottom has the drawings of buildings and storehouses for food. 

Drill BOAV. Cape Nome. E.W.Nelson. 45332. A triangular slightly curved bow, 
17i inches in length. The spbcimerT is yellow from age and bears the delicate 
hair-like incisions or engravings characteristic of the locality from which it 
came. Gestures are frequently indicated, though the chief features of the bow 
refer to reindeer and walrus hunting. At one end is a dance, the performers 
being drawn in various attitudes. 

On the under side are the fine lines portraying two kaiaks ap]troaching one 
another, the occupants holding aloft their paddles, while between them are two 
seals. A little farther toward one side is an umiak with five occupants, whose 
heads and faces resemble birds' heads with long sharp bills. 

Drill bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 45333. 

Drill bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 45345. Beais herds of reindeer, some 
browsing, while others are in various attitudes upon the ground. The under 
side bears a herd of reindeer approaching a himter. At the right end are two 
bears, apparently a mother with its cub. 

Drill bow. Cajie Nome. E. W. Nelson. 45346. Some of these etchings embody 
gesture signs, and are reproduced in connection with that subject. 

Drill bow. Port Clarence. W. H.Dall. 46056. Made of a rib, is almost 12 inches 
across from tip to tij), antl retains a thong of leather for drilling pur])oses. 
There are no decorations of any description. 

Drill bow. Fort Anderson. R. MacFarlane. A rounded bow 11^ inches long, 
resembling the preceding in smoothness and absence of decoration. 

Drill bow. Golovin Bay. E. W. Nelson. 48080. A specimen yellow with age. 
No decorations ajjpear with the exception of two parallel lines on both the upper 
and lower surfaces. The handle has been much worn by long-continued use. 

Drill BOW. Cape Darby. E.W.Nelson. 48115. An old-looking yellow specimen, 
iipon which is the whale being dragged from the water and cut up, shown in 
plate 67, fig. 3. 

The opposite side has the ceremonial dance, and drummer from whose instru- 
ment the sound is represented as going out over the group of dancers. Plate 
72, fig. 2,

964 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Drill bow. Kotzehne Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48518. A dark yellow specimen, 
crudely and heavily engraved with ship, walrus, etc. A good harpoon line and 
eflect of cast is shown. 
Drill bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 48330. Bears solid herd of reindeer 
nearly 3 inches long, while on other side are reindeer, and men making gestures 
Drill bow. Kotzebue Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48519. An old and very yellow 
specimen of ivory. Four sides of the piece are decorated with several distinct 
styles of records. The upper or convex side hears the deeply engraved figures 
of whaling ships foreshortened, and habitations, probably indicating some 
trader's establishment. On one side is a native, drawn lengthwise, next to him 
being portrayed a rack with meat (fish) suspended, while next to this is a net 
stretched out for drying. 

The next characters resemble the curved parallel lines used by the Pueblo 
tribes and the Ojibwa to denote the sky, beneath which are parallel vertical 
lines running down to the base or ground line, resembling the symbol for rain. 
The present figures are believed, however, to denote the aurora borealis, a like 
figure having been drawn for the present writer by Naomoff and verified by a 
Malamut Eskimo in California at the same time when the investigations were 
made at the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company. 

A verv rudely drawn figure of a winter habitation, with smoke issuing from 
tlie top, is shown next toward the right, the end of the rod bearing smaller fig- 
ures of food rack, huts, etc. 

The under side of the rod bears, at the left, two dog sledges being dragged 
forward, and preceded by nine natives running toward a large winter habita- 
tion. These natives are in various attitudes to represent locomotion, and each 
has a projection upon the head, as if ornamented with a plume, though it may 
represent the top of tlie furred hood. 

The engraving is generally deep, and characteristic of the locality from whence 
it was obtained.

Drill BOW. Kotzebue Sound. E.W.Nelson. 48521. 

Drill bow. Kotzebue Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48522. A dark yellow specimen, 
apparently very old, and engraved on three sides. Figs. — are from this piece. 
All the engravings are deeply cut and blackened. One side bears 15 seals, 14 of 
which are being dragged, the entire series resembling an attempt at decorative 
results rather than historic. 
Drill bow. Kotzebue Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48524. 

Drill BO^\^ Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48.525. This bow is tinged with age, 
and is of a decided orange along one side. Parts of the engravings, which cover 
the four sides, have been reproduced in plate 22, fig. 3. Many parts of some of 
the engravings have become so worn by long-continued use as to be too indistinct 
to admit of interpretation. The figures are, on the whole, rather deeply and 
boldly incised, and show a marked likeness to the rest of the work from the 
locality where it was evidently made. 

The coloring matter in the incisions has assumed a deep brown color, as if the 
original black had become covered or replaced by dirt or grease. 
Drill bow. Kotzebue Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48526. Very deep and strong 

engravings on old ivory. 
Drill, or handle. Kotzebue Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48527. This old stained 
piece bears upon the two upper sides a number of animal forms, one row being 
a series of six reindeer, together with several seals and whales. A native in his 
kaiak is represented with his arms uplifted, and probably the fingers were drawn 
spread, use of specimen having worn the surface smooth. 

One underside has a long row of ten wolves and one reindeer, faced by a 
hunter shooting an arrow, who is accompanied by two other hunters and a dog. 
The other side shows a whale hunt and a walrus and bear hunt, the two hunt- 
ing scenes being divided by a narrow vertical line bearing delicate cross- 
hatchings, and denotes the partition of the two.

Work bag fastener. Sabotniaky. E. W. Nelson. 48966. Made of a three-sided 
piece of ivory in which the corners have been rounded and smoothed. The 
ornamentations are sets of cross-lines, to the center of which are short lateral 
lines, and between each such transverse set are small black spots and crosses. 

Drill BOW. Hotham Inlet. E.W.Nelson. 64153. Apiece originally almost sqnare, 
but by perforating at the ends, from beneath, the specimen was split vertically. 
Both sides are ornamented, however, one side with but a few scratches, while 
the other has a very interesting whale and walrus hunt. 

Drill bow. Hotham Inlet. E. W. Nelson. 641.52. An old specimen with four 
sides crudely engraved. Shooting with firearms, dragging seals, etc., comprises 
the subjects portrayed. Three whale's flukes are also erected, to denote that 
animal, while a dog sledge, with very rude drawing of the dog. 

Drill bow. Diomede Island. E. W. Nelson. 63621. Only 9 inches long and 
averages one-fourth of an inch square; yet the four sides are ornamented; 
three have lateral longitudinal border lines, between which are recorded numer- 
ous figures of umiaks after walrus and a ceremonial dance with one drummer. 
On another side is a village, showing ijummer habitations or conical houses, 
near meat racks, some boats, etc. The under side bears several animal forms, 
and two mythic figures resembling the water monster, i. e., an elongated four- 
footed and horned or crested serpent, referred to by Naomoti' in connection with 
fig. 139, c. 

Drill bow. Diomede Island. E. W. Nelson. 63623. Dark yellow or light brown 
piece of ivory. The four engraved sides are shown in text figures. 

Kantag HANDLE. Poiut Hopc. E. W. Nelson. 63801. 

Drill BOW. Point Hope. E.W.Nelson. 63802. Very crude though deeply incised 
line, composing animals, etc., is shown on rather white ivory. An interesting 
whale hunt is shown ; the flukes appear like detached decorative ones, attached 
to the rear end of bodies. 

Flukes are also shown at one place; while a native crawling along on his 
stomach, to approach seals, is also engraved. 
Upon the top edge are four birds, four difl'ereut forms of representing them. 

Bag HANDLE. Point Hope. E.W.Nelson. 63803. The undersurface of this stained 
old specimen bears the figures of eleven outstretched hides, at the right being 
a human figure. Upon the top face is some linear decoration, while near the 
middle of the specimen are figures of four reindeer, facing to the right. Portions 
of the figures are without the brown-black stain, the legs being slender and 
the hoofs indicated by minute etchings made by a sharp-pointed graver. 

Upon the outer curve are a number of nucleated rings, 33 in number, and 
each three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter. The under side bears a median 
line, upon which are portrayed, in various attitudes, nine reindeer. The figures 
are rather deeply incised and very black. The coloring matter in several jilaces 
has fallen out, as if it had become hard or dry. 

Bag HANDLE. Point Hope. E.W.Nelson. 63809. 

Bow OR HANDLE. "Chilcat." J. J. McLean. 67904. An almost square, slightly 
curved specimen, with engravings on all sides excepting the under or concave 
one. The top or convex surface bears, among other objects, a large umiak, the 
four occupants of which are indicated by the heads, arms, and paddles only, the 
vertical body line being jmrposely omitted or forgotten. Some conventional 
trees are used as ornamental markings. The sides bear seal hunts, and most of 
the records have been reproduced in the text. 



966 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Each side is ornamented by two deeply incised grooves, one at either edge of 
the faces of the bow, and the engravings are deeply and forcibly made, all being 
filled in with black. 

Though marked as from "Chilcat," the specimen has the characteristic appear- 
ance of the work done by the natives of Norton Sonnd. 

Bag handle. Point Barrow. Lieutenant P. H. Ray, U. S. A. 89420. Measures 
14| inches in length, the upper surface being rather flat, while the under side is 
rounded or convex. Upon the upi)er surface are twelve reindeer, one behind the 
other and facing the left, while at the extreme right is a man holding a bow 
drawn^ but no arrow indicated; while at the extreme right is a tigure resembling 
an outstretched bearskin. The engravings are strongly incised and greatly 
resemble those made at Norton Sound and Kotzebue Sound. There is no coloring 
matter in any place, and it is believed that the work was not made by Point 
Barrow natives, but secured by them by traffic or otherwise from some locality 
farther south and west than Point Barrow. 

The arrangement of the reindeer, the apparent similarity in all respects, and 
their regular spacing — between the figures — suggests that, although the record 
seems to be intended for a hunting score, it was also made with a view to pre- 
senting an ornamental and decorative appearance.

Bone drill bow. Point Barrow. Lieutenant P. H. Ray, U. S. A. 89508. Made of 
a rib, measures 12^ inches across from point to point, and is rather rudely made. 
Bears no decoration. 

Drill bow. Point Barrow. Lieutenant P. H. Ray, U. S. A. 89777. Bears a ver- 
tical line with radiating lines from one side only. The ivory is pieced near one 
end to lengthen the bow; the coloring matter is pale, but consisted of a reddish 
substance resembling red ocher. 

Drill BOW. St. Michaels. L.M.Turner. 129223. Ornamented on lower side by a 
"solid" herd of reindeer, wolves, seals, walrus, and other animals. The inci- 
sions are deeply cut and are left nncolored, appearing light yellowish gray as 
compared with the dark surrounding surface. Made of reindeer horn. 

Drill bow. Location not given. M. M. Ilazen. 15J071. Whaling ships in pur- 
suit of whales and a walrus. An Innuit village is at the right. On the other 
side are very deeply engraved figures of habitations, umiaks on scafiold, etc. 
The character of work resembles that of Kotzebue Sonnd. 

MISCELLANEOUS AND VARIED SPECIMENS. 

The following are miscellaneous specimens, embracing tools, imple- 
ments, utensils, toys, etc., all of which are variously marked with etch- 
ings of animals, villages, occupations, and in many instances only with 
lines, dots, and circles, to illustrate the application of such figures for 
the purpose of simple ornamentation.

NOTES ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OE THE 
PENINSULA OE LOWER CALIEORNIA. 



By George P. Merrill, 
Curator, Department of Geology, U. S. National Museum. 



During tlie summer of 1892 tlie writer had occasion to pay a brief 
visit to the peninsula of Lower Cahfornia, going by boat from San Diego 
to Sau Quentin, and thence by wagon and pack train to EI Rosario and 
across to within a few miles of the Gulf Coast, the route lying approxi- 
mately along the line of the thirtieth parallel. The trip was hurriedly 
made with the scanty equipments furnished by a prospector's outfit, 
and opi^ortunities for detailed work were quite lacking. The resultant 
geological observations have already found their way into print, but a 
brief abstract from the original publication' may well be given here. 
The excuse for the present paper lies in the fact that the region, aside 
from being comparatively unknown and difficult of access, presents 
many features of interest from the standpoint of both naturalist and 
archaeologist. 

Fortunately the writer carried with him a folding kodak, and though 
the good work done by the instrument was in some degree undone by the 
carelessness or ignorance of a professional photographer in San Diego, 
enough remains to give, with the aid of a little touching up, the views 
here shown. In the pages following the remarks on the physiography 
and geology of the region are (]uoted from the paper above mentioned. 
The itinerary is compiled from memoranda made at the time. 

(1) PHYSIOGRAPHY. 

"The peninsula of Baja California is a narrow strip of broken moun- 
tainous laud extending roughly from 22° 50' to 32° 30' north latitude, 
about 775 miles long and from 35 to 70 miles in width, with a general 
northwest and sontheast trend parallel to the larger orographic features 
of the Pacific Slope. Its coast outline, characterized as it is at many

points by xong sweeps or reentering- curves, with outlying islands and 
l)rqjecting- points partly inclosing oval, valley-like basins, is at once 
suggestive of a partially submerged series of mountain chains. 

"The peninsula is divided by Gabb ^ into three geographical provinces : 
A southern, extending from Cape St. Lucas to beyond La Paz, char- 
acterized by irregular granite mountain chains up to 5,000 feet in 
height, and with deep valleys containing considerable fertile arable 
land; an intermediate desert region, characterized by table-lauds and 
flat-topped ridges, with a considerable extent of interior valleys, and 
with isolated mountain tops and ranges projecting above the general 
mesa level, which rarely reach an elevation of more than 3,000 to 4,000 
feet. This region has no running water and springs are very scarce; a 
high northern portion from 5,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level forming 
a southern continuation of the mountain region of southern California, 
which has a number of running streams and large valleys susceptible 
of cultivation, while the higher portions contain considerable extents 
of pine forests. 

"The limits of these three provinces are not sharply defined, but may 
be taken at about I'OO miles in longitudinal extent for the northern, 450 
miles for the intermediate desert region, and 100 miles for the southern." 

"While from a first glance at existing maps it might appear that the 
depressions of the Mohave and Colorado deserts and of the Gulf of 
California were the normal southern extensions of the great depression 
of the San Juan and Sacramento valleys, and that the Peninsula range 
was therefore the normal southern continuation of the coast range, 
there is some reason to be found in its topographical form, and still 
more, as will be seen later, in its geological structure, for the assumption 
that the peninsula more properly represents the southern extension of 
the Sierra Nevada uplift. On this assumption the connection between 
the two would be aflbrded by the various en echelon ranges known as 
San Jacinto Mountains, San Bernardino Mountains, etc., lying to the 
northward, while the southern extension of the Coast range proj^er, cut 
off' by the reentering angle of the coast between Santa Barbara and 
Los Angeles, would be represented by the chain of islands, Santa 
Cataliua, San Clemente, etc., generally known as the Channel Islands, 
lying off' the coast between Los Angeles and San Diego. 

"To the south of San Diego the mountains come down to the sea and 
the mesa disappears, being only represented by an occasional patch of 
later beds which have escaped erosion, as at Sausal and Todos Santos, 
GO miles south of the boundary. At Cape Colnett, in latitude 31°, a 
strip of mesa forms the immediate coast and widens southward toward 
San Quentin, in latitude 30° 30', which is assumed to be about the limit 
of the northern or mountainous province. From San Quentin south-

ward, as far as examined by the writers, the mesa structure is charac- 
teristic of the Pacific Coast, the table lands rising to a height of 1,000 
to 2,000 feet at comparatively short distances from the sea, and pre- 
senting bold bluffs of soft horizontally stratified beds, often capped by 
lava flows, which are evidently wearing away rapidly under the erosive 
action of waves. 

"Lindgren, as a result of his observations in the vicinity of Ensenada 
de Todos Santos, divides the topographic features of the peninsula 
Sierra into three sections:^ 

(1) The coast range, rising gradually from the sea to an elevation of 
3,000 feet in a distance of 20 to 30 miles. Surmounting this area several 
minor ranges and sharp peaks attaining an elevation of 3,000 to 4,000 
feet. A rapid descent leads from the divide of the coast range to — 

(2) The interior valleys, an interrupted series of depressions in the 
middle of the chain at an elevation of 1,800 to 2,000 feet. 

(3) The eastern range, rising rapidly from the valleys and continuing 
as an almost level plateau, with a gentle slope up to the peninsular 
divide and an abrupt, almost precipitous, descent to the desert. The 
elevation of this remarkable plateau is from 4,000 to 5,000 feet. 

"This plateau region, which supports a considerable growth of pine 
forest, extends, according to the meager accounts obtainable, from the 
boundary southward about to latitude 31°, reaching its culminating 
point in the high mountain mass now known as San Pedro de Martis, 
which is apparently the same as the snow-capped mountain called in 
the Narragansett report " Oalamahue," or Santa Oatalina (Caterina) 
Mountain. 

"The area examined by the present writers, which extends 15 to 30 min- 
utes north and south of the thirtieth parallel of latitude, is separated by 
a considerable gap of unknown country from that described by Lindgren. 
In this latitude the average elevation of the peninsula is about 2,000 
feet, and that of its higher ridges may be taken at less than 3,500 feet. 
It is a singularly arid region, having practically no running water on 
the surface and very few permanent springs; nevertheless our experi- 
ence has shown that properly located wells obtain a fair supply of 
water at depths of 20 to GO feet. The climate is remarkably equable 
and healthful, being but little warmer than that of the coast region of 
southern California, and as a rule much drier. The diurnal changes 
of temperature are, however, very great. It is swept by continuous 
breezes from either coast, which appear to blow alternately about three 
days at a time, those from the Pacific being laden with more or less 
moisture, while the east winds are extremely dry. Like California, it 
has a rainy season in the spring, but this is generally but a few days' 
duration and extremelj^ irregular and uncertain."

" This whole region may be iu one sense considered to be a mesa region, 
since at one time the present mesa formation extended from coast to 
coast, but at the present day the mesas are no longer continuous, and 
erosion has disclosed an underlying or buried topography, whose 
genera] features show considerable analogy with the more northern 
region described by Lindgren. The mesa belt proper adjoining the 
western coast is represented by a series of plateaus from 900 to 2,000 
feet in elevation, separated by the deep canyon-like valleys of streams 
that drain the interior. Owing to the soft, crumbling nature of the 
beds, the escarpments are very abrupt, and the topography has some- 
thing of the character of the Bad l^ands of the Great Plains. 

<'The coast or western range is represented by a series of isolated 
peaks or ridges rising 1,000 or 2,000 feet above the general mesa level, 
which are partly connected together by flat-topped ridges base-leveled 
down to the average elevation of the highest portion of the mesa 
region, but which in geological structure and composition belong to the 
same system of uplift as the higher peaks. 

"East of this range lie the interior valleys, broad, level, or gently 
sloping plains 10 to 15 miles in Avidth and with an elevation above 
sea level of 1,800 to 2,200 feet, bounded and traversed by mesa-topped 
ridges and with occasional sharp peaks rising out of them. These 
interior valleys all drain to the Pacific through gaps in the western 
range and rise gently to the eastward, the same gentle westward slope 
being noticeable in the mesa-topped ridges. 

"On the eastern edge of these valleys, at a distance of about 10 to 15 
miles from the Gulf Coast, a most sudden change in topographical 
structure takes place. The broad, level plains, in which the drainage 
courses are so shallow that their direction of drainage is with difficulty 
recognizable, give place to deep, narrow, tortuous ravines, descending 
a thousand or more feet within a few miles of the mesa-topped divide. 
These ravines wind along a series of sharp Jagged peaks, which evi- 
dently are the projecting summits of an older and partially buried 
mountain chain. The eastern range is represented in part by the sum- 
mits of this buried range, in part by a series of isolated table-topped 
mountains rising to an elevation of 3,500 feet, which brings them above 
the summits of most of the sharper peaks to the eastward. On the 
immediate Gulf Coast is a gently sloping mesa, of varying width, at 
the base of the eastern range. To the south of the region visited, the 
buried mountains rise still higher than these table topped mountains 
and send out spurs to the westward, which apparently cut off the 
interior valley in that direction. To the north they do not rise above 
the level of the interior valley, and the mesa-topped ridges sweep over 
them, descending in a series of terraces or steps to the Gulf Coast. 

"The rocks, of whicli this eastern buried range is composed, outcrop 
so frequently in tlie bottom of the interior valley that it is probable 
that this valley rests in part upon a plateau-like shoulder of the buried

range, and that its form was not unlike that of the granite plateau 
described by Lindgren in the latitude of Ensenada. 

"From Gabb's description it would appear that a similar topograph- 
ical structure obtains for the part of the peninsula stretching south 
from latitude 29° to La Paz. The eastern range has for the most part 
a mesa-topped crest, broken here and there by projecting ridges, which 
stretch in part across the peninsula and separate the interior valleys. 
The interior valleys, set oft" successively a little more to the southward 
and Avestward, become more extensive southward, one being described 
as stretching from La Purissima to Todos Santos (of the south), a dis- 
tance of 150 to 200 miles, with an average width of 10 miles. The. 
western range is aiDparently still more indistinct as a topographical 
feature and is not recognized by him, but the western mesa region is 
spoken of as stretching in varying width from Magdalena Bay, in lati- 
tude 240 30', to Cape Colnett, in latitude 31°." 

(2) GEOLOGY. 

"For purposes of geological description the region examined maybe 
divided into the coast or mesa belt, the western range, the interior val- 
ley, and the eastern range. The immediate Gulf Coast was not visited." 
On Plate 1^ is given a generalized section across the peninsula along 
the line A-B. Topographical features at some distance from this line 
are brought in to illustrate the general structure.. Though not drawn 
to scale, care has been taken to make the section as close an approxi- 
mation to nature as the data would admit. Distances were estimated 
in traveling to and fro and checked by rough triangulations made with 
a prismatic compass. The vertical scale is intended to be about four 
times larger than the horizontal. 

COAST OR MESA BELT. 

"This area has an average width of 10 to 15 miles, and in it, so far as 
observed, no older rocks occur than horizontally bedded, loosely aggre- 
gated clayey sands, sandstones, and conglomerates, of which the lowest 
horizons carry characteristic forms of the Chico Cretaceous. In a 
higher horizon of this apparently conformable series a characteristic 
fauna of the Tejon-Eocene has been found, and in still higher beds a 
few forms of probable Miocene age were observed. None of these beds 
show evidence of any considerable disturbance, though in a few 
instances dips of 10 to 15 degrees and slight displacements with a throw 
of only a few feet have been observed. They have, however, been exten- 
sively eroded, and later deposits of post-Pliocene and possibly also of 
Pliocene age have been deposited upon their eroded surface. Recent 
eruptive rocks, both acid and basic, have cut through them and in 
places have been important factors in shaping topographical forms by 
protecting the softer beds from erosion.

976 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

"The oest exposures of the lower beds were found between Canoas 
and Bluff points [Plate 1,] where they present perpendicular bluffs, 
facing the sea, from a few hundred up to nearly a thousand feet in 
height. These are being rapidly undermined and eaten back by the 
action of the waves, so that between the two points the coast line forms 
a bow-like reentering curve, set back 3 to 5 miles from a line drawn 
between the points. From either point the land lises in a series of 
steps or broken terraces to an extensive plateau, cut on the sea faces 
by short, narrow, branching ravines aud presenting in general contin- 
uous bluff faces inland. 

"Midway in the reentering curve between Canoas and Bluff points is 
the Playa Santa Caterina, where is a gap a mile or two in width between 
the bluffs bordering the ocean, formed by a broad valley in which are 
two modern stream beds draining the interior region. They are divided 
at the shore line by a flat-topped ridge of Chico beds, near the top of 
which is the remnant of an ancient stream bed whose bottom is now 
about 100 feet above tide water, and which is filled by a conglomerate 
of large bowlders aud water- worn pebbles of massive rocks. This con- 
glomerate, which is cemented by lime and iron, is so much more resist- 
ing than the soft clays of the Chico formation that the huge bowlders 
that fall as the cliff is undermined by wave action form a point pro- 
jecting out several hundred feet beyond the average coast line. These 
conglomerates are probably of the same age as those which are found 
at various points in the canyons of the interior, and their formation 
evidently dates back to a time when, after the carving out of the gen- 
eral system of modern drainage, the waters of the ocean reached a 
higher level than the present, and the old drainage channels were par- 
tially filled up to the then base level. Subsequent erosion, while cut- 
ting down to a somewhat lower level and following the same general 
lines, has often eaten more readily into the softer beds at the sides of 
these recent conglomerates and left patches of them still standing, 
which sometimes form one wall of the canyon a hundred or more feet 
above its present bottom. 

"The modern stream beds from Playa Santa Caterina are almost at 
base level for some 10 miles inland, at about which distance eruptive 
rocks appear from under the Cretaceous and recent beds, and then rise 
rapidly, reaching an elevation of about 1,500 feet within 15 miles of the 
coast, on the partly buried slopes of the coast range. 

"Both in the broad valley and on the mesa slopes are relics of terraces 
which evidence a successive rising of the land above the ocean. 

"The lower beds exposed in the bluffs along the coast have a gentle 
inclination northward and southward from Sandstone Point, about 3 
miles north of Playa Santa Caterina, where massive sandstones form a 
slightly projecting headland. In these sandstones carbonized plant 
remains, too indefinite for identification, were found, and in the cracks of 
the immediately overlying sandy clays were traces of petroleum. From

these beds and from calcareous layers about 200 feet above were 
obtained the following forms, as determined by T. W. Stanton : 

Area breweriana, Gabb. Inoceramus, sp. undetermined. 

Baculites chicoensis, Trask, Ammonites, sp. undetermined. 

Tessarolax distorta, Gabb. Ostrea, sp. undetermined. 

" They correspond with forms found in the Chico beds of California 
and Oregon. 

" From rolled pebbles of impure limestone obtained along the beach 
to the south of the Playa, which had evidently fallen from the cliffs 
above, and from a bed of similar composition in place at what was 
assumed to be about 1,200 feet higher in horizon, at San Carlos anchor- 
age (collected by A. D. Foote), 8 miles north of Bluff Point, the 
following forms were identified by T. W. Stanton: 

Cardita planicostata, Lam. Tellina, sp. undetermined. 

Leda gnbbi, Conrad. Turritella, sp. undetermined. 

Urosyca caudata, Gabb. Dentalium, sp. undetermined. 

Nucula, sp. undetermined. Crassatella, sp. undetermined. 

and are considered by him to belong undoubtedly to the Tejon Eocene. 

"The beds carrying Chico and Tejon fossils were not observed in 
direct superposition, but from the negative evidence that no decided 
unconformities were detected at any of the points examined, it is 
assumed that the two series are conformable, or that in any case no 
considerable disturbance of the strata took place between the times of 
their respective depositions. 

"The great mesa or plateau, 15 miles long and 6 to 8 miles in width, 
which extends from the valley of Santa Caterina northward beyond 
San Carlos, has an elevation of from 1,800 to 2,000 feet, being some- 
what higher ^t the northern end. The greater part of its surface is 
apparently capped by basalt flows, which have protected it from 
erosion. From a distance can be distinguished conical points rising 
above tlie level of the mesa, known as the " Sombrero," the "Hat," etc., 
which resemble recent craters in general form. At one point on the 
coast, fragments of the basalt, cemented together by crystalline calcite, 
have fallen to the foot of the bluff in huge masses and form a projecting 
point on the coast line. 

"For about a mile beyond Sandstone Point the beach is covered with 
beautifully rounded pebbles of porphyries and a great variety of hard 
rocks, mostly older eruptive, whose material must have come down a 
ravine which drains the western face of the plateau and descends 
very rapidly from its summit. As no such j^ebbles were observed in 
the Chico or Tejon series, nor on the beaches to the south where no 
upper beds remain, it is thought probable that the mesa sandstones, 
which are characterized by an abundance of eruptive material, may 
form the upper portion of this plateau. 

"Northward from San Carlos, as seen from the ocean or from com- 
manding points of view in the interior, the same character of beds,

with their cliaracteristic bad-land topography, extend northward to 
the Rosario Raviue. 

"The hamlet of Rosario is situated a few miles from the sea, in this 
ravine or canyon, which extends inland for some 10 or 15 miles with 
very gradual rise of its beds, and carries a small stream of running 
water that in dry seasons sinks below the surface sands. [Plate 2.] 

"The cliffs of the canyon walls are eroded into castellated forms that 
recall the buttes at Green River, Wyoming, familiar to travelers on 
the Union Pacific Railroad. Opposite Rosario the bedding planes have 
a dip of 15 degrees to the northeastward, while the surface of the mesa 
is quite horizontal, and from the pebbles and recent shells on its sur- 
face evidently represents a higher level of the ocean waters, which have 
base-leveled it at about 1,000 feet above present sea level. For a few 
miles north of the mouth of the Rosario Canyon the bluffs come close 
to the present coast line and then gradually retreat, until opposite San 
Quentiu they are about 8 miles inland. The immediate shore is first a 
terrace about 200 feet above the sea level, then at the mouth of the 
Socorro Valley a triangular-shaped Quaternary delta hardly 50 feet 
above sea level, covered with rolled pebbles and recent marine shells. 
The older beds forming the mesa region in this latitude, though not 
markedly different from those between Bluff' and Canoas points, contain 
a larger proportion of conglomerate material and several fossiliferous 
beds of recent looking shells, among which were recognized Mytilus 
californianus and a fragment of Pecten, like P. cerrosensis, which Dr. 
W. H. Dall regards as indicating a probable Miocene age. These are 
the beds seen by Gabb on his trip and called by him "mesa sandstones." 
No evidence of unconformity between these and the Tejon beds was 
observed, and it seems probable that they may constitute the highest 
part of the mesa at Bluff' Point, but this was not determined by fossil 
evidence. 

"Northward from Socorro River the bluffs of the mesa formation 
retreat gradually from the ocean, and at San Quentin are separated 
from it bythe sandy plains of Santa Maria, about 8 miles wide and 
but a few feet above sea level, which are the northern continuation of 
the depressions of the bay of San Quentin. The immediate coast line 
at San Quentin is formed by a group of six conical hills of basalt, from 
400 to 800 feet higTi, which, judging from the uneroded character of the 
lava flows which have issued from their flanks, must be of very recent 
eruption. One of these flows extending southward about 7 miles forms 
the low, narrow tongue of land known as Cape San Quentin. It is evi- 
dently the superior resistance of these hard lavas that has thus far 
protected the plains of Santa Maria from the encroachments of the sea. 

WESTERN RANGE. 

" In the present topography the western range is very ill defined, and 
consists of a number of irregular ridges and isolated mountain masses 
15 to 20 miles from the coast, the highest summits of which are probably

less than 4,000 feet above sea level. Between the peaks are broad, 
transverse valleys and flat-topped ridges whose higher summits have 
the same general level with tliose of the higher plateaus of the mesa 
region — that is, about 2,000 feet. Eounded pebbles and an occasional 
fragment of recent shells were found on these summits, which 
strengthen the opinion that this was a peneplain of recent times, 
probably formed at the time of the greatest submergence since the 
deposition of the mesa sandstones. 

" The range was traversed on two lines — that of the arroyo of Santa 
Caterina, shown in the section [Plate 1], and that of the Rosario arroyo. 
The river bed or arroyo of San Fernando crosses it about midway 
between these two. Near the mission of San Fernando is a consider- 
able development of sedimentary beds, one of which is a much altered 
bluish limestone containing unrecognizable fossils, which is probably 
either of early Mesozoic or Paleozoic age. [Plate 3.J The beds have a 
steep dip to the eastward; at one point are overturned against a con- 
siderable body of acid eruptives and diorite. On the line of the Rosario 
arroyo it consists mainly of diabase, with acid eruptives and diorites 
on their eastern flank. The latter cut the diabases, and are succeeded 
on the east by an extensive flow of rhyolite capping the mesa ridges 
which extend out into the interior valley. A little farther south dio- 
rites seem to form the main mass of the flat topped ridges which here 
represent the range, and which are flanked on the east, at the border 
of the mesa region, l>y recent tufaceous rocks, in which is found one of 
the few springs of the region. Along the line of the section south of 
San Fernando, diorites again predominate, and in these occur deposits 
of copper sulphides, one of which has been quite extensively mined. 

"It was not possible to determine the relative age of all the varieties 
of eruptive rock observed, but the older eruptives are evidently pre- 
Cbico, while some of the recent eruptives are certainly more recent than 
the mesa sandstones. 

" The rocks described above as acid eruptives are comjiact and some- 
times brecciated quartz-porphyries of greenish and brownish colors, at 
times quite aphanitic, and again showing small phenocrysts of feldspar 
and more rarely quartz, suflQciently developed to be recognizable by the 
naked eye. Chemical tests in the more aphanitic varieties yield 70 to 
75 per cent silica. The more common form of the diorite is a pinkish 
gray, finely granular rock, which in thin section shows a hypidiomorphic 
granular aggregate of quartz and triclinic feldspar with pale green 
hornblendes, in jjart or wholly altered to epidote. There are also a few 
sphenes and the usual iron ores. 

" In the upper Santa Caterina Valley, which crosses the range diag- 
onally in a nearly north-and-south direction, a very considerable mass 
of underlying granitic rock is exposed over an extent of about 10 miles 
along the bottom of the valley, which apparently grades into the finer- 
grained diorites surrounding it. Along the center of the valley a low 
ridge of rounded blocks of this very massive rock has the appearance 



980 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

at first glance of a morainal ridge with liuge erratics, but examination 
shows that the rounded forms are merely the results of weathering 
under the peculiar climatic conditions ot the region. The granite is 
an even-grained granular rock, thickly studded with small black scales 
of mica and small hornblendes. In thin section it shows a hypidio- 
morphic granular aggregation of quartz, feldspars, black mica, and 
deep green hornblende, with a sprinkling of iron ores, apatite, and 
rarely zircons. It resembles the granites of the Sierra Nevada. 

"Westward along the line of the section this granite is succeeded by 
the finer grained quartz mica-diorite described above, and then by a 
belt several miles in width of recent eruptives, which form low rounded 
hills adjoing the mesa region. These appeared to be mostly rhyolites, 
and to have cut through the sedimeutaries of the mesa region, though 
it was not possible to obtain unquestionable evidence of the latter fact. 

"On the east, or at the head of the Santa Caterina Valley, capping 
the flat ridges which form the western divide of the interior valleys, 
was found a rather remarkable rock of the hypersthene-audesite type, 
showing microscopically small olivines and white feldspars, with occa- 
sional black hornblendes in a dark gray matrix. In tliin section it 
shows a decided andesitic ground mass of augiteand plagioclase micro- 
lites, with the usual iron ores and abundant colorless olivines, pale 
hypersthenes, small pale green augites, and an occasional dark basaltic 
hornblende with black border. 

"Abundant chalcedony and flint concretions, with dendritic markings, 
constituting the popularly known moss agates, are found on the eastern 
slopes of these ridges. 

INTERIOR VALLEY. 

" The interior valley which was visited by the writers is probably that 
designated by Gabb as the plain of Buena Vista. In about latitude 
30^, or a little north of the line of the section, its width on a northeast- 
southwest line, or at right angles to the trend of the peninsula, is over 
15 miles, an almost level plain with a slight rise toward its eastern rim, 
which rests on the submerged flanks and crests of the eastern range. 
Its elevation varies from about 2,000 feet on the western to 2,300 feet 
on the eastern edge. To the southward its width is contracted by the 
encroachments of the bounding ranges which send out spurs or ridges 
into it, and in the far distance appear to merge together. The spurs 
from the eastern range are flat-topped in great part and composed 
of horizontally-bedded material, which, where examined, consisted 
largely of volcanic ash carrying abundant fragments of basic erup- 
tives. These are evidently the mesa sandstones of Gabb. Those 
from the western range, on the other hand, are composed largely of 
eruptive rocks and appear to be projecting portions of the older moun- 
tains laid bare by erosion, but in a few cases are mesa-topped ridges, 
capped by horizontal lava flows of later age than the mesa sandstones.

GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF LOWER CALIFORNIA. 981 

" To the north the valley appears to grow wider, and out of its midst 
rise a few conical peaks, the most prominent of which, known as San 
Juan de Dios [Plate 4], about 20 miles north of the line of the section, 
has a remarkably graceful outline and a probable elevation of over 
4,000 feet. It is composed, in great measure, of eruptive rocks, among 
which felsite, diabase, liparite, and basalt were recognized, while ero- 
sion has disclosed on one side an underlying coarse quartzite. At its 
base is one of the rare springs of the region. Similar peaks are seen to 
rise out of the plain far to the northward at probable distances of 10 
to 15 miles apart. 

" The slope of the broad stream beds in the lower part of the valley is 
so imperceptible that the direction of its drainage is difficult to deter- 
mine; but aneroid observations indicate that the portion examined is 
drained through the gap in the western range at the ruined mission of 
Sail Fernando (elevation about 1,800 feet), and thence probably by the 
San Fernando River bed to the Pacific Ocean. Limited portions of 
the eastern edge to the north of the line section are drained by deep 
and narrow arroyos of more recent formation into the Gulf of Cali- 
fornia. The present bottoms of the valleys are occui)ied by recent 
deposits of porous limestone or travertine and coarse conglomerate 
with calcareous cement containing rounded fragments of both eruptive 
and sedimeutary rocks in great variety and varying size up to several 
ieet in diameter. The evidence of wells which get water in the lower 
parts of the valley at 40 to 60 feet below the surface and of adjoining 
mesas in the valley, which afford partial sections, show a present thick- 
ness of little over 100 feet of these beds; but their elevation in shallow 
raviues — notably the one on the southeastern edge of the Buena Vista 
plain, in which are the New Pedrara onyx deposits, and remnants of 
calcareous conglomerates remaining on the flanks of the bounding 
ridges at other points — indicate that the original thickness of these 
deposits may have been several hundred feet, and that the greater part 
has already been removed by erosion. No fossil evidence was obtained 
as to their absolute geological age, but the character and iiosition of 
the deposits indicate that they were laid down in an inclosed body 
of water, probably an interior lake of comparatively recent date. 
What remains of these beds barely serves to smooth over the inequali- 
ties of the underlying mountains, whose component rock masses often 
outcrop across the stream beds, especially along the eastern portion of 
the valley. Even where there is no actual outcrop the ajipearance of 
frequent fragments of granite or sedimentary rocks, as the case may 
be, indicate that these rocks are to be found in place near by and not 
far from the surface. In some cases the ground is whitened over con- 
siderable areas by the abundant small fragments of vein quartz, result- 
ing from tlie disintegration of the underlying slates. 

<' The relative age of the interior lake beds may be assumed to bear 
some relation to that of the calcareous conglomerate already mentioned 



982 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

which partially filled the earlier canyons of the Pacific Slope. After 
the deposition and subsequent elevation of the mesa sandstones, which 
are assumed to be of late Tertiary age, there must have been a long 
period of erosion, during which the interior valley was carved out and 
drained through the deeper canyons running to the Pacific Ocean. 
This was apparently followed by an extensive submergence of 2,000 
feet or more, since wliich time the whole peninsula has been gradually 
rising by periodic movements, with considerable base leveling in the 

intervals. 

" The present elevation of the mesa-topped ridges of the western 
range indicates a base leveliug of the region at an elevation of about 
2,000 feet above present sea level. This might have filled up all the 
outlets of the interior region across the western range and admitted 
of the inclosures of a body of water up to that level; but to account 
for the present position of the deposits on the eastern side of the 
valley, it is necessary to assume a subsequent dift'erential movement 
by which that side has been raised a few hundred feet more than the 
eastern side." 

EASTERN RANGE. 

" The older or buried eastern range is made up of granite and gneiss, 
with highly altered sedimentary strata flanking it on the northeast, 
which stand either vertical or with a steep dip to the eastward and 
strike about northwest, or somewhat more to the west of north than 
the general trend of the peninsula. The present divide, on the other 
hand, follows the general trend of the coast line at a distance of 10 to 
15 miles from it, and is marked in general by abrupt escarpments along 
the eastern edge of the desert plain. 

"To the north of the limits of the field of observation, beyond the 
thirtieth parallel, the summits of the older range have been planned 
off and their depressions so evenly filled up by the more recent deposits 
that they play no part in the present topography of the country. To 
the south, however, where, east of the present divide, they have been 
denuded of the more recent deposits, or still farther south, where they 
were never completely covered by these deposits, they form conspicu- 
ous and striking topographical features, in marked contrast with the 
prevailing horizontal lines and broad shallow valleys of the western 
portion of the peninsula. 

" In the northern region the desert plains and flat-topped ridges of 
mesa sandstones risevery gently from the west to the divide line, which 
almost invariably presents an abrupt escarpment to the east, over- 
looking a region deeply scored by narrow gorges several hundred feet 
in depth, with almost vertical walls. Here the divide line is marked by 
occasional isolated table topped buttes, capped by rhyolite, which rise 
500 to 1,000 feet above the desert level and serve to mark the original 
level of the mesa sandstones, which have been protected from erosion 
by the cap of more enduring rock. These rhyolites are generally of

earlier date than the lake beds. The top of the mesa saudstones as 
thus determined is about 3,000 feet above preseut sea level, and their 
maximum observed thickness 800 feet. Augite andesite flows, appar- 
ently of more recent date, are found capping intermediate portions of 
the divide. The contrast in topographical structure between the region 
east and west of the divide is here less marked than in the region to 
the south, as on both sides approximately horizontal lines prevail. 
The surface of the mesa-topped ridges slopes upward toward it from 
either direction, but the slope is much greater on the eastern side and 
the ridges descend toward the gulf in a series of step-like terraces, 
while the whole eastern region is deeply scored by narrow, steep sided 
ravines from a few hundred to a thousand feet in depth. The upturned 
beds of the metamorphic series are well exposed along the walls of these 
ravines, often reaching the surface of the intervening mesas. They 
are also seen in the shallow stream beds of the desert plains on the 
west, and, as already remarked, often outcrop through the thin covering 
of the lake beds for a considerable distance out on to the desert. 

"South of the thirtieth parallel the summits of the buried range rise 
gradually, and east of the divide are completely denuded of any cov- 
ering of recent beds that they may have had. They also spread out to 
the eastward, approaching more and more closely to the gulf coast, and 
south of the limits of the iield of observation, or 20 miles south of the 
thirtieth parallel, they constitute a high granite range extending 10 or 
15 miles westward into the interior valley and effectually cutting oft 
any view of the country beyond. 

"The region in the vicinity of the New Pedrara onyx deposits, a few 
miles south of the thirtieth parallel, shows well the general structure 
of the eastern range as presented in generalized form in the section on 
plate 1, and will hence be described in some detail. 

"The principal onyx deposits are situated in a shallow ravine or 
eastern arm of the interior valley, between two ridges of mesa sand- 
stone, at an elevation of about 2,300 feet. Since the denudation of the 
granite bed of this ravine of its former covering of mesa sandstone it has 
been filled to a depth of about 100 feet by alternate beds of travertine 
and calcareous conglomerate, which were probably contemporaneous 
and at one time continuous with the lake beds of the interior valley. 

"The winding bed of the modern stream cuts into the travertine 
deposit, exposing at one place a cliff of over 20 feet in height, showing 
three distinct layers of " Mexican onyx," one of which is over 3 feet thick, 
interstratified with the travertine, while for a distance of nearly a mile 
down the ravine sheets of the more resisting onyx cap the little traver- 
tine mesas on either side. The occurrence of the onyx, which is a ther- 
mal spring and surface deposit in successive layers, separated by traver- 
tine and resting on conglomerate, indicates a probable successive rise 
and fall of the waters of the lake where the travertine was deposited, 
which would have admitted of some slight erosion of the deposit in 



984 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

the periods when the lake waters had temporarily retreated— a hypoth- 
esis that was confirmed by the finding of some fragments of onyx in 
the upper travertine beds. 

"At the head of the ravine the travertine beds end abruptly in an 
escarpment, beyond which one descends rapidly 500 feet through wind- 
ing ravines, between sharp, jagged ridges of a metamorplnc rock, to 
the bed of the Tule arroyo, a winding, yshaped gorge which runs north- 
ward about 10 miles, then northeastward to the Gulf of California, 
draining the whole region east of the divide. At one point this gorge 
widens out into quite a valley, in which are travertine deposits about 
50 feet in thickness, with layers of onyx in the upper part. Relics of 
the thermal action are found at the present day in a little eftervescent 
spring, known as the Yolcan, which issues from the top of a dome- 
shaped mound of calcareous tufa in the narrow bottom of the ravine 
before it opens out into the valley containing the travertine deposits. 
[See Plate 5.] 

" These travertine deposits are entirely isolated and have no present 
connection with those of the interior valley to the east of the divide, 
their level being about 400 feet lower than the divide, where the nearest 
lake-bed deposits end. The similarity of their composition, their rela- 
tions to the underlying rocks, to the onyx formation, and to modern 
erosion, all suggest, however, a common origin with the lake beds, and 
if once connected with them there must have been a diflferential move- 
ment since their deposition which produced the present difference of 
level. 

"Beyond the Tule arroyo to the eastward arise a series of sharp, 
jagged peaks which attain a maximum elevation of about 3,000 feet, 
deeply scored by a most intricate system of deep, winding ravines, 
quite impassable except to foot travelers, and which are in most strik- 
ing topographical contrast to the level valleys and plains of the region 
west of the divide. Within these hills at various points are placers 
from which the Mexicans obtain considerable coarse gold by dry wash- 
ing during the months immediately following the spring rains. At 
other seasons there is not enough water to support life. They are com- 
posed of distinctly stratified sedimentary beds standing on edge and 
striking northwest and southeast, but which are so highly metamor- 
phosed and so blackened and splintered by the weathering of this arid 
region that their original character can no longer be determined. They 
are mostly dark siliceous slates and fine-grained mica-schists. Some 
beds have all the external appearance of limestones in their granular 
structure and thin white veins, but their present composition shows 
no trace of lime and is almost entirely siliceous. They are traversed 
by well-defined dikes, which are also intensely altered. 

"Among the more striking rocks in this metamorphic series, at the 
northern limits of the area observed, was a fine-grained hornblende 
rock which microscopic examination shows to be properly an altered die-

rite. The ground mass consists of an aggregate of plagioclase feldspar, 
apparently auorthite, with fibrous hornblende containing inclusions 
suggestive of interpolations of hypersthene and diallage. Associated 
with this was a grayish massive rock thickly studded with short, stout 
crystals of black hornblende 2 to 5 millimeters in diameter and 5 to 8 
millimeters in length. Microscopical examinations show the ground 
mass to be a granular aggregate of almost colorless augites with a few 
plagioclase feldspars, and the rock apparently belongs to the group of 
hornblende-pyroxenites of Williams. When collected, these rocks were 
supposed to be interstratified with the metamorphic series, as their 
outcrops had the same general strike; the result of microscopical 
examination indicates that they are probably altered intrusive sheets. 

"The flat- topped ridge of mesa sandstones south of the ravine in 
which the principal New Pedrara onyx deposits occur is thickly strewn 
with subangular blocks of augite-andesite, which have apparently 
weathered out as the soft ash of which the beds are composed has 
worn away. At the eastern extremity of this ridge, on the very crest 
of the divide, is a high basalt-capped mesa, nearly a mile in diameter 
called by us Bhifl' Point. It has an elevation of about 3,500 feet, and 
overtops all the highest summits within a radius of 15 to 20 miles, thus 
offering an admirable point of view from which to study the physical 
structure of the region. The basalt cap has an aggregate thickness of 
500 feet, and consists of an upj)er layer of dark vesicular olivine- 
bearing rock 350 feet in thickness resting on 150 feet of gray, fine- 
grained rock containing abundant large crystals of olivine. The upper 
layer has a dark smoky glass base with the usual microlites of feldspar 
and augite and small phenocrysts of augite, olivine, and feldspar. 
Between these flows a zone of decomposition several feet in thickness, 
colored brilliant red by peroxidation of the iron, makes a prominent 
line, visible from a great distance, on the bluff faces which almost com- 
pletely surround the mesa. 

"The surface of the mesa has a gentle slope westward and ends to the 
eastward in an almost perpendicular escarpment overlooking the Tule 
arroyo 1,500 feet below, which has here widened out into a consider- 
able valley that drains the northern slopes of the White range far to 
the south. Beyond this valley, i^artly cutting off' the view of the Gulf 
of California, lies the group of dark rugged peaks of metamori)hic 
slates called the Volcan Peak group, which the Tule arroyo almost 
completely encircles in its circuitous course to the sea. Through the 
gaps in this range can be distinguished the pale blue waters of the 
Gulf of California and occasionally portions of the coast line, as well 
as several of the group of small islands which lie a few miles off' the 
shore in this latitude, and whose abrupt outlines show them to be 
probably j^rojecting points of the buried metamorphic ranges. 

"The arms of the interior valley, which lie to the south and west of 
the Bluff Point mesa, have a floor of granite which is entirely denuded 



986 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

of the mesa sandstone covering and of the lake beds, if the latter ever 
covered it. The granite is a light gray rock of normal type, consisting 
of two feldspars, quartz, and both white and brown mica. Hornblende 
was not observed. From general appearance and association it would 
appear to be a distinct and older rock than that found in the western 
range. To the south of these valleys the White range, composed of 
the same granite, stretches some 10 or 15 miles east and west across the 
peninsula, and apparently cuts off in great measure the interior valley 
in this direction. As no contacts were found, it was impossible to 
determine the relative age of the granite and the metamorphic series." 

ITINERARY. 

The party left San Quentin for El Eosario, some 40 miles to the 
south, late on the afternoon of July 19, our conveyance consisting of a 
"dead ex" wagon drawn by a pair of mules. That night we succeeded 
in making but about 7 to 9 miles, nearly the entire distance being over 
level sand plains, either quite bare or covered with cacti, sage brush, 
and in places with dense growths of strong-smelling shrubs with small 
harsh leaves and thorny branches. We encamped that night, as indeed 
every night, in the open air, and were on the road again by 6 o'clock 
the morning following. For nearly 10 miles the route lay along the 
hard sands of a beautiful beach facing the open Pacific. Thousands 
upon thousands of dark-colored sea fowl flew back and forth in long 
undulating lines, while small flocks of gulls, curlews, and an occasional 
brace of strong-flying pelicans enlivened the monotony of the trip. 
The sands were beautifully hard, clean, and white, with comparatively 
few shells or other indications of marine life. The disk-like shells of 
echinoderms, an occasional giant clam, and more rarely yet a few 
abalones were the most conspicuous forms. But this part of the trip 
was only too soon at an end, and leaving the beach we turned inland, 
journeying for the rest of the day over a nearly level i)lain with high 
mesa sands to the east. In the distance from San Quentin to El Rosa- 
rio fresh water was found but twice, and though in some cases the soil 
was good the lack of moisture leaves the country essentially a desert. 
This indeed is the condition of affairs throughout the entire region 
traversed, excepting where along the few streams a crude form of 
irrigation by the native Mexicans was carried on. Along the beach 
above alluded to the soils were light and sandy and bore no vegetation 
of suflicient size or proper foliage for casting a shade. Such plants as 
existed consisted mainly of cacti and small, nearly leafless, thorny 
shrubs. Earely the pole-like form of a giant cactus or an agave 
appeared in the distance, but much more abundant were elongated, 
serpent-like forms, 3 or 4 inches in diameter and of all lengths up to 10 
or more feet, growing singly or in clusters. 

A miserable variety of sage brush, with its half dead, half living, 
scrawny branches, was everywhere, while an occasional small, tubular-

shaped, very pretty pink flower showed up ia strong contrast with 
the general dreariness of the land. An "ice plant," an insignificant 
little thing growing close to the soil, of a green and wine red color, 
covered all over with jelly-like drops or tubercles, added also a slight 
amount of attractiveness, or at least gave interest to the scene. Small 
lizards darted about, and an occasional quail, jack or cotton-tail rabbit, 
a few butterflies, a large species of ichneumon fly, a few grasshoppers 
(some species of CEdipoda), and a black yellow-spotted spider which 
builds strong webs on the shrnbs, were about all that was visible in 
the way of animal and insect life, though in the soil, at the foot of the 
shrubs, I found occasional empty spiral shells of a land mollusk, the 
Helix stearnsiana of Gabb. After leaving San Quentin nothing what- 
ever in the way of reptile life was seen, although immediately about 
San Quentin a species of rattlesnake was said to be quite abundant. 
Beyond Rosario, with the exception of quail and mountain sheep and 
antelope well over to the east coast, no forms whatever of wild animals 
were observed, and even the numerous burrows of small nocturnal 
mammals, so abundant toward the north, were almost entirely lacking. 
About dusk we reached the divide which marks the limit of the desert 
here, and went rattling down the steep sandy slopes toward El Eosario 
mission and the sluggish shallow stream of the same name, but digni- 
fied in this country of arid wastes by the name of river. 

We reached the bottom just about that hour when it is too dark to 
see anything distinctly, to find a flat valley, perhaps a mile in width, 
hedged in on either side by steep bluffs of bare friable sandstone, and 
covered, where not cultivated, by a dense growth of greenish, pungent- 
smelling, almost leafless shrubs and a few willows. The short twilight 
came quickly to an end and left us lost, stuck in the sand in a dense 
growth of brush, from whence we were finally extricated through the 
aid of a Mexican, and about 9.30 p. m. found our way to an adobe hut, 
where we spent the night. 

Five o'clock the following morning, July 21, found us once more astir. 
While the head of the party was making arrangements for jiack and 
saddle animals, I improved the opportunity to utilize notebook and 
camera. El Rosario (Plate 2) consists of a few adobe huts scattered 
for a mile or more along the nearly level plains bordering on the river. 
From a historical standpoint its most interesting possession is the ruin 
of an old Franciscan mission, such as were once so abundant through- 
out the Mexican- Spanish possessions on this coast. The original build- 
ings are now almost entirely obliterated, only portions of the thick, 
massive adobe walls remaining standing. A small building of modern 
construction now contains the altar, crude images of the saints which 
resemble nothing more than grotesquely large wooden dolls, and 
ancient vestments, such as have escaped destruction. Two bells, each 
about 20 inches in height, are hung upon a T-shaped post made from 
the knees and other timbers of a wrecked vessel. One of these bells 



988 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

bears the date of 1784 aud the other 1800. A few miles up the river 
we saw in the distance ruins of an extensive series of buildings once 
forming a part of the mission, but now given over to silence and the 
basking lizard. In exploring these ruins aud still others at San Fer- 
nando, one could not but be impressed with the fact that, objectionable 
as may have been the system from a purely political standpoint, as a 
means of bettering the immediate condition of the people it was cer- 
tainly preferable to anything since inaugurated. In the place of the 
thriving villages of no mean size which here and there dotted the land 
wherever was suflicient water for irrigation, of well-kept adobe houses 
aud churches, vineyards, orchards of figs and peaches, of gardens and 
fields of grain, are now scattering huts in midst of ill-kept gardens or 
barren plains. Shiftlessness, squalor, desolation, and barrenness now 
reign supreme, where once was thrift and apparent prosperity. 

The buildings at El Kosario are, I believe, without exception, of 
adobe — one-story affairs with thick walls and roofs of poles thatched 
with straw or i^alm leaves, and with floors of stone or hard-trodden 
dirt. The schoolroom of the village was built of poles standing against 
the side of one of the adobe houses, and rudely interwoven with sugar 
cane. In this I found a dozen or so little bright-eyed Mexicans under 
the instruction of a male teacher whose years must have numbered at 
least 60. During school hours each scholar studies aloud, and the con- 
fusion produced can be imagined. Now one voice in its jabbering 
monotone would prevail; and now another, now louder, now softer, 
rising and falling in irregular cadences such as would shortly render 
an Eastern teacher insane, but in the midst of all of which the Mexican 
conducts his recitations and administers his punishments, corporeal and 
otherwise, with a calmness and indifference that led me at times to 
doubt his i)ower of hearing at all. All about the houses is dirt and 
sand; no lawns, walks, or roadways. In the yard, inclosed by adobe 
walls aud thorny poles of the fouquiera, were stretched lines, on 
which are drying long strips of meat. On the flat below ran the irri- 
gating ditches, where women were washing clothes, and which are 
bordered with fine large fig trees full of ripe, purple fruit, aud beyond 
which are peach orchards aud gardens. 

Shortly after noon of the 21st our outfit was declared ready and we 
mount and start, said outfit consisting of three horses, two mules, and 
one burro for saddle purposes, and two pack mules to carry provisions 
and camp utensils. The first 10 miles of our course lay due north up 
the Rosario Valley, the river bed becoming shortly little else than a 
dry ravine, with here and there an adobe house with the usual type of 
occupants. 

At the end of perhaps 10 miles we turned to the east up a lateral 
canyon or arroyo toward the mountain range, at the foot of which, by 
the side of a diminutive muddy spring, we made our camp. The stream, 
now dry, here enters a deep, steep- walled canyon, cut in granitic dio-

rite, which seems to form the main mass of the hills, though in the dry 
stream bed are abundant bowlders of granite, diabase, and more rarely 
liparite and andesite. 

The next morning- it was found that our animals, which had been 
merely hobbled in order that they might browse on the mesquite, had 
strayed so far that it was nearly 11 o'clock before we were once more 
in the saddle. In the meantime, while engaged in jjursuit of the ani- 
mals, the camera was more than once brought into requisition, some of 
the results being here reproduced in Plates 6 and 7. The giant cactus, 
Cereus pringJel^ Plate C, is about 25 feet in height by 20 inches in diam- 
eter at the butt. 

Larger forois, jterhaps 35 to 40 feet in height, occur, but this was 
selected for photographing simply on account of its accessibility and 
from its being in fruit, as shown in the knob-like excrescences near the 
top. This fruit consists of a beautitul dark carmine pulp, with black 
seeds, inclosed in an envelope or rind so beset with small needle-like 
thorns that he who plucks needs fingers of brass. The appearance of 
this pulp in that dry, hot region was tempting in the extreme, but the 
realization disappointing, it being almost tasteless, and even failing to 
quench the thirst. These awkward forms, resembling nothing more 
than clustered mill logs standing on end, were quite abundant, though 
widely scattered. Some were straight and limbless as saw logs; others 
gave off three or four or more clumsy branches a few feet from the 
ground, as shown in the illustration. 

Another striking form seen here for the first time is the Fouquiera 
columnaris shown in Plate 7, and which becomes more abundant on the 
inland plateau. Although in greater dimensions, some 40 feet in height 
and 15 to 18 inches in diameter at the base, these strange forms were 
readily cut down with the back of my geological hammer, and showed 
in cross section a structure not greatly unlike that of our ordinary 
Eastern sunflower {HeUanthus annuus Linnteus) in that they have a 
thin exterior or rind of a greenish white color and an interior core of 
white pith-like material. 

The numerous branches, which are about the size of an ordinary lead 
pencil, pass directly through the hard, woody rind into the pith. When 
the plant dies, the limbs fall out, the pith shrinks away and decays, 
leaving the trunks in the form of collapsed elongated cylinders full of 
spirally- arranged perforations. These branches are very abundant, and 
project uniformly in every direction, sometimes to a distance of 2 feet 
or more. They are stiff, harsh, and thorny, and it was found possible 
to gain access to the trunk without seriouslj^ tearing the flesh only by 
turning up one's coat collar, putting on gloves, bowing the head, and 
backing in. Even then the work of cutting through the bark is disa- 
greeable, though the bark or rind is itself thin and tender. 

A landscape of these pole like forms, with their thorny branches and 
few small, brittle, thick, yellow green leaves is weird in the extreme, 



990 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

and particularly so about dusk. Dry, hot, leafless, noiseless, and appar- 
ently lifeless, it conveys vividly to the imagination the idea of a burnt- 
out world. (See Plates 3 and 8.) 

The writer is informed by Chief Botanist F. V. Coville, of the 
Department of Agriculture, that this plant was first described by Dr. 
Albert Kellogg nearly forty years ago, under the name of Idriacolum- 
naris,^ a new species of the family Fouquieraceie, the description being 
based on specimens brought from Lower California by Doctor J. A. 
Veatch. The validity of the species was afterwards questioned and the 
plant doubtfully referred to Foiiquiera sjnnosa, until in 1889 Mr. T. S. 
Brandegee fully established its distinctness from that species.^ 

As we ascended the mountains and jjassed the crest to the plateau 
on the east, the country became, if possible, more and more forbidding. 
The scanty soil and scattering growth of desert plants quite fail to 
cover the rocks, which stand out bare and hot, weathered to a dull 
reddish color. There is absolutely nothing that can cast a shade or 
boast a thornless leaf. Yet there were beautiful and interesting things, 
if one could but stop under that scorching sun, to admire. A barrel- 
shaped cactus from inches to 4 feet in height, with long strong sharply 
recurved thorns, shows delicate green and pink tints, and often has a 
circle of beautiful deep scarlet flowers on the top. The agave begins 
to appear; a little insignificant cluster of leaves growing on vertical 
cliffs takes the form of a rose, and is coated with a flour-like bloom. 
The tints are delicate greenish white, sometimes pinkish, and when one 
can rid himself of the idea that the whole country is accursed, he finds 
it beautiful in the extreme. 

We camped that night (the 22d) on the banks of a stream no longer 
running, but yielding in standing pools sufficient water for our imme- 
diate needs, passing on the way the only habitation seen between 
Eosario and San Juan de Dios. Mesquite grew abundantly along the 
dry bottoms, and there was a plentiful supply of quail, but no other 
forms of animal life were seen. From this point to San Juan de Dios 
the most striking feature of the landscape are the rounded, boss-like 
forms of the hills, due to the weathering of the granular, massive dia- 
bases and diorites of which they are composed. The region is one of 
limited rainfall, but subject to great diurnal changes of temperature. 
The agents of disintegration are therefore heat and cold, and as a result 
the debris from the massive eruptive rocks consists mainly of angular 
fragments, each of the larger fragments consisting of an aggregate of 
minerals, scarcely at all discolored by oxidation, and differing from the 
parent rock only in their state of partial disaggregation. This gravel 
and sand, disturbed but little by other than wind erosion, accumulates 
on the slopes until the outcrops become largely buried in their own 
debris and partake of the rounded character noted above. During the

day we passed over the landscape shown in Plate 8 and crossed a low 
divide, where the "lost mountain" type of structure, already described, 
became first evident. The ground was covered with angular and 
sharply-rounded pebbles of acid and basic eruptive rocks, interspersed 
with thin crusts of lime carbonate, indicative of lake-bed deposits. A 
small outcrop of hard, compact, reddish quartzite was passed a few 
miles before San Juan de Dios, which place we reached about 3 p. m. 
on the 23d. 

A little stream makes up out of the rocks in a canyon, flows a short 
distance, and sinks in the sand. Yet 'tis enough for human needs, and 
here in his adobe hut, thatched with palm leaves, lives a Mexican rais- 
ing cattle and children (Plate 4). We are given a hearty welcome, and 
fed bountifully on stewed quail, beans, skim milk cheese, wild honey, 
and the leathery tortilla, made from corn crushed on the aboriginal 
metati. 

The landscape here, except in the creek bottoms, retains its general 
desert aspects. The flora is composed of various species of cactus, 
among which the log-like cereus already mentioned is conspicuous. 
The Fouquiera and agave also abound. The large tree shown is a Cot- 
tonwood, which I learned was not indigenous, but brought when a mere 
slip from San Diego, California. 

The hill shown is composed at its base of compact brecciated quartz 
porphyry and diorite, capped by a light porous liparite. Small out- 
crops of black basalt occur well uj) the slopes, which are covered by 
bowlders rounded and waterworn of liparite and andesite. 

The following morning (July 24) a general round-up was held, and 
new animals obtained as far as possible, those obtained at Eosario 
being already footsore. As the distance to the next water was estimated 
at from 35 to 40 miles — a distance far too great for one day, over rough 
trails and with unshod animals — it was decided to delay our start until 
about noon, making a dry camp at night and finishing the trip the day 
following. This was the programme finally carried out. 

The first few miles of the route lay upward through narrow canyons 
with steep, precipitous walls and loose, rocky bottoms, the slopes being 
covered with bowlders of liparite, and the country rock consisting of a 
loosely consolidated and irregularly bedded coarse gravel and bowlder 
aggregate cemented by fine sand. Finally, emerging from the canyon, 
or arroyo, we found ourselves on a high, level, liparite-topped plateau, 
which extends for miles in a northerly and westerly direction. The 
Agave shaicii, with central stalk 10 to 15 feet in height, stand here by 
the tens of thousands in full bloom in the midst of piles of rocks so hot 
and forbidding that in spite of myself I drive by with scarcely a look. 
These continue abundant well over toward the east coast and are often 
beautifully symmetrical. For years these plants gather from the stingy 
soil the necessary nutriment for the flower stalk, storing it up in their 
thick, fleshy, bayonet-like leaves. When the season finally arrives, 



992 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

they slioot up iu a surprisingly short space of time a single stalk, 
sometimes 10 feet in height and 4 inches iu diameter at the base, bear- 
ing at the top a raceme of honey yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. As 
the stalk shoots upward the leaves yield to it their stored-up juices, 
shrivel, and die. Thousands of these were passed during the day, in all 
stages of youth, maturity, and old age. 

Continuing in a general easterly direction we soon reached the limit 
of the plateau and plunged, by means of steep and often dangerous 
trails, abruptly down several hundred feet where, for a distance of 20 
miles or more, we traversed an undulating plain covered with sand and 
loose bowlders, some rounded and others sharply angular, with lake- 
bed exposures wherever the now dry water courses were cut to a suffi- 
cient depth. The few antelope seen at a distance were the only signs 
of animal life noted during the day. We camped that night (the 24th) 
in the sand of a dry, shallow water course, resuming our journey at 
3.30 the next morning. Sharply-serrated mountain peaks, suggestive 
of volcanic cones, were seen in the distance, and about noon our plain 
ends in a precipitous canyon cutting across heavy bedded, dense, blue 
gray quartzites, which so strongly resemble limestones as to cause 
them to be mistaken for this rock until they came to be tested in the 
laboratory. In addition to this quarzite is a finely fissile, nearly black, 
mica-schist, both rocks standing neai'ly on edge and with a strike some 
20° west of north and south. A dike of brecciated felsitic rock was also 
noted. As the disintegration here, as farther to the west, is mainly 
due to temjjerature changes, the schistose rocks weather into splintery 
forms and the general topographic features may be described as ragged 
in the extreme. The drainage from this point is toward the gulf, 
through ravines, arroyos, and canyons innumerable. 

We find water and make our camp on the afternoon of the 25th in 
what is locally known as the Tule Arroyo, some 15 miles from the gulf 
coast. Two insignificant little springs bubble up here in the dry bed 
of the stream, furnishing, when first gathered, a pleasant sparkling 
fluid so highly charged with carbonic acid as to resemble the soda water 
of the drug stores. On standing, however, it soon lost its effervescent 
property and became so stale as to impart a decidedly disagreeable 
taste even to the coffee. Our first meal here consisted of stewed 
potatoes and dark lieavy Mexican bread, as tough and indigestible as 
so much dried putty. Fortunately for us our Mexican guide went 
down the arroyo toward the gulf and returned before night with the 
carcasses of two mountain sheep, which kept us supplied with meat for 
the remainder of the trip, the atmosphere being so dry that there was 
no difficulty whatever in preserving it. The heat of the arroyo during 
the day was intense. The high walls on either hand afforded shade 
during the early morning and late afternoon, but during the middle 
portion of the day life was only rendered tolerable to those who stayed 
in camp by lying at full length in the sand under an immense mass of 
rock that had fallen from the cliffs above.

Aside from the "tiile," a flag which, from the shape of its leaf and 
the characteristic cylindrical spikelike form of its blossom and fruit, was 
assumed to be the common "cat tail" {Typha latifolia) of the Eastern 
States, and clusters of rushes, shown in the foreground of Plate 5, in 
the bottom of the arroyo, there were on the slopes above numerous 
cacti, one or more species of Spanish bayonet, the Fouquiera splendens^ 
and numerous agaves. The most striking of the floral forms, and one 
which was seen here and only here, was the peculiar dwarf-like Veatchia 
cedrocensis, or elephant wood (Plate 9). These were rarely more than 
10 feet in height, though sometimes a foot or more in diameter at the 
butt, and widely branching. Some of the smaller forms, but a foot or 
so in height, enlarged abruptly into bulb-like forms, 3 or 4 inches in 
diameter, on the immediate surface of the ground. The leaves and 
yellow blossoms are small and inconspicuous, and scarcely show at all 
in the rather j)Oor photograph from which the accompanying engraving 
was made. 

The water from the springs above mentioned flows into depressions 
in the rocky basin, forming pools, in which were found numerous water 
beetles and one hemiptera, similar, so far as the writer could judge, to 
the backswimming water boatman {Xotoneeta) of the Eastern ponds. 
The water itself is sufficiently charged with carbonate of lime to deposit 
a sinter on the surface over which it flows. During an earlier history 
these springs, issuing from near-by vents, have built up large dome- 
shaped masses of sinter, as shown in the left middle back group of 
Plate 5. Before the arroyo was cut to its present depth, springs were 
evidently more numerous, and tufa or travertine deposits of considera- 
ble extent are found upon the adjoining slopes. A large portion of this 
material is of a dull brownish gray color, slightly compacted, cellular, 
and of only geological interest. Occasional patches occur, however, of 
the same material of a white color, or beautifully tinted and veined 
with green and rose, and so compact as to acquire, in the hands of a 
workman, a surface and polish like glass. It is, in short, the onyx 
marble of commerce.^ 

Monday, July 27, the work of inspecting the onyx quarries in the 
desert to the southeast having been completed, a start was made once 
more for Eosario, though over for the most part a somewhat different 
route. After leaving the canyon, or arroyo, .and the rocky divide, our 
route lay over an undulating desert plain with flat-topped mesas on the 
southeast and mountain peaks visible on all sides. A portion of the 
plain was actually paved with basaltic fragments, though no basalt 
flow in place was observed. The onyx beds, noted above, lie in some 
cases like a pavement on the floor of the desert, the chief flora and 
general character of the landscape being as shown in Plate 10. At the 
end of the second day from the arroj^o, i. e., Tuesday night, July 28, we

camped at Sau Fernando, now represented only by the ruined mission 
and a few huts, occupied by Mexicans and their numerous progeny, 
while twice the number of dogs and a million times as many fleas 
served to fully sustain the national reputation. 

The high mountain ridges at San Fernando are in part of compact 
greenish quartz porphyry, sometimes so jointed as to resemble stratified 
sedimeutaries with gentle slopes toward the east and more precipitous 
toward the west. Passiug, next morning, northward and eastward of 
San Fernando, the range from a slight distance shows highly tilted 
stratified beds, and the landscape, with its pole like Fouquiera, is weird 
in the extreme, particularly about sundown. (See Plate 3.) For the 
remainder of the journey the route lay over a region essentially iden- 
tical with that already described, San Quentin being reached early in 
the morning of July 31 in season to catch the fortnightly steamer for 
San Diego.

THE MINERALOGICAL COLLECTIONS IN THE U. S. NATIONAL 

MUSEUM. 



By Wirt Tassin. 
Assistant Curator, Department of Minerals, U. S. National Museum. 



A mineral collection in a public museum should present all of the 
detinite varieties of minerals occurring ready formed in nature, their 
associations with other minerals, their occurrences, and finally their 
chemical, morphological, and other i^hysical features. It must meet 
the needs of the chemist, the crystallographer, the j)hysicist, the geolo- 
gist, the petrographer, the student, and the observer who may desire 
to obtain concise and specific information in any and all branches of 
mineralogy, and finally it should be a university extension of the 
broadest kind where one may secure a knowledge of minerals from 
the cases with as little reference to the library as i)Ossible. 

With these ends in view the mineralogical collections of the National 
Museum are divided into three general series — the exhibition series, 
the study series, and the duplicate series. The first of these, the exhi- 
bition series, is primarily intended for the public and the student. It 
is divided into two parts — the systematic series and the comparative 
series. 

THE SYSTEMATIC SERIES. 

The systematic series treats of the properties of minerals in their 
relations to the several kinds of minerals, and the description and sys- 
tematic arrangement of the several species. Here will be found the 
several rei)resentatives of the mineral kingdom, selected to illustrate 
occurrence, association, color, and typical development. Here too are 
to be found the rough and cut specimens of gems and ornamental 
stones, tlie collection of meteoric bodies, and the "special locality" 
collections illustrating certain regions in the United States where a 
mineral or a series of minerals occur under noteworthy or special 

conditions.

998 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

GENERAL ARRANGEMENT. 

The systematic series is divided into two general classes — native 
elements and compounds of the elements. The compounds of the ele- 
ments are further divided and grouped under certain heads according 
to, and which take their names from, their more negative constituents 
as follows: Compounds of the halogens, fluorides, chlorides, bromides, 
and iodides. Compounds of sulphur, selenium, and tellurium; also 
arsenic and antimony, including sulphides, selenides, and tellurides; 
arsenides, antimonides, sulpharsenides, and sulphantimonides; also sul- 
phosalts. Oxygen compounds, including oxides and the oxygen salts, 
borates, aluminates, ferrites, chromites, manganites, uranates, carbon- 
ates, silicates, titanates, columbates, tantalates, nitrates, vanadates, 
phosphates, arsenates, antimonates, sulphates, chromates, tellurates, 
molybdates, and tungstates. Compounds of organic origin, including 
salts of organic acids and hydrocarbon compounds. 

Each of these classes is further separated into groups, the minerals 
included in any one group being such as are related in the miiiior 
details of chemical composition and physical properties. Each of these 
groups is preceded by a general group label giving the class to which 
it belongs, the group name, the minerals composing that group together 
with their chemical composition, system of crystallization, and a short 
description of the occurrence, association, and characteristic form of 
each member of the group. The following label will serve to give a 
clearer idea of this arrangement: 

Tungstates, 

Wolframite Group. 

Wolframite, (Fe,Mn)W04 Monoclinic. 

Hiibnerite, MnW04 Monoclinic. 

Wolframite. — Chiefly ferrous tiingstate, with some manganese. It occnrs in irregu- 
lar lamellar, coarse divergent columnar, and granular masses, and in crystals, com- 
monly tabular. Color and streak nearly black. Wolframite is often associated 
with tin ores, and with quartz carrying bismuth, scheelite, pyrite, galena, sphaler- 
ite, etc. 

Huhnerite. — Chiefly manganese tungstate, with some iron. It occurs in bladed 
forms and massive in quartz, and with alabandite, rhodonite, scheelite, fluorite, and 
apatite. Color brownish red. hair brown to nearly black. Streak yellowish brown. 

Following the group label, arranged in order from left to right, are 
the several members of the group, selected to illustrate as completely 
as possible their occurrences, associations, and variety in form and 
color. Each specimen is mounted upon a block, in front of which is a 
small label giving the name of the species, the minerals associated 
with it in that particular specimen, if any, its locality, catalogue num- 
ber, and from whom and how received. 

The several groups are placed in regular order in the cases, and each 
case carries a case label giving the name of the class to which its con- 
tents are referred. In the upper left hand corner of each case is a 
numeral followed by an arrow, which serves to indicate the sequence 



MINERALOGICAL COLLECTIONS IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 999 

in which the cases are to be studied, and also to facilitate reference to 
the text of a descriptive catalogue soon to be printed. 

The arrangement of the "special collections" is essentially the same, 
except that in place of the group label there is a general descriptive 
label applying to the entire case, as follows: 

ZINC MINERALS OF NEW JERSEY. 

Ores of zinc in workable quantities are found in New Jersey, at Franklin and 
vicinity, Sussex County. The region is unique in that the deposit consists almost 
entirely of a mixture of the oxides and anhydrous silicates of zinc. The ore depos- 
its are in beds or veins that are conformable with the stratification of the rocks in 
which they are embedded; they jjitcli to the northeast, they dip to the southeast, 
and they lie in a fold. The zinc minerals occur in the gangue rock associated with 
a variety of limestone carrying manganese, and with a manganese garnet. The run 
of the mine is usually a mixture of franklinite, willemite, and zincite. 

Franklin ite is iron black in color, having a metallic luster, a hardness varying 
from 5.5 to 6.5, and a specific gravity of 5. It is slightly magnetic, crystallizes in 
regular octahedrons, and is also massive, granular to compact. It has the chemical 
composition ZnFe:0^. 

Willemite varies in color from apple green, flesh red, to manganese brown. Its 
hardness is 5.5, specific gravity 4. It is rarely crystallized, occurring usually in 
disseminated grains or masses. It has the chemical composition Zn2Si04. 

Zincite is of a dark red color, occurring usually foliated massive, or in coarse par- 
ticles or grains, sometimes having, a granular structure. Its hardness is about 4, 
and it varies in specific gravity from 5.3 to 5.7. It has the chemical composition 
ZnO. 

THE COMPARATIVE SERIES. 

The comparative series treats of the several characteristics or prop- 
erties of any one mineral species as applied to all other mineral si:)ecies. 
This series is intended i)rimarily for the student of mineralogy. Here 
the properties of minerals are illustrated and defined. In each case 
the label containing a definition of the property under consideration 
precedes a series of specimens, and, wherever they can be used advan- 
tageously, a series of models illustrating that property. One example, 
that of "composition", will serve to illustrate the methods used in this 
series : 

COMPOSITION. 

All minerals are composed of either an element alone or two or more elements in 
combination. Elements are said to combine when on bringing them together a new 
substance is produced, differing from and possessing properties which, as a rule, are 
not the mean of those of its constituents. For example, the gases hydrogen and 
oxygen under the proper conditions combine to form water — a liquid. These combi- 
nations are represented symbolically by the juxtaposition of the symbols of the 
couibining elements. Thus a molecule of water, composed of two atoms of hydrogen 
and one of oxygen, is represented by the symbol H.O. The multiplication of a 
group of atoms is denoted bj^ placing the proper numeral to the left of the group of 
symbols or by inclosing them in brackets and placing a small numeral at the right; 
thus 3H:0 or (HjO).; denotes three molecules of water. The combination of groups 
is expressed by placing their symbols in juxtaposition with a dot between them; 
thus Fe:0:;.II.O denotes a compound of oxide of iron with water. Sometimes a comma 
or the sign -|- is used in place of the dot. Further, the letter R is used to denote a 
varying group of equivalent elements ; thus RCb^Os is a compound in which there is a 
varying amount of the equivalent or isomorjjhic elements of the rare earths. 



1000 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Following this label is a series of six typical elements with some of 
their native combinations. Each specimen is monnted on a block as in 
the systematic series, in front of which is a small label giving the name, 
composition, locality, etc., of the individual. 

THE STUDY SERIES. 

i'his series contains all that material which appeals exclusively to the 
specialist. It is the source of the material from which new exhibition 
series are built, or old ones strengthened. In it is placed all that mate- 
rial which has been the source of investigations, or which it is thought 
may be made the subject of research. It contains all those specimens 
which serve to illustrate the occurrence and associations of a mineral 
in any one locality that are not needed for the exhibition series, or which 
are not unnecessary duplications of material already on hand. 

Each specimen in this series is numbered, labeled, and placed in a 
paper tray. The several specimens are then arranged geographically 
by species; the species arranged in groups, as in the systematic series, 
and placed in drawers. Each drawer contains but one species, and a 
label giving the contents of that drawer is pasted in the upper left-hand 
corner of its front. 

This series also includes all the original and type material belonging 
to the Department. These are brought together in a series of drawers 
reserved for that purpose, and all of the type or original specimens 
which are not needed to complete the exhibition series are here placed, 
together with a copy of the original papers, or at least a reference to 
them, and a bibliography in which the work has appeared. Those types 
used in the exhibition series are here indicated by a card giving its 
exact position in the cases. 

THE DUPLICATE SERIES. 

This series includes all that material not needed for the exhibition or 
study series; and from it all exchanges, gifts, etc., are made up. 

INSTALLATION. 

The species and varieties of minerals — that is, the systematic 
series — are arranged in forty-six slope front-floor cases. Beginning with 
the first on the right, entering the hall from the north, the contents of 
these cases are as follows : 1-2, native elements ; 3-4, fluorides, chlorides? 
bromides, and iodides; 5-9, sulphides, selenides, tellurides, arsenides, 
antimonides, and sulphosalts; 9-16, oxides; 17, borates, aluminates, 
chromites, ferrites, manganites; 18-22, carbonates; 23-37, silicates; 
38, titanates, columbates, and tautalates; 39, nitrates and vanadates; 
40-42, phosphates and arsenates; 43-45, sulphates; 40, chromates, 
molybdates, tungstates, and uranates. The several special collections, 
which may be recognized by their case labels, are contained in the cases 
marked A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., in the plan (Plate 1). The wall case W 
on the west side of the hall contains the comparative series.

THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 



By Frederic A. Lucas, 
Curator, Department of Comparative Anatomy, U. S. National Museum. 



The tongues of birds have been not exactly overlooked, but some- 
what neglected, by ornithologists, and it is the object of this paper to 
note a few of their interesting features and to call attention to some 
of the problems connected with them, in the hope that our younger 
ornithologists may devote some time to their study. The collecting of 
skins is undoubtedly the most attractive form of ornithological work, 
and I do not wish to be looked upon as in anyway disparaging this 
branch of ornithology with its bearing on the questions of iiulividual 
variation, color changes, geographical distribution, and the like; but 
there are so many points on which general deductions can only be 
made through the patient accumulation and careful sifting of facts 
that it seems at least unfortunate that more attention is not paid to 
them by those who have the leisure to do so. It is an easy matter for 
anyone engaged in collecting skins to gather abundant material for 
the study of tongues,' and it seems a pity that so many good speci- 
mens should have been wasted when they could so readily have been 
preserv^ed. 

While the tongue is so intimately related to the beak, there is less 
unity of purpose between them than might at first sight be supposed, 
and the size or shape of the one is no criterion as to the size or shape 
of the other. The beak of a bird serves the purpose of a hand. 
With it he chips the shell and introduces himself to the world; with 
the beak the bird gathers its food, preens its feathers, builds a nest. 
He may use it, like the parrots, in climbing, or, like the Carolina parra- 
keet, may even hang himself up to sleep on the inside of a hollow stump. 
It would sound well to continue the simile, and say that as the bird's 
beak is a hand, so the tongue is a finger; but the true and the beauti- 
ful are by no means as synonymous as one might wisli, and all that 
can be truthfully said is that sometimes, or to some extent, the tongue 

^Thus, my friends, Messrs. William Palmer, E. J. Brown, and the late R. S. Mat- 
thews, while collecting the birds of Washington and the vicinity, have supplied me 
with a large amoiint of material, all the more valuable because it was quite fresh. 

1003

plays the role of a finger. This use of the tongue may be very evi- 
dent as when a parrot manipulates a nut, turning it about with the 
tongue while holding it between the mandibles, and it seems quite 
evident, too, that many graminivorous birds, like the crossbill and 
goldfinch, must use their tongues in a similar manner to extract seeds. 
But if not used as a finger, the indications are that the tongue does 
play an important part either in obtaining food or in its subsequent 




Fig. 1. 

manipulation. As there are very many things still to be learned 
regarding the food of birds, and as we can seldom watch them closely 
in tLeir native wilds, it is in the majority of cases impossible to directly 
prove the relation between the food and the tongue. If positive evi- 
dence is lacking, however, circumstantial evidence is plentiful, and 
there are numerous cases where it is difficult to account for the shape 
of the tongue, if it does not have a direct bearing on the question of 
food. 

Before passing on to a consideration of the tongue, it will be well to 
look at the bones which support and form a part of it, for these have 



THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 1005 

to do not only to some extent with the shape of the tongue, but on 
them depends the power of movement, of extending and retracting the 
tongue, and the ability to suck up the nectar of flowers. These little 
bones (fig. 1 a), when all are present, are eight in number, the three 
foremost corresponding to the hyoid, the five hindmost to the first gill 
arch, of a fish. The shape of these may vary somewhat, the proportions 
much more, but, after all, the differences between them are not very 
great. Tlie tongue is attached principally to the two foremost bones, 
while the others are maiidy concerned with the motions of the tongue, 
furnishing attachment for the muscles by which it is protruded and 
retracted, as well as serving as guides to make the apparatus run true. 
The varying proportions of the bones tell something of the importance 
of the tongue and something of its use. If the foremost bones tire 
well developed, then the .tongue is thick and fleshy, as in the duck, 
and has considerable to do in obtaining or manipulating food (fig. 1 c). 
If the foremost bones are small, or are represented by cartilage, then 
the tongue plays an insignificant part, as in the cassowary, or is a mere 
rudiment, as in the cormorant and pelican (fig. 1 h). If the hindmost 
bones are long, the tongue is protruded in getting food, and the length 
of these bones is a direct measure of the extent to which the tongue 
can be extendea. The proportions of the intermediate bones, the 
ceratobranchials, have to do with the length of the bill. 

The hyoid probably has a more direct relation to the tongue in birds 
than in any other group of vertebrates. Among mammals the most 
important office of the hyoid is to support the larynx, and this duty it 
often performs very effectively. In reptiles the hyoid has much to do 
with breathing, and in turtles, whose ribs are so tied up as to be of no 
use in respiration, the hyoid may be seen working backward and for- 
ward, forcing air into the lungs. The hyoid of frogs is mostly orna- 
mental, being a hint that the tadpole had an elaborate and well- 
developed system of gills, which was put off' together with the tail. In 
fishes the hyoid forms a firm support to the gill arches, although it also 
supports the tongue. In birds the two ceratohyals, or glossohyals, as 
they are sometimes called from their intimate connection with the 
tongue, are embedded in the tongue and usually terminate in cartilages 
which are prolonged for some distance forward well toward the tip 
of the tongue. Their posterior portions end in the main posterior 
points of the tongue (fig. 1 a). 

There is an intimate relation between the dermis and the epidermal 
layer of the tongue, and if a thin tongue is held \\\) to the light, the little 
blood vessels may be readily seen running into the harder portion. At 
the same time, if a tongue is allowed to macerate for a little, the con- 
nection between the dermis and epidermis is easily broken down and 
the horny external layer may be slipped off as a glove is drawn from 
a finger. 

A very curious thing happens in the titmice — to be exact, this is 



1006 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



known to happen in Farus carolinensis, the only species in which I 
have examined the young and traced the growth of the tongue; but the 
tongues in this group are so siniihir that I have ventured to generalize 
from an observation, which is, I admit, a very bad practice — where the 
epidermal sheath of the tongue is perforated in front, allowing the 
cartilaginous anterior portions of the ceratohyals to project through. 

The smallest and simplest style of tongue is found in some of the 
fish-eating birds, those which, like the cormorant and pelican, gulp 
down their food whole, and here tongue and hyoid are mostly, or 
entirely, in the soft pouch. Flesh eaters, too, have comparatively sim- 
ple tongues, and so have many of our little song birds, such as the 
thrushes; and as this type of tongue is the ground plan on which much 
more complicated tongues are found, it will serve as a good starting 
point. The tongue of the robin is rather thin and horny, somewhat 
thicker toward the base, or hinder portion, slightly split or feathered 
at the tip, and provided at the back with a row of fleshy backwardly- 

directed spines. With the 
excejjtion of these spines, 
whose purpose seems to be 
to start food in its downward 
course, this tongue bears no 
evidence of adaptation to 
any particular kind of food. 
This style of tongue, thin, 
slightly cleft, and more or 
less feathered at the tip, may 
be called the typical pattern 
for thrushes, warblers, and 
the great host of our North 
American birds. An almost endless number of tongues may be derived 
from this simple pattern by slight changes in proportions, amount of 
curvature, number of posterior points, and extent of feathering. Trim 
off the tip a little and curl up the edges, and we have the tongue of a 
shore lark (Plate 1, fig. 12) ; lengthen the tongue and feather it more at 
the tip, and we have the tongue of a rusty blackbird, and between these 
two we have no end of varieties. Still, among all these there is no special 
modification hinting at adaptation to some particular kind of food, for 
most of our small birds have considerable latitude in the way of diet. 

Not only is there much specific variation in birds' tongues, but there 
is also a considerable amount of individual variation in the degree of 
feathering or whipping out of the tip. Part of this is due to wear, for 
some birds, like some people, appear to use their tongues more than 
others, with a consequent loss of the delicate fringing at the tip, but 
part of it is due to natural variation, for the unworn tongues of two 
birds of the same species may have a very diff'erent aspect. Whether 
or not the outer sheath of the tongue is molted, as some birds shed

and renew the horiiy covering of their beaks, is not known to me, but 
if this is not the case, the growth of the tongue must be comparatively 
rapid to prevent it from being worn to the quick. 

The tongues of the North American honeycreepers of the genus 
Certhiola are an elaboration of the warbler type, being finer and more 
complicated in detail, long and slender, much hollowed out toward the 
tip, deeply cleft, and decorated with long incurved featherings. An 
Australian honeysucker, Acanthorhynehus tenuirostris, carries the fining 
down of parts to an extreme, having a delicacy of structure which 
can be appreciated only with a glass. The tongue of still another 
genus of ISTorth American honeycreepers, Cocrcba (fig. 3 c), differs 
from those just described in the matter of detail by splitting the tongue 




Fig. 3. 

more deeply and increasing the length of the feathering which rolls 
inward from either edge so that the tongue ends in two spiral brushes 
of extreme delicacy. The Hawaiian and Australian honeysuckers 
show a still farther advance on this, for in them each of the main 
branches of the tongue is cleft in twain, and these may again bifurcate 
so that the tongue ends in four or eight small spiral brushes. By a 
very little modification a true suctorial tongue, such as that of the sun- 
birds, Cinnyris, or of the genus Hemignathus (fig. 3 b), may be derived 
from that of the "srarbler type. If, instead of splitting and feathering 
the tip, the edges of the tongue are rolled upward and inward until 
they meet, a tube will be formed, and this tubular tongue, as well as 
the others, is subject to various modifications and may become quite 
complicated. In the sunbirds the edges simply touch each other and 



1008 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



the tube is single; in Yestiaria the edges pass by and the tube becomes 
triple, while by division it may terminate in two or four tubes, as the 
case may be. 

The real effectiveness of a tubular tongue depends not only on the 
tongue itself, but on the action of the hyoid and its controlling muscles, 
just as the usefulness of a pump does not lie in the pipe, but in the 
valves. The manner in which suction is eftected has been well' 
described by Doctor Gadow,^ and is, in substance, as follows : By the 
contraction of the mylo and serpio hyoid muscles which underlie the 
tongue, that organ, together with the larynx, is pressed up against the 
roof of the mouth. The tongue is then protruded and the larynx and 
back part of the tongue depressed, thus creating a vacuum between 
tongue and palate, and into this vacuum will flow any liquid into which' 
the tip of the tongue may have been inserted. The fringing of the 
tip of the tongue, or its conversion into a spiral brush, causes liquid to

ascend to the tubular portion of the tongue by capillary attraction, and 
thus overcomes any tendency of air to enter the tongue and prevent 
suction. 

If we go back to what we may call the primitive pattern of tongue 
and make the upper surface thick and fleshy instead of thin and horny, 
we will have such a tongue as characterizes many, if not the majority, 
of seed-eating birds, while between the two come such tongues as those 
of the swifts and swallows, owls and goatsuckers. The amount of vari- 
ation in these last named groups is not great, and there is no wide 
departure from what may be termed the standard pattern. The tongues 
of the titmice and nuthatches may either be looked upon as modifica- 
tions of the sparrow type, or as having a pattern of their own. Those 
of the titmice (Plate 1, fig. 14) suggest a four-tined pitchfork, and can 
be better understood from the figure than from any description. Those

of the nuthatches, while coustructed on the same plan as those of the 
titmice, are more complicated, and resemble a series of rods placed side 
by side. 

The tongues of swifts and swallows (Plate 1, figs. 1-3), just referred to, 
maybe called typical insectivorous tongues, since they are found in birds 
whose food consists largely, if not entirely, of insects. 
This style of tongue is slightly fleshy, but not so 
thick as in the seed eaters, and in a great many 
si)ecies bears, toward the base, numerous papilhe, 
while in others papilke are distributed more or less 
regularly over the tongue. These may be small and 
blunt, or they may assume the form of spines; in any 
case their object appears to be to work food backward 
toward the gullet. Furthermore there is often a plen- 
teous supply of sharp backwardly directed points about 
the glottis, all to the end that food may glide safely 
past the windjiipe. The tongues 
of owls (Plate 2, fig. 5), while hav- 
ing an individuality of their own, 
are intermediate between those 
of the goatsuckers and the diurnal birds of prey, 
being rather fleshy and armed with small spines 
on the posterior half. In some birds of prey there 
is a system of large pores opening on the base of 
the tongue, and in advance of the glottis. 

Many water birds, such as gulls, sandpipers, 
rails, and herons, may also be said to have simple 
tongues, and so do at least some of the pigeons 
and fowls. From their simplicity it would seem 
that the tongues of these birds do not play an im- 
portant part, unless, indeed, the slender tongues 
of some of the snipe family have a delicate sense 
of touch which enables them to discriminate in 
the matter of food, and this, from the horny con- 
dition of the tip, seems rather improbable. 

There are other types of tongues found in other 
groups of birds, while there are many birds whose 
tongues have an individuality of their own and 
decline to follow any general pattern; in fact, 
when we come to know more about the tongues 
of birds, that the exceptions are as numerous as 
the resemblances, or, as with the votes on a preliminary ballot, there 
are many scattering. 

The humming birds, so far as known, have a uniform pattern of 
tongue (Plate 2, fig. 12), long and slender, deeply cleft, with each slender 
branch bordered with a delicate inroUed membrane, which gives the

front half of the tongue the character of a double tubeJ The base of 
the tongue is formed by the soft, fatty, fibrous envelope of the basihyal, 
which stretches like a mass of india rubber when the tongue is pro- 
truded, and, like rubber, contracts when the tongue is retracted. 
Immediately in front of this is the dense cartilaginous sheath of the 
ceratohyals, forming the bulk of the tongue and practically consisting 
of two portions — that investing the bony part of the ceratohyals and 
that surrounding their cartilaginous prolongations. The ditferencc 
between the character of the epidermis of these two parts is such tbat 
in badly preserved or slightly macerated specimens the anterior part 
may be slipped ofl" intact. If this is done, it will be found to be a 
hollow tube of cartilage, grooved along the middle above and below, 
and slightly grooved along the upper, outer surface. This tube is soon 
divided by a vertical partition, while a little more than halfway 
between base and tip the tongue forks, each branch continuing hollow 
for some distance. A fold, or flange, commences near the base of the 
tongue, on either side, and continues to the tip, growing wider and

thinner as it proceeds, until along the branches it becomes a very deli- 
cate membrane. As previously stated, it is these two membranous 
portions which become rolled into tubes, and when the tongue of the 
humming bird is spoken of as being tubular, it is these branches which 
are meant. To say that the tongue consists of two iiarallel muscular 
tubes is quite erroneous, as is the statement that the tubular portion of 
the tongue is drawn back into a muscular sheath. It seems a little 
doubtful if the tongue of the humming bird can be a true suctorial 
tongue, for the tubes formed by the anterior part of the tongue are not 
long enough to reach the back of the mouth, neither are they tight 
along the edges,~ although, owing to their small size, liquid would 
undoubtedly rise in them by capillary attraction. Gosse, who observed 
these birds in confinement, seems to furnish the clue to the action of 



' Much confusion and bickering have been caused by more or less loose descriptions 
of humming birds' tougnes, unaccompanied by good explanatory figures, and it has 
been vigorously asserted, and quite as vigorously denied, that the tongue of the 
buinming bird was bollo-w, or tubular. 



THE TONGUES OF BIRDS.

the tongue when he says that in drinking sirup the tongue is protruded 
for half an inch or so and worked rapidly backward and forward. In 
doing this the tip of the tongue would naturally fill with sirup when 
protruded, and when the tongue was retracted it would "either be 
brought far enough back for a vacuum to be formed at the base or 
liquid could be forced out by pressing the tip against the roof of the 
mouth as the tongue was 
again extended. 

The tongues of wood- 
peckers (Plate 2, figs. 8, 
9), so far as they have 
been observed, are con- 
structed on one plan, 
being long, slender, and 
pointed, round or ellipti- 
cal in cross section, 
slightly barbed on either 
side at the tip, and with 
the upi^er surface cov- 
ered with backwardly 
directed spines so min- 
ute that it needs a mag- 
nifying glass to properly 
appreciate them (fig. 7). 
There are no si)iues at 
the base of the tongue 
itself, as in most birds, 
for the tongue, when re- 
tracted, is withdrawn 
into a sheath, or makes 
its own sheath, tis when 
a gloved finger is drawn 
back and the glove 
doubles upon itself. In 
most species the tongue 
is very extensile — the 
sapsuckers {Sphyrapi- 
cus) are exceptions — 
and since, as said in the beginning, the extensibility of the tongue 
depends on the length of the epibranchials, we find that these are very 
long, in most cases even longer than the head. Such being tlie case, 
some special provision has to be made for disposing of the hyoid when 
the tongue is retracted, and this provision is obtained as follows: The 
two branches of the hyoid pass up over the back of the skull, coming 
together at the top, and then (usually) turn to the right and continue 
onward over the forehead, onward beneath the nostril into the beak, 
and thence quite to the tip. Still another method is found in some 




Fig. 8. 



1012 



REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



individuals where the ends of the hyoid curl about the eyeball instead 
of dipping into the beak, but this is found less often than the other. 
The tongues of some species— the ilicker, for example— have but one or 
two barbs at the tip, others have half a dozen, and still others twenty 
to thirty, the barbs becoming finer as they become more numerous. 
Finally, in the sapsucker the barbs have degenerated into stiff hairs, 
which, instead of raking backwards, stand out from the side like the 
bristles on a chimney cleaner. 

It is interesting to note the modifications 
by which the hyoid is made effective as a 
probe, or spear, since for this last purpose it 
should be as rigid as possible. The two fore- 
most i^ieces of the hyoid are much reduced 
in size, and are united to form a leaf-shaped 
Ijoint, although we have a hint, in the pres- 
ence of a groove or perforation, that this 
point really consists of two bones. The shaft 
of the spear is partly formed by the long 
and slender basihyal and partly by the two 
ceratobranchials, which are brought close 
together Avhen the tongue is protruded. 
These last are attached directly to the rear 
of the basihyal — an arrangement which in- 
creases the power of the thrust. (See fig. 1 e.) 
The ducks have one general type of tongue, 
and while the mergansers differ much from 
the broad-beaked species, as might imturally 
be expected, it is possible here, as among the 
woodpeckers, to see underlying the modifica- 
tions that all are but variations of one type. 
The sides of the tongue are provided with 
several series of overlapping bristles, inter- 
spersed with tooth-like projections, which are 
simply bristles on a large scale, or bristles 
fused together, as the horn of a rhinoceros 
is composed of agglutinated hairs. There 
may be only three or four of these teeth 
toward the base of the tongue, as in the ring- 
necked duck (fig. 8 a), or they may prejionderate, as in the Canada goose, 
a species in which they reach the maximum of development, the tongue 
being armed on either side with a row of saw-like teeth. Finally, there 
may be no teeth at all, as in the hooded merganser (fig. 8 b), whose slen- 
der, gutter-shaped tongue bears on its edges only a series of bristles 
pointing obliquely upward. Ordinarily they point obliquely downward, 
suggesting a straw-thatched roof, but in any case their apparent func- 
tion is that of a strainer to aid in securing food. 




THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 1013 

Other types of tongues are doubtless found in other groups of birds, 
but whatever the general plan on which the tongue is built, the varia- 
tions' in the execution of details appear to be almost infinite in num- 
ber, as if nature had striven to have no two tongues exactly alike. 

It is a question of interest to ornithologists wiiether the tongues of 
birds are modilied according to the nature of the food, or whether, 
underlying all modifications, are certain definite plans of structure 
indicative of relationship. If the tongues of birds do bear a direct 
relationship to the character of the food, or the manner in which it is 
taken, we should not be surprised to lind that birds which are only dis- 
tantly related have very similar tongues, provided their food or feeding 
habits were similar, while near relatives might be very different in this 
respect. We should also be able in many cases to see the connection 
between the shape of the tongue and the character of the food. On 
the other hand, if the tongue is of any value in classification, it should 
be possible to tell something of a bird's affinities from an examination 
of the tongue. Theoretically, too, we would suppose that the less the 
tongue was used the smaller the probability of its being adaptively 
modified, and that the chances of finding a likeness between the tongues 
of the various members of a group ought to be greatest in a group in 
which the tongue played an unimportant part in getting or manipulat- 
ing food. Conversely, diflerences between the tongues of nearly related 
species might be expected if those species used their tongues, while the 
greater the similarity between the two species in the manner of obtain- 
ing food the greater would be the chances of finding their tongues 
modified in the same manner, although small differences might be 
expected since the chance of absolute identity would be small. 

To make a fair test of the correctness or incorrectness of these proj)©- 
sitions, we should compare nearly related species with entirely different 
food habits, or very distinct species with similar food habits. 

Were we to be guided by the members of a group like the humming 
birds, we would at once say that the tongues did have a decided value 
in classification, since we find that all these little birds have the same 
style of tongue. To offset this, we have the fiict that the humming 
birds have all practically the same habits, eat the same kind of food, 
and take it in the same manner, so that really they throw no light on 
the subject. The penguins present an analogous case, for while the 
tongues of all are strikingly similar to one another, the habits and food 
of all are also similar. 

The tongues of woodpeckers, at least those of our North American 
species, can readily be distinguished as such, although they differ con- 
siderably from one another in length and in the amount and character 
of the barbing at the tip. It is an easy matter to follow, step by step, 
the changes by which the sharp barbed tongue of the pileated wood- 
pecker is converted into the brushy tongue of the sapsucker, and as 
we pass from species to species we can see the barbs becoming more 



1014 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 



iiuuierous, longer, and more slender, cbanging from barbs to bristles 
and from bristles to liairs, until the transformation is complete and the 
spear lias become a brusli ; ' or, if we strip ofi" the adaptive disguises, we 
will find tbat the liyoid, whether long or short, is constructed on the 
same plan, and may see at a glance that CeopMxviis and Sphyrapicm 
are akin to one another. At the same time it is an equally easy matter 
to tell considerable of the food and habits of a Avoodpecker from the 
tongue, to make a guess as to the probable preference of the species for 
animal or vegetable food, and to say whether it spears grubs, eats 
insects, or probes after ants. Here the tongue apparently points two 

ways, not only indicating relationship, but 
more than hinting at the dietary habits of its 
possessor. 

The tongues of the swifts have a very close 
resemblance to one another, so do those of the 
swallows (Plate 1, figs. 1-3), and the two groups 
are so much alike in this respect that it is 
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to tell 
them apart. Now externally swifts and swal- 
lows are very much alike, their food and the 
mode of taking it is identical, and yet struc- 
turally the two are widely separated, ptery- 
losis, skeleton, muscles, alimentary canal, all 
being different. Here, then, if we followed the 
tongue, we should be at sea, and in this case 
we may feel pretty safe in saying that the 
resemblances between the tongues of swifts 
and swallows are due to the influence of food. 
The case may be further strengthened by show- 
ing that birds not very closely related to either 
swift or swallow resemble them in the general 
style of their tongues, and this is true of at least the cedar bird and one 
of the trogons (Plate 1, figs. 4 and 5), Friotelns, while further examina- 
tion will probably bring to light further resemblances. 

The owls furnish good examples of similarity of tongues arising from, 
or at least correlated with, similarity in habits, for the genera Megas- 
cops, Asio, Wyctea, Speotyto, and Strix have tongues built on the same 
plan, the main difference being that tStrix, which is a long-faced bird, 
has a long tongue. It might perhaps be assumed that because the 
beak was long the tongue would of necessity be long also, but this by 
no means follows, for the short tongues of the long-billed kingfishers 
warn us that there is no necessity iu the case at all, and that the length 
of the bill is no index to the length of the tongue. 
The opposite state of aff'airs, differences among related birds, is well

snowii iu certain flucbes where members of the same genus even may 
have quite different tongues, although the direct connection between 
these differences and the character of the food may not be evident. 
The tongues of the several si)ecies of the genus Spinus, shown on Plate 
2, figs. G-10, although constructed on the same general plan, offer con- 
siderable differences of detail, our common goldfinch, Spinus tristis, 
being the most highly specialized. The members of the genus Melo- 
spiza differ even more among themselves, and while Lincoln's sparrow, 
M. lincolni, may have the tip of the tongue perfectly simple, the song 
sparrow, M./asci<ita, has the tip quite elaborately fringed. So common 
a bird as the English sparrow has an aristocratically unique tongue, 
quite unlike that of any of his relatives on this side of the Atlantic, 
and still other finches might be adduced to show how great is the range 
of form in this family.' 

The hooded and the red-breasted mergansers are quite different from 
each other in their tongues, and yet, so far as we know, there is not 
sufficient difference in the nature of their food to account for this dis- 
crepancy; neither does the fact that they have been deemed sufficiently 
far apart to be placed in two distinct genera signify, for the swifts and 
swallows show that birds belonging in different suborders even may 
have very similar tongues. 

The reasons for the modifications of the tongue of the red-breasted 
merganser are evident; the two rows of sharp, reverted spines on the 
tongue, which are more nearly teeth than are the serrations of the bill, 
are to help the bill in catching and swallowing small fishes, while the 
feathering of the edge may be to aid in capturing still smaller fry, 
although it is quite as probable a hint of affinity with the other ducks. 
The tongue of the hooded merganser, which is like that of a duck 
reversed, is a puzzle whose solution calls for a better knowledge of the 
food and habits of the bird. 

Finally, not to needlessly multiply instances of differences between 
the tongues of related species, it may be said that while the petrels 
have much similarity iu food and habits they differ very materially in 
the matter of tongues. 

It is next in order to produce circumstantial evidence in the shape of 
tongues whose peculiarities can be apparently explained by the char- 
acter of the food or known habits of feeding, iu order to demonstrate 
the close relations between the two. The number of evident adapta- 
tions would undoubtedly be very much increased could we observe 
birds more closely in their native slate, for we might then see the rela- 
tion some curious tongue bore to some special kind of food, or catch 
the particular trick of manipulation for which it was adapted. 

Most insectivorous birds swallow their prey without any special 
manipulation, and this, to a great extent, is true of the fruit eaters.

1016 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Graminivorous birds either need, or find it advantageous to have, some 
special device for getting seeds or for husking them before they are swal- 
lowed, and these have fleshy tongues, which, together with the char- 
acter of the tip, must enable them to hold seeds well while removing 
the husk. Apparently the delicacy of the tongue is no direct criterion 
of the quality of the work done by it, for the cow bunting, which cleans 
small seeds most dexterously, is by no means remarkable for the char- 
acter of its tongue, and, on the other hand, it is not easy to see why the 
song sparrow should have a tongue so finely fringed at the tip. 

Such scoop-like tongues as those of the cross-bill and goldfinch (Plate 
1, figs. C and 11) seem to bear a direct relation to the procuring of food 
and to be specially designed for extracting seeds. Were thistles in 
seed the year around, the tongue of Spinus tristis would be a clear case 
of adaptation, for it appears admirably fitted either for gathering thistle 
seeds or for removing the husks after they are gathered. However, Mr. 
Palmer tells me that the gullet of the goldfinch often contains finely-com- 
minuted food, almost in the condition of dough, and the tongue is very 
likely the instrument by which this state is brought about. Knowing 
that the shore lark feeds largely on small grass seeds, the tongue is seen 
to be a nice little scoop for collecting them, while the miniature pitch- 
forks of the titmice (Plate 1, fig. 14) are equally good instruments for 
picking spiders, eggs of insects, and similar food, out of the crevices 
into which these little birds are perpetually prying, although it would 
apparently be more efficient could it be protruded farther. 

The brush-tongued birds, the South American Cocrehidw and the 
honeysuckers of the Sandwich Islands and Australia, are good exam- 
ples of similarity of tongue structure in very different birds due to 
adaptation for a certain kind of food or method of obtaining it. These 
birds frequent flowering trees, either for the nectar of the blossoms or 
for the insects which lurk therein, or for both, and their tongues are 
all more or less extensile, and brushy at the tip. Whether the liquid 
is actually sucked up or whether it is dipped up by the tongue tip as 
by a swab, the result attained is the same. 

Some of the brush tougued birds certainly eat insects and spiders, 
but the tongue would seem to be as well adapted for sweeping up these 
as for sucking up sweets. Moreover, it should be remembered that a 
tongue may be a special adaptation for a given kind of food, procured 
at certain seasons of the year, and therefore specially desirable only 
for a short time. Or a bird may i)refer a particular kind of food, and 
yet eat something else when that is not to be had, just as the hairy 
and downy woodpeckers have tongues specially adapted for spearing 
grubs, and still eat beechnuts. We know that humming birds are 
fond of sweets, and we are equally certain that the bulk of their food 
consists of insects,^ and if they dine on one and make their dessert of the

THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 



1017 






other, the adaptive features of the tongue can still be accounted for. 
So the fact that the houeycreepers eat berries and the honeysuckers 
and sunbirds spiders and insects does not disprove the primary adap- 
tation of their tongues for getting nectar. At the same time it is to 
be noted that tubular and brushy tongues occur only ( ?) 
in birds of tropical or subtropical regions, where flowers Jm 

are to be found throughout a great part of the year. m ^ 

The woodpeckers afifoKl a good illustration of the y ^ 
modifications of the tongue according to the nature of f i| 
the food, for in this group each variation iu the tongue 
appears to be accompanied by a corresponding varia- 
tion in the general character of the 
food.' The flicker has fewer barbs 
on its tongue than any other species; 
also it has one of the longest tongues 
and the largest salivary glands. Xow, 
the flicker eats more ants than any 
other species, these insects constitut- 
ing about forty per cent of its food, 
and it not only obtains them from the 
surface of the ground but by probing 
for them in anthills. The three-toed 
woodpecker heads the list of eaters of 
grubs, and this bird has, in addition 
to a long and fairly well barbed 
tongue, an nnusually good bill for 
cutting into trees: in fact, it may be 
said that the two go together, for 
similar conditions are found in other 
species. The little downy woodpecker comes next as 
a destroyer of wood-boring larvii^, unless it should be 
exceeded by the great pileated woodpecker, with its 
powerful beak and sharp tongue. The sapsucker 
seems to eat no boring grubs, but as an ant-eater it 
stands next the flicker, the contents of its stomach 
averaging thirty-six per cent of ants. It is, as its 
popular name implies, a drinker of the sap of sweet 
trees, and it also preys upon the flies and otherinsects 
which are attracted by the exuding sap. The brushy 
tongue (fig. 11) is well adapted for procuring such 
articles in the bill of fare, but it is quite useless for extracting grubs from 
their hiding places, being barbless and capable of but little extension. 
The red-headed woodpeckers, although possessed of very extensile 
tongues, have these organs rather feebly barbed, while they also have

l)ointed, little compressed beaks, not well adapted for cutting into wood, 
and the members of the genus Melanerpes are seemingly more fond of 
fruit than are any other species, and they are the most omnivorous 
of the IS'orth American woodpeckers. 

In all these cases the relation between form and food is plain, but 
there are many others in which peculiarities of the tongue imply modi- 
fication for some special end without that end being obvious. Such is 
the case with the penguins, whose curious spiny tongues (fig. 12) must 
play some definite part iu their domestic economy, but whether modified 
for the catching of fish, crustaceans, or squids is not quite clear, 
although such tongues would seem to be well adapted for catching 
small crustaceans. 

The tongues of our American vultures too should have some bear- 
ing on their diet, and possibly their hollow shape and roughened edges 
are for the purpose of rasping meat from bones, although it may be 
that the adaptation is to quite a different end. The long, slender, 
feathery tongues of toucans present another riddle which can only be 
answered by one having full knowledge of their habits, although it 
certainly seems a curious adjunct to the stout beak with which it is 
associated. 

From what has been said above it will be seen that, in a large num- 
ber of cases, there is certainly a clear relation between the shape of the 
tongue and the character of the food ; that some closely related birds 
differ as to their tongues while distant relatives present similarities 
that seem to be connected with similarities in their food, and that, on 
the whole, the modifications of the tongue appear to be adaptive and 
do not offer characters that can be safely used in classification. 

A final point, deserving of study, is that of the changes which take 
place during growth and the rapidity with which they are performed. 
As is well known, the bills of long-beaked birds are acquired after 
hatching, and long tongues grow in a like manner, such a slender, exten- 
sile tongue as that of the humming bird being developed between the 
time the young emerges from the egg and the date of quitting the 
nest. The first indication of the long branches into which the tongue 
is ultimately divided consists of a little notch in the tip, while there is 
only the merest rudiment of the membrane which is to border these 
branches (Plate 2, figs. 10-13). 

The growth of the tongue, and of the hyoid as well, must be quite 
as rapid iu woodpeckers as in humming birds, for in a full-fledged 
nestling of the downy woodpecker, a species which is provided with 
one of the longest of tongues when adult, the hyoid barely reached 
to the center of the skull, between the eyes. The same specimen 
showed also that the barbs at the tip of the tongue are developed com- 
paratively late, for the only trace of spines in this bird, which would 
have soon quitted the nest, was a number of reflexed hairs represent- 
ing the upper series on the tongue of the sapsucker. It seems prob-

able that the barbs make their appearance at, or shortly after, the time 
the bird leaves the nest, when the young cease to be fed and begin to 
feed themselves, but a little positive evidence in the shape of speci- 
mens is needed to settle the question. 

In birds with shorter tongues than those just described the changes 
during growth are, naturally, not so marked; but even in tongues like 
those of the chimney swift and screech owl there is a very obvious 
difterence between the tojigue of the embryo, or nestling, and that of 
the adult. 

The question of growth with its change of form connected with 
change of food, or in the manner of getting it, is worthy of careful con- 
sideration, but perhaps the most interesting problem presented by the 
tongues of birds is whether underlying the infinite modifications of 
the tongue are certain definite forms which may be of use in classifica- 
tion, or whether these forms are all cases of adaptation to particular 
kinds of food. 

The evidence seems to point plainly in the latter direction, but what 
is needed is a large collection of carefully sifted and assorted facts.

HE ONTONAGON COPPER BOWLDER IN THE U. S. NATIONAL 

MUSEUM. 



By Charles Moore. 



In a corner of the National Musenm a bowlder of native copper, 
weighing perhaps three tons, rests upon a plain wooden base. Trans- 
ferred to the Museum from the Patent Office, in 1858, the coi)per frag- 
ment was accompanied by no records, and this paper has been written 
with the view of tracing the intricate but interesting story of the once 
celebrated Ontonagon bowlder. 

Worshipped as a manitou by the superstitious Indians during 
uncounted years, the siren of mining adventurers while yet the flag 
of England floated over the Lake Country, the objective point of haz- 
ardous expeditions by explorer and scientist, the Ontonagon bowlder 
has never been so left to itself as it has been during the half century 
that has elapsed since it was brought to the national capital, where 
the expectation was that all eyes might gaze upon it as the represent- 
ative of national wealth and enterprise. 

About the middle of the seventeenth century the Jesuit missionaries 
and the French explorers, penetrating the wildernesses about Lake 
Superior, found among the most treasured possessions of the Indians 
pieces of copper weighing from 10 to 20 pounds. Often these frag- 
ments of copper were regarded as household gods, and from an 
indefinite past had been transmitted from generation to generation. 
Tradition also told of larger masses of copper situated at several 
points along the shores of the great lake, whose shifting sands often 
covered up the bowlders for years at a time, thus causing the super- 
stitious savages to declare that their ofl:ended deities had disapj)eared 
for a season.^ 

In 1067 a piece of copper weighing a hundred pounds was brought 
to Father Dablon. "The savages," he reports,- ''do not all agree as to 
the i^lace whence this coi)per was derived. Some say it came from 
where the [Ontonagon] Eiver begins; others say close to the lake; and 
others from the forks and along the eastern bank." Whether the

1024 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Dablou fragment was a float piece of copper, or whether it was a por- 
tion broken from the great rock, it is impossible to say. The reference 
of the Jesuit father, however, makes it evident that at the time when 
he wrote, the Indians were familiar with the copper region along the 
Ontonagon, on the west bank of the west fork of which river the great 
bowlder lay when discovered by white men. 

In 1669 the French Government sent Louis Joliet to Lake Superior 
to search for the deposits of copper so often referred to in the relations 
of the missionaries, but he got no farther than Sault Ste. Marie, and 
three years later he turned aside from such material pursuits to 
accomplish, in company with Father Marquette, the discovery of the 
Mississippi Eiver. So far as authentic records go, the first white man 
to visit the Ontonagon bowlder was Alexander Henry, an English 
adventurer, and he saw it to his cost. Shortly after England acquired 
Canada from France, Henry established himself as a trader at Macki- 
nac, and his narrow escape from death at the hands of the savages in 
the massacre at that post in 1763 forms one of the most thrilling chap- 
ters of Parkman's "Conspiracy of Pontiac," and is also the basis of 
Mrs. Catherwood's more recent story, " The White Islander." 

In 1771, lured doubtless by the mass of copper at the forks of the 
Ontonagon, Henry and his associates undertook to pierce the blufls of 
clay and red sandstone which bordered that stream,' in the hope of find- 
ing the vein whence the bowlder came. Only complete ignorance of 
the geology of the Lake Superior region can explain what Doctor 
Houghton calls "these Quixotic trials ;"^ and complete failure was the 
natural result. 

In 1819, General Lewis Cass made the first explorations of the Lake 
Superior region that were undertaken by this Government. Turning 
from their jjath, his party ascended tbe Ontonagon Eiver for 30 miles 
to visit the mass of copper whose existence, says Cass, had long been 
known. "Common report," he writes to John C. Calhoun, Secretary of 
War, "has greatly magnified the quantity, though enough remains, even 
aftera rigid examination, to render it a mineralogical curiosity. Instead 
of being a mass of pure copper, it is rather coi^per embedded in a hard 
rock, and the weight probably does not exceed 5 tons, of which the rock 
is much the larger part. It was impossible to procure any specimens, 
for such was its hardness that our chisels broke like glass. I intend to 
send some Indians in the spring to procure the necessary specimens. 
As I understand the nature of the substance, we can now furnish them 
with such tools as will eflect the object. I shall, on their return, send 
you such specimens as you may wish to retain for the Government or 
to distribute as cabinet specimens to the various literary institutions of 
the country."^

THE ONTONAGON COPPER BOWLDER. 1025 

Doctor Henry R. Schoolcraft, who was a member of the Cass exijedi- 
tioD, says that the bowlder was found on the edge of the river, directly 
opposite an island and at the foot of a lofty clay bluff, the face of which 
appears at a former time to have slipped into the river, carrying with 
it detached blocks and rounded masses of granite, hornblende, and 
other rock, and with them the mass of copper in question. " The shape 
of the rock," he says, "is very irregular. Its greatest length is 3 feet 
8 inches; its greatest breadth, 3 feet 4 inches, and it may altogether 
contain 11 cubic feet. In size it considerably exceeds the great mass 
of native iron found some years ago upon the banks of the Eed Eiver, 
in Louisiana, and now deposited among the collections of the New 
York Historical Society, but, on account of the admixture of rocky 
matter, is inferior in weight. Henry, who visited it in 176G, estimates 
its weight at 5 tons; but, after examining it with scrupulous attention, 
I do not think the weight of metallic copper in the rock exceeds 2,200 
pounds. The quantity may, however, have been much diminished 
since its first discovery, and the marks of chisels and axes upon it, with 
the broken tools lying around, prove that portions have been cut off 
and carried away."' 

Schoolcraft calls attention to the fact that the connection of the 
bowlder with substances foreign to the immediate section of the 
country where it lies, ''indicates a removal from its original bed, while 
the intimate connection of the metal and matrix, and the complete 
envelopment of individual masses of copper by the rock, point to a 
common and contemporaneous origin, whether that be referable to the 
agency of caloric or water." 

Schoolcraft gives a view of the copper rock (see Plate 2) taken from 
a point below the mass of copper, looking up the river; and from the 
picture one readily understands with what difficulty the mass was 
removed. The story of that removal is now to be told. 

The party sent by Cass were not so fortunate as he anticipated they 
would be. They cut about thirty cords of wood, which they placed 
about the bowlder, and then set fire to the pile. When the copper was 
well heated, they dashed water upon it, but the only result was to 
detach pieces of quartz rock adhering to the native copper. The party, 
having become disheartened, left the country, having moved the rock 4 
or 5 feet from the bank of the river; nor did the Barbeau party, who 
went from Sault Ste. Marie two years later, have any better success. 
It so happened, however, that Mr. Joseph Spencer, a member of the 
Cass expedition, told the story of the copper rock to Mr. Julius Eldred, 
a hardware merchant of Detroit; and for sixteen years this enter- 
prising man schemed and planned how he might succeed where others 
had failed.^

1026 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

Until the report made by tlie State geologist of Michigan, Doctor 
Douglass Houghton, in 1841, there had been no authentic or trustworthy 
statements in regard to the copper-bearing rocks of Lake Superior;' 
but within four years from the date of that report the mineral lands 
from the tip of Keweenaw Point to the Ontonagon Eiver were overrun 
with prospectors, the great majority of whom left dollars where they 
found pennies. It is in Doctor Houghton's report that the best scientific 
account of the copper rock is to be found. " I have thus far," he says, 
"omitted to allude particularly to. the large mass of native copper which 
has been so long known to exist in the bed of the Ontonagon River, 
lest, perhaps, this isolated mass might be confounded with the veins of 
the mineral district. That this mass has once occupied a place in some 
one of these veins is quite certain, but it is now perfectly separated 
from its original condition and appears simply as a loose transported 
bowlder. * * * The copper bowlder is associated with rocky matter, 
which in all respects resembles that associated with that metal in some 
portions of the mines before described, the rocky matter being bound 
together with innumerable strings of metal; but a very considerable 
portion of the whole is copper in a state of purity. While this mass of 
native copper can not fail to excite much interest, from its great size 
and purity, it must be borne in mind that it is a perfectly isolated mass, 
having no connection with any other; nor does the character of the 
country lead to the inference that veins of the metal occur in the imme- 
diate vicinity, though the mineral district crosses the country at a dis- 
tance of but a few miles." 

Leaving for the moment the question as to the origin of the copper 
rock, let us follow its history. Prior to 1843 not a pound of copper had 
been shipped commercially from Lake Superior. The billion and a half 
jjounds which have been taken from that region have been mined since 
that year, and more than half that product has been taken from a mine 
discovered since the war of the rebellion ended. The Ontonagon bowl- 
der was not regarded primarily in a commercial light; for its market 
value as ingot copper could not have exceeded $000.^ Mr. Eldred's 
object in transporting it to the lower lakes was to exhibit it for money 
in the various cities of the East. It was a curiosity. As Senator Wood- 
bridge said, it was " a splendid specimen of the mineral wealth of the 
' Far West.' " 

In 1841 Mr. Eldred arranged with Samuel Ashman, of Sault Ste. 
Marie, to act as his interpreter in the purchase of the copper rock from 
the Chippewa Indians, on whose lands it was situated. Obtaining a 
trading license from Mr. Ord, the Government agent, the two men set 
out for the mouth of the Ontonagon, where they met the chiefs and con- 
cluded the purchase for $150, of which sum $45 was paid in cash at the

time, and the remainder was paid in goods two years later. The party 
then x)roceeded about 26 miles up the river, climbed the high hill 
which intervened between the main stream and that point on the fork 
where the rock was situated, and raised it on skids. More than this 
they could not do; nor did they have greater success the following 
summer. 

In 1843 Mr. Eldred started from Detroit with wheels and castings 
for a portable railway and car ; and to protect his property rights, he 
secured from General Walter Cunningham, the United States mineral 
agent, a permit to occupy for mining purposes the section of land on 
which the bowlder stood. Arriving at the rock, Mr. Eldred was sur- 
prised and chagrined to find it in possession of a party of Wisconsin 
miners under the direction of Colonel Hammond, who had located the 
land under a permit made directly by the Secretary of War to Turner 
and Snyder, and by their agent transferred to Hammond. The only 
thing to do was to buy the rock again, and this Mr. Eldred did, paying 
for it 81,305. 

It took a week for the party of 21 jiersons to get the rock up the 
50-foot hill near the river; then they cat timbers and made a stout 
wooden railway track, placed the rock on the car, and moved it with 
capstan and chains as houses are moved. For four miles and a half, 
over hills 600 feet high, through valleys and deep ravines; through 
thick forests where the path had to be cut; through tangled under- 
brush, the home of pestiferous mosquitoes, this railway was laid and 
the copper bowlder was transported; and when at last the rock was 
lowered to the main stream, nature smiled on the labors of the work- 
men by sending a freshet to carry their heavily laden boat over the 
lower rapids and down to the lake.' 

While arranging transportation to Sault Ste. Marie, Mr. Eldred was 
confronted by an order from the Secretary of War to General Cun- 
ningham directing him to seize the copper rock for transportation to 
Washington. "The persons claiming the rock have no right to it," 
says Secretary Porter, "but justice and equity would require that they 
be amx)ly compensated for the trouble and expense of its removal from 
its position on the Ontonagon to the lake ; and for this purpose Gen- 
eral C. will examine into their accounts and allow them the costs, 
compensating them fully and fairly therefor, the sum, however, not to 
exceed $700. * * * if they set up a claim for the ownership of the 
article itself, that is not admitted or recognized, and their redress, if 
they have any," will be by an application to Congress."^ 



' Jones's letter in New York Herald. I have carefnlly examined the statements 
made by Mr. Alfred Meads in the Ontonagon Miner of June 22, 1895, assigning to 
James Kirk Paul, the founder of the town of Ontonagon, the credit of bringing 
down the rock. Undoubtedly Captain Paul was in the x^f^rty, but the proof is con- 
clusive that all work was done under the direction of Mr. Eldred.

1028 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The sum mentioned by the Secretary being manifestly too small to 
compensate Mr. Eldred "fully and fairly," General Cunningham allowed 
the latter to transport the rock to Detroit, and promised that if the 
curiosity was ordered to Washington, Mr. Eldred should be placed in 
charge of it. On October 11, 1843, the bowlder was landed in Detroit ^ 
aud placed on exhibition for a fee of 25 cents; and among those who 
embraced the opportunity to visit it was Henry R. Schoolcraft, who 
renewed an acquaintance with the copper monarch, formed twenty- 
three years before.^ After less than a month of uninterrupted posses- 
sion. United States District Attorney George C. Bates informed Mr. 
Eldred that the revenue cutter Urie was waiting at Detroit to receive 
the rock for transportation to the capital; and on November 9 the 
bowlder started on its long journey, ' by way of Buffalo, the Erie Canal, 
and New York City, to Georgetown, District of Columbia. Mr. Eldred 
accompanied it as far as New York, and met it at Georgetown with a 
dray, by which it was hauled to the Quartermaster's Bureau of the 
War Department and deposited in the yard, where it remained until 
sometime subsequent to 1855.'' 

Mr. Eldred now appealed to Congress for redress ; and it so happened 
that in the Senate William Woodbridge, of Michigan, was chairman 
of the Committee on Public Lands. An exhaustive report on the sub- 
ject was made at the first session of the Twenty-eighth Congress, and 
three years later, by an act approved January 20, 1847, the Secretary 
of War was authorized "to allow and settle upon just and equitable

Doctor Thomas Wilson, of the National Museum, a second cousin of Cyrus Menden- 
hall, who was one of the early proprietors and workers of copper mines in Lake 
Superior (probably from 1840 to 1855 or 1856), contributes the following informa- 
tion, which is of interest in this connection: ''My uncle, Thomas Mercer, when a 
young man, went from Columbiana County, Ohio, to Lake Superior as an assistant 
to his cousin. In about 1848 he came down from Lake Superior, by way of the 
canal, from Cleveland to Beaver with one of these immense masses of copper. He 
dined en route at my father's house at New Brighton, and in his company after 
dinner I rode with him on the boat as far as Rochester. I remember the appear- 
ance of the nugget of copper very well. It was as large or larger than the one in 
the National Museum, and when I saw the latter, I thought it was the same which I 
had seen on the boat. I learned from my father that the mass which we saw on 
the boat was taken to Pittsburg, under the belief that it would prove of consider- 
able profit to its owners. It turned out to be a loss, however, owing to their 
inability to melt it or to cut it, or in any way divide or separate it into small 
enough pieces to handle. They built a lire over it as it stood in the yard. How 
they then treated it I do not know; nor do I know that, with all this labor, it was 
finally reduced. It brought no profit to the original owners." Dr. Wilson thinks 
that there must have been two or more of thesa large copper nuggets which were 
brought down the lakes from Lake Superior.

terms the accounts of Julius Eldred and sons for their time' ^nd 
exj)enses in purchasing and removing the mass of native copper com- 
monly called the copper rock." The sum thus paid was $5,664.98. 

From the yard of the old War Department to the National Museum 
is not a loug Journey for so traveled a rock, and we need spend no time 
on it. There is, however, another and a really important question as 
to the origin of the bowlder. Accepting the statements of Schoolcraft 
and Doctor Houghton that the coi)j)er rock as found was an isolated 
mass, but that it undoubtedly came from one of the veins in the narrow 
copper belt, let us examine the results of explorations made since 
their day. 

During the winter of 1847-48 Mr. Samuel O. Knapp, the agent of the 
Minnesota mine, observed on the ]jresent location of that mine a curi- 
ous depression in the soil, caused, as he conjectured, by the disintegra- 
tion of a vein. Following up these indications, he came upon a cavern, 
the home of several porcupines. On clearing out the rubbish, he 
found many stone hammers; and at a depth of 18 feet he came upon a 
mass of native copi^er 10 feet loug, 3 feet wide, and nearly 2 feet thick.^ 
Its weight was more than 6 tons. This mass was found resting upon 
billets of oak supported by sleepers of the same wood. There were 
three courses of billets and two courses of sleepers. The wood had 
lost all its consistency, so that a knife blade penetrated it as easily as 
if it had been jjeat; but the earth packed about the copper gave that a 
tirm support. By means of the cobwork the miners had raised the 
mass about 5 feet, or something less than one-quarter of the way to the 
mouth of the pit. The marks of fire used to detach the copper from 
the rock showed that the early miners were acquainted with a process 
used with effect by their successors. This fragment had been pounded 
until every projection was broken off and then had been left, when and 
for what reason is still unknown.^ From similar ints on the same loca- 
tion came ten cart loads of ancient hammers, one of which weighed 39J 
pounds and was fitted with two grooves for a double handle. There 
were also found a copper gad, a copper chisel with a socket in which 
was the remains of a copper handle, and fragments of wooden bailing 
bowls. At the Mesnard mine, in 1862, was found an 18-ton bowlder 
that the "ancient miners" had moved 48 feet from its original bed. 

' In Senate Report 260, Twenty-eighth Congress, first session, Mr. Eldred relates 
his trials and final success. Several of the official communications quoted in this 
article are printed in that report. The existence of the report, however, was devel- 
oped from the communications which were kindly furnished me by Colonel F. C. Ains- 
worth, chief of the Record and Pension Division of the War Department; Captain 
C. T. Shoemaker, chief of the Revenue-Cutter Service, and Honorable T. Strobo 
Farrow, Auditor of the Treasury for the War Department.

1030 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

The fact that growing in the debris of one of these ancient pits was 
a hemlock having 395 annular rings places the date of the excava- 
tions before the days of Columbus. That they were made by a race 
distinct from the present Indians is inferred from the fact that the 
Indians knew nothing of copper in place ; and they had no traditions 
of the ancient copper mines which cover the entire copper belt, and 
which have been to modern miners the best indications of the presence 
of that metal. Within 2 miles of one of these "ancient diggings," 
as they are called, the copper rock was found. 

The question here arises, Was the Ontonagon bowlder detached by 
glacial action and carried southwesterly along the drift to the point 
whence eventually it dropped into the bed of the river ; or is it the 
product of the mining operations of that busy people whose well-built 
boats with each recurring summer in past ages dotted the clear waters 
of Lake Superior, and whose keen search led them to the outcrops of 
copper as well among the iuhospitable thickets of the mainland as on 
the wave-lashed islands of the greatest of lakes? 

Such is the question propounded by Mr. Edwin J. Hulbert, who 
spent the best years of his life in a study of the copper country ; and 
whose recently published work on "The Calumet Conglomerate" 
marks him as the most scientific explorer who ever accomplished great 
results in the Lake Superior copper country. Doubtless the question 
is unanswerable ; but whether nature or man tore the copper rock from 
its original home, it stands to-day as the first considerably shipment of 
copper from the Lake Superior region and the largest mass ever taken 
away from a mine. It is unique also in this: The mines of the Ontona- 
gon region belong to the past. The great Minnesota mine from which 
a 500-ton bowlder, valued at over $200,000, was taken, and whose 
stockholders received $30 for every dollar they i)ut in, has long ago 
been surpassed by the Calumet & Hecla, whose ore contains but an 
insignificant proportion of mass copper. There are no more masses of 
virgin copper to be found ; and the Ontonagon bowlder is not only the 
first, but it is also the last remaining representative of its kind.

Since publishing my " Scientific Taxidermy for Museums,'"^ a num- 
ber of well-known taxidermie artists in tbe museums of America and 
Europe have written me concerning the various methods employed in 
their art in the institutions they represent. There has also been pub- 
lished a work by Mr. Montagu-Browne, entitled •'Artistic and Scien- 
tific Taxidermy and Modeling.-' ^ So far as the criticism of this last 
volume has come to me, it would appear that it has by no means been 
received with favor, either here or upon the Continent. Its main 
defects, however, will be i)ointed out by me in another connection soon, 
and will be only incidentally referred to in the present paper. 

Of all th reports recently received, no one has excited my interest 
more, or apparently contained suggestions of greater positive value, 
than has a MS., illustrated by a large series of photographs, received 
fi'om Mr. H. H. ter Meer, jr., on the staff of and praeparator to the 
Museum of Xatural History, of Leyden, Holland. This communication 
is so full and the photographs so instructive that it commends itself to 
taxidermists at large, and especially to those of this country, where 
the methods in this art are now attracting so much attention. 

For many j'ears Mr. H. H. ter Meer, jr., and his father have been 
engaged on the taxidermical work done in the Leyden Museum, where 
Doctor J. Blittikofer is conservator, and where Doctor Fredericus A. 
Jentick is in charge as director. Judging from the plates in my work 
upon "Scientific Taxidermy for Museum,"' these gentlemen all speak in 
the highest possible terms of the artistic work in this line that has up 
to the present time been accomplished in the U. S. Xational Museum. 
Especial delight is expressed upon examining the achievements in 
modeling the marine invertebrates, and '' the mounting of the fowls, 
pigeons, and parrots," and the wild turkey called forth expressions of 
the most extravagant praise. Among the mammals, the bisons, the

zebra, the tiger, and the rhinoceros, mounted by Jenness Eichardson, 
came iu for the most favorable criticism, and this was given without 

stint. 

It is with no little envy, and with still more regret, that Mr. H. H. ter 
Meer compares the advantageous circumstances under which the finished 
pieces of work are placed upon exhibition at the National Museum, as 
contrasted with what happens to them at Leyden, where the build- 
ing is old, and where "the animals, instead of being placed iu groups, 
are packed away iu a compact throng in dark cases, one animal admir- 
ing the tail of the other." ' 

Further discouragement is experienced from the fact that the Dutch 
biologists filling the more influential positions do not exert themselves, 
either by pen or word, to powerfully promote the art among them. 
There are, further, no organized taxidermical societies iu the country, 
and little or no literature is produced to assist the taxidermic artist. 
Mr. H. H. ter Meer, jr., is a firm believer in and advocate of the higher 
education of taxidermists, as set forth in the aforesaid " Scientific 
Taxidermy for Museums," and he takes occasion to express himself 
very forcibly to that effect. Pleasure is expressed at the fact that the 
American taxidermists are thorouglily alive to the question that the 
day is well past when the workman can hope to produce satisfactory 
results by "stuffing skins of the forms they intend to preserve" instead 
of by the use of the model and the manikin. 

For some years past Mr. H. H. ter Meer has practiced what Kerr, his 
able instructor, had taught him, and with " extraordinary dexterity " 
he sews strips of tow side by side upon the sculptured body of the 
mammal, iu such a manner as to exactly imitate the superficial muscles 
and other parts in the way they occur in nature. Mammals' heads are 
"carved out of peat," and it "does not matter out of what substance 
a mammal is modeled, provided the form is reproduced exactly as it 
would be were the animal alive, and that it is possible to drive pins 
in it without bursting or breaking the artificially prepared body, in 
order to press the skin into the hollows between the muscles." It is 
especially enjoined that the prepared model of the animal's body be 
the exact reproduction of the original, before the skin is drawn over 
it, in order to obviate the necessity of subsequently introducing any 
additional filling between it and the latter. Kerr's methods of imitat- 
ing the superficial anatomical parts require much patience and time 
to learn and successfully practice, and this is apt to discourage many 



' Since the present article was written tlie author has published three articles 
entitled "Taxidermy at the Leyden Museum," and these are illustrated by eleven 
halftone figures, showing the most recent pieces mounted by Mr. ter Meer and his 
father. One of these represent a fine group of jackals, so the charge that no group 
of mounted mammals exists at the Leyden Museum juust now be set aside. Various 
other improvements have also been introduced in the taxidermical department of 
the institution iu question. (See Shootiny and Fishing, XXII, Nos. 8, 9, and 11. New 
York, June 10, 17, July 1, 1897. Pp. 146, 147, 168, 169, 206, and 207.) 



TAXIDERMICAL METHODS IN THE LEYDEN MUSEUM. 1035 

young taxidermists at first, as it did Mr. H. H. ter Meer, but its advan- 
tages are so great when once accomplisbed, that no abandoning there- 
after is ever entertained by the expert. 

My correspondent has succeeded in inventing a material, after years 
of experiment and practice, that possesses the molding properties of 
clay, and that dries with great rapidity and never cracks after once 
setting. I regret to say he has not given his formula for this material, 
so much in demand the world over among taxidermic artists, and I 
kuow of no better encouragement that Mr, H. H. ter Meer can extend 
to his colleagues in the art than a full description of his materials and 
methods, and thus break down the ancient barrier of secrecy, which in 
times paijt has been one of the greatest drawbacks to the progress of 
the art. 

This new material was first employed by him in October, 1894, at 
which time, or shortly after, he modeled the buffalo {Bubalus mindoren- 
sis) shown in Plate 4, figure 2. The material is worked in a thin layer 
over the hollow wooden frame representing the animal's form, even to 
include the head, and the figure shows the result, at the point where 
it is to receive the skin over it. No skull was used, and the entire 
skeleton of this specimen could thus be saved for the Leyden Museum, 
where it is now upon exhibition. 

This being the first attempt with the new material, it naturally pre- 
sents some faults, yet upon the whole the beauty of the model can be 
easily appreciated from the figure, and it possesses the additional 
advantage of being very light. Smaller mammals — the size of a 
domestic cat, for example — are still mounted after the Kerr method, it 
proving the most successful. This new material, and what can be accom- 
plished by its use, has received the approval of Sir William Flower, 
Doctor Bowdler Sharpe, and the distinguished artist, J. G. Keule- 
mans, all of whom visited the museum at Leyden last year, to investi- 
gate the process. Mr. H. H. ter Meer, sr., mounts many of the birds at 
this institution, although the son also exerts his skill in this direction. 
Some of these are beautiful examples of taxidermy, and from the series 
sent me, I select a few, and these are given in my i)lates. Figure 2, of 
Plate 2, is an excellent specimen of Buteo Im/opus, and equally good 
ones are seen in i:»late G, figures 2 and 3 {Botaurus stellaris and Pandion 
haliaetus). It is said that Mr. H. H. ter Meer, sr., makes the artificial 
bodies for his birds in so perfect a manner, that after the skin has been 
placed over it, in any case whatever, he finds it quite unnecessary to 
use "in strapping" either thread or pieces of cardboard to hold the 
feathers in place. This is not even done in either the tail or the wings. 
To show these results, photographs have been sent me of Cyyims olor, 
Oedicnemus crepitans, Buteo vulgaris, Larus ridibundus, and the others 
shown in the plates. They are all fine pieces of work apparently, and 
are especially to be admired for their peculiar lifelike fidelity to the 
originals. 



1036 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

By the aid of his special methods Mr. H. H. ter Meer, jr., has mounted 
some fine mammal pieces, and a number of these are likewise shown in 
the accompanying plates— as, for example, the female and young of 
Simla satyrus (Plate 3, fig. 2, July, 1895), and a still better one, another 
female of the same species (also preserved in July, 1895), and shown 
with its model in Plate 1 and Plate 2, figures 1 and 3. This is one 
of the most admirable and lifelike results that I have ever had the 
pleasure of examining, and stands far ahead of the average mounted 
Simian seen in the cases of the larger museums of the world. At the 
time of its death it was nearly full-growu, and so is a most valuable 
specimen. In April, 1896, the senior H. H. ter Meer mounted the fine 
example of the Macaque [Macacus coninus) shown in Plate 3, figure 1, 
while only a month before that the head of Felts leo, shown in Plate 4, 
figure 1, was i)repared. These talented taxidermists take especial 
pride in their mounted specimen of Ovis tragelaphiis (May, 1896), and 
no less than three photographs of this piece have been submitted to 
me, i^resenting it from different views. Two of these are shown in 
Plate 5 and Plate 6, figure 1. 

Mr. H. H. ter Meer fully agrees with the present writer in the use of 
photographs and sketches as aids to the work of the taxidermic artist, 
and by such means he has fully illustrated the topogTaphical anatomy 
of both the domestic cat and the horse, showing the muscles in various 
positions of the body. In this connection he deplores the scarcity ot 
helpful manuals and text-books in such departments, and holds The Cat, 
by Professor Mivart, and Specht's designs of mammals, as among the 
best that have thus far appeared, and he also speaks of the figures in 
Brehm's "Thierleben" as also extremely useful. 

When at Darmstadt some years ago, he "had an opportunity to 
become acquainted with Mr. Kusthart's method of mammal mounting. 
After having glued large pieces of peat on a frame, he carves [out] like 
a sculptor the whole animal from the peat, and thus obtains excellent 
results, by adjusting the prepared skin over the sculptured body." 
"The gluing of the peat on the frame is, however, a very tedious piece 
of work, but it admits of having the skin subsequently fixed ovesit 
most accurately with pins." My correspondent also comments upon 
the taxidermical methods now coming into vogue in Paris, where they 
cover the hollow wooden frame representing the body of the animal 
with a layer of plaster-of-paris about one-half an inch thick. Some 
tow is used in connection with the frame, and while the plaster is/in a 
soft condition the taxidermist carves out rapidly the form of the ani- 
mal. This method was published last year in V Illustration, and the 
article was illustrated by means of reproductions of photographs, giv- 
ing various stages of the process as applied to a buffalo. Mr. H. H. ter 
Meer says the body was artistically prepared, and exhibited considera- 
ble study, though he doubts that the skin can be fixed into the sulci

for the purpose. 

lu terms most unqualified lie condemns the methods of mammal 
mounting practiced by Mr. Montagu-Browne at the Leicester Museum, 
and described in his recent work. And he is quite correct when he points 
out that it is simply impossible to get the correct form of a large mam- 
mal for the purpose of a model by taking casts in plaster "of its lifeless, 
flayed body." 

The method sees its most useful end in the reproduction of the forms 
of dead animals — not living ones — and as the method is a time- wasting 
and mechanical one, the hand of the skilled taxidermic artist must ever 
be missed in its employment.

THE ANTIQUITY OF THE RED RACE IN AMERICA. 



By Thomas Wilson, 
Curator, Deparfment of Prehistoric Anthropology, I\ S. Xatioual Museum. 



The only discussion in this paper is as to the antiquity of the Indian 
or red race, and this applies only to the aborigines found here by 
Columbus at tlie time of his discovery. No question is involved of 
another or earlier race, by whatever name called, whether mound- 
builder or paleolithic. 

The ancestry of the American race has been variously attributed to 
Semite, Phtenician, and Mongolian races, and, possibly, to a mixture of 
some or all, with many additions. The best of these theories have been 
based only on alleged similarities in characteristics of the Indians and 
their alleged ancestors. 

The argument can be placed on a broader basis; evidence can be 
adduced bearing on more extended propositions and can be applied to 
a larger group of these peoples. 

The preliminary proposition is that the American race of Indians 
is practically the same throughout the entire hemisphere. With all 
their diversity of anatomy and physiology (which diversity, by the way, 
is not greater among Indians than it is among various members of the 
white or black races), they are of the same type, and form but a single 
race. Doctor Brinton gave this as his opinion in his address before the 
Section of Anthropology of the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science at its New York meeting. It is the basis of his book 
on "The American Race." Darwin remarks the close family resem- 
blance between distant tribes in America. Doctor Coleman asserts the 
essential physical identity of the American Indian. Starting, then, 
with this assumption of the identity of race, it is to be argued that it 
began in America in one of two ways — either by evolution from the 
lower animals or by migration as man from other countries. 

In whichever of these ways the red man appeared in America, we 
are entitled to suppose, and may fairly argue, that in the beginning the 
race was here represented by but few individuals. There may have 
been but a single pair, or there may have been a hundred pairs, of 
individuals. Either number will suit the argument. Accepting, then, 
as a fact, the beginning of the red mau in America with a small

1042 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

number of individuals, it follows that they occupied a restricted 
locality. This particular locality may have been ou the east coast or 
on the west coast, may have been north or south. The North Ameri- 
can Indian has been on this hemisphere such a leugth of time that, 
branchiug' out from this little colony in a single locality by ordinary 
procreation, he has so increased in numbers that at the time of the dis- 
covery by Columbus, it is estimated that there were from five to eleven 
millions. 

From the single locality which the small colony originally inhabited, 
it had also extended itself territorially, and had populated pretty equally 
the hemisphere from the Arctic Circle on the north to Terra del Fuego 
on the south, and from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific 
Ocean on the west. 

The first point is, that this increase in number, and this extension in 
territory, required a long period of time, and are proofs of the antiquity 
of the race. 

The confusion of tongues and increase in the number of languages 
among the Indians is another evidence of their antiquity. When the 
first colony of Indians appeared, whether by evolution or migration, tliey 
could have spoken practically but one language. Suppose, in case ot 
migration, thatthey spoke many languages pi-ior to their coming together 
on these, to them, foreign shores, after their arrival they would inevitably 
si)eak but one language. They Avould invent a common language it 
none existed. This would not be difiicult for a colony small in numbers. 
With this for a starting point, we may see what they have done. They 
spread themselves up and down the valleys, across the rivers, and over 
the mountains. While at first they may have retained their communi- 
cation with the parent colony and kept up their original language, it 
continued only while those relations were maintained. When the off- 
spring got so far distant that they did not visit the parent colony and 
had no relation with its members, they invented their own languages, 
different from those of their ancestors, and this continued until they 
became a parent colony, sending forth younger colonies, which, in their 
turn, cut off their relations and invented new languages. So they went 
from east to west, north to south. This continued for such a great 
length of time that, not only had they come at the time of the discov- 
ery to occupy the entire hemisphere, but had also established (according 
to the investigations of the Bureau of Ethnology) not less than two 
hundred separate languages, fifty-two of which belonged to North 
America alone, with dialects and variations innumerable. If we accept 
these facts (and it appears as though we must), the corollary of the 
immensity of the time is inevitable. 

The different cultures among the aborigines or Indians of the West- 
ern Hemisphere in different localities or portions of the country point 
to the same general conclusion. Over all Canada and the United 
States, except the extreme southwest, the culture, or rather the sav-

agery, of tl.e nomadic^ Indians prevailed, which was indicated by their 
principal occupations— war, hunting, and lishmg. 

Yet there are broad lines of demarcation in their culture, the princi- 
pal and best defined of which was the building of mounds and earth- 
works. These monuments, of such great magnitude and extent in 
certain localities in the interior of the United States, did not extend 
over half its territory. The monnds and earthworks were conhned 
between the twenty-fifth and the fifty-first northern parallels of lati- 
tude, and between the sixty-ninth and one hundred and first meridi- 
ans of longitude. The mound-building area had its greatest length 
from Cape Sable, Florida, to Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, and its gTeat- 
est breadth from Point Pema.piid, Maine, to Bismarck, North Dakota. 
No mounds or earthworks are found outside this area. 

The culture of the aborigines occupying Mexico and Central America, 
with the pueblo regions of Arizona and New Mexico, was of a totally 
different character from that in the other regions of North America. 
They were sedentary, agricultural, religious, and highly ceremonial; 
they built immense monuments of the most enduring character the 
outside of the stone walls of some of which were decorated in a high 
order of art, resembling more the great Certosa of Pavia than any 
other monument in Europe. The Teocalh, or mounds of ceremony or 
sacrifice, were immense. The manufacture and use of stone images 
and idols were extensive and surprising to the last degTee Their 
working of iade and the extensive use thereof surpasses that of any 
other localiiy in prehistoric "times. Their pottery excites our wonder 
and admiration; some specimens for their beauty, their elegance of 
form, and their fineness of decoration; other specimens, of idols or 
images, are astonishing on account of tl.e precision of their manufac- 
ture'' and of the difficulty of its accomplishment by hand. 

The culture of Central America, Nicaragua, Yucatan, Costa Kica, 
was as different from that of Mexico as the Mexican was from that of 
the red Indian of the north. The gold ornaments of Chiriqui aud 
Quimbaya are evidence, not simply of a different material, but of a 
different art in working that material. The pottery ot Mexico, Nica- 
ragua and Costa Pica displays such marked differences of kind, form, 
color, decoration, size, and mode of manufacture as to show as much 
difference between the cultures of these countries with a separation 
between them as clearly marked and isolation each from the other as 
between any three countries in modern times. The pottery milk pans 
made in western Ohio and used there by our mothers were not more 
different from the porcelain of Sevres or Meissen or the ware of Delft 
than was the aboriginal pottery of America in different localities. 

The culture of Colombia and Peru in South America tells the same 
story of separation and long-continued isolation, and it finds its con- 
tinuation among the aborigines of the Orinoco, Amazon, La Plata and 
so on south to Patagonia. The isolation of the Patagonians has been 



1044 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. 

continued for such a length of time as that, they have not only main- 
tained a state of brutal savagery peculiar to themselves, but they have 
made a distinct physical or somotological change, amounting not simply 
to a different tribe, but almost to a different race, in that they are the 
tallest people in the hemisphere, and, possibly, in the world. 

Yet with all these differences, physical, technological, and sociological, 
the aborigines of the hemisphere have retained their original character- 
istics so as to stamp them all of one race— blood relations — all belonging 
to the same stock and derived from the same ancestry. With all these 
differences, the principal implements and objects employed by the 
various tribes or peoples in all or any of the countries in the hemi- 
sphere, whether in North or South America, were practically the same, 
thus continuing the evidence of their relationship and early commu- 
nication. The hammerstones, polished stone hatchets, the scrapers, 
spindle whorls, and the great mass of aboriginal implements of stone 
made by chipping or flaking, comprising arrow and spear heads, knives, 
daggers, and poniards, are all so much alike as to show their rela- 
tionship and, consequently, the relationship of the tribes or peoples 
who made them. This being accepted, these immense differences are 
accounted for only by the separation and isolation of certain of the 
tribes of the red men, and this is evidence of their great antiquity and 
long-continued occupation of the country. 

Again, the fixedness of type and the persistence of animal character- 
istics among the red Indians are further evidence. It is an accepted 
anthropological and ethnological fact that the older a race is the more 
deeply seated and permanently fixed become the traits of character in 
its people. This carries with it the correlative proposition that the 
more permanent the characteristics of a race, the better the evidence 
of its antiquity. Applying this rule to the American Indians, we find 
that, with all the diversity claimed, their characteristics are persistent, 
even more than those of the white, the yellow, or the black races, and 
that this includes the physical as well as the mental, moral, and socio- 
logical traits. That the wild Indian is harder to tame than any other 
human animal can only be accounted for on one of two theories — either 
he has greater natural and original individuality, independence, and 
self-reliance, a higher desire for liberty, and a determination to over- 
come all obstacles in the way of maintaining that liberty, or else it is 
the result of persistence through many generations in the condition of 
savagery. Possibly it may be a combination of the two, and the latter 
has produced the former. But in any event the fact remains that the 
American Indian has greater fixity of type and of characteristics than 
have other races, and this indicates, if it does not prove, the long- 
continued and persistent exercise of the comlitions which produced 
these characteristics and, consequently, his high antiquity. 



THE ANTIQUITY OF THE RED RACE IN AMERICA. 1045 

The discovery of America found the nativCvS in that stage of culture 
known in Europe as the neolithic period, or polished stone age. His 
cuttiug implements were of stone and not of metal, and by whatever 
method he shaped or made them, the finishing was by grinding or pol- 
ishing. The similarities of the Indian's culture with that of other 
couutries show that, if he migrated from any of these countries bring- 
ing this culture with him, he did so at a period when they were in the 
neolithic stage. This stage, aud the one subsequent to it, was, in 
the Eastern hemisphere, entirely in prehistoric times, and came to an 
end at an early period. It belonged to the first and second, possibly 
the third, cities of Troy, on the plain of Hissarlik, and came to an end 
before the beginning of culture in (Ireece. When Homer wrote, it had 
passed, not only behind the beginnings of Eome, but behind her j)rede- 
cessors in Italy, the Etruscans. The introduction of bronze into France 
and England, probably 2,000 years B. O., sounded the death knell of 
the neolithic period and was the beginning of its end in those countries. 
In Asia the historical evidence shows even an earlier cessation of the 
neolithic period. The period of the Chinese civilization carries us back 
much farther, and shows the people of that country to have passed 
beyond the neolithic or polished stone age ranch earlier. Now the occu- 
piers of American soil were emigrants from some, or, possibly, all of 
the countries mentioned, but, whichever it may have been, the emigra- 
tion must have taken place during the neolithic age, and not after its 
close. Western Europe was the latest country in which the neolithic 
l)eriod came to a close and was succeeded by the age of bronze. So 
the commencement of the age of bronze in Europe aflbrds a supposi- 
titious mark in the history of our country as the latest date at which 
the neolithic migration to America could have taken place. How much 
earlier it might have been, is a matter of speculation. 

These arguments, based upon facts which appear indisputable, go to 
show that the migration by which the American race came to occupy 
the Western Hemisphere could not have been less than two thousand 
years prior to the Christian era, but that, if they came from other 
countries, they might have come a long time before.
