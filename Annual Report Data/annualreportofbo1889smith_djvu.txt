REPORT 

UPON THE CONDITION \NI> PROGRESS OF THE U, S. NATIONAL MUSEUM 
DURING THE FISCAL FEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1889, 



By (i. Brown Goode, 

tssistani Secretary Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U. S. National Museum. 



A.— ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM. 

The National Museum is under the charge of the. Smithsonian In- 
stitution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Eegents of 
the Institution. 

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the keeper of 
the collections. 

In the act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian Institution are 
contained the following provisions concerning the scope of the museum 
to be placed under its charge: 

(1) The law specifies certain classes of objects which shall come 
into the custody of the Institution, viz: All objects of art; all objects 
of foreign and curious research (/. e. f ethnological collections); all 
objects of natural history; all plants; all geological and mineralog- 
ical specimens belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States, 
which may be in the city of Washington — including the "National 
Cabinet of Curiosities," at that time in one of the halls of the Patent 
Ofiice building — in whosesoever custody they may be. 

(2) It provides that in proportion as suitable arrangements can be 
made for their reception these objects shall be delivered to such per- 
sons'as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive them. 

{'■>) It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so 
classed as best to facilitate their examination and study. 

(4) It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building to be 
inclosed for the institution. 

(5) It authorizes the Regents to obtain new specimens, by exchange 
Of duplicate specimens, and by gift, and directs thai they shall be also 
appropriately classed and arranged. 

(6) It constitutes the Secretary of the Smithsonian institution the 
keeper of the museum.

4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF COLLECTIONS. 

The collections of the Museum are made up, in large part, of the fol- 
lowing materials : 

(1) The natural history and anthropological collections accumulated 
since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution. 

(2) The collections of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the Perry ex- 
pedition to Japan, and other naval expeditious. 

(3) The collections of the scientific officers of the Pacific Railroad 
survey, the Mexican boundary survey, and of the surveys carried on by 
the Engineer Corps of the Army. 

(4) The collections of the United States geological surveys under the 
direction of the United States geologists, Hayden, King, and Powell. 

(5) The collections of the U. S. Fish Commission. 

(G) The gifts by foreign Governments to the Museum or to the Pres- 
ident or other public officers of the United States, who are forbidden by 
law to retain such gifts in their private possession. 

(7) The collections made by the United States to illustrate the ani- 
mal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethuology of the na- 
tive races of the country, on the occasion of the International Exhibi- 
tion at Philadelphia in 1876, and the fishery collections displayed by 
the United States in the International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin 
in 1880 and at London in 1883. . 

(8) The collections given by the Governments of the several foreign 
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at Phila- 
delphia. 

(9) The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing and 
commercial houses of Europe and America, at the time of the Phila- 
delphia Exhibition and subsequently. 

(10) The material received in exchange for duplicate specimens 
from the museums in Europe and America, at the time of the Phila- 
delphia Exhibition and subsequently. 

B.— SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR. 

CLASSIFIED SERVICE OF THE MUSEUM. 

A schedule representing the present actual needs of the service was, 
in response to a Senate resolution, submitted by the Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution. By this it was shown that the sum of $200,000 
at least was required to pay the salaries of the necessary scientific 
assistants, the clerical force, mechanics, and laborers, for the construc- 
tion of suitable cases, and for the employes connected with the heating, 
lighting, electrical, and telephonic service. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5 

A COLLECTION OF BUSTS OF STATE GOVERNORS IN I860. 

A collection of thirty-two busts, including oue of James Buchanan, 
has been presented to the Museum by Mrs. Anna E. Douglass. The 
busts were executed by Mr. Henry Dexter, of Cambridge. After the 
series was completed in plaster, it was placed on exhibition in the Doric 
Hall of the State House at Boston. The lapse of time and the celeb- 
rity of several of the governors have made this collection of great value 
from an historical stand-point. It is also probable that the sculptor's 
efforts indicate the best work of the kind produced in the United States 
up to the year 18G0. 

AERONAUTIC COLLECTION. 

It is intended to establish in the Museum a Department of Aero- 
nautics, in which will be established (1) balloons and apparatus lighter 
than air, and (2) models of aerostats heavier than air. The cooperation 
of the Aeronautic Society of Great Britain has been invited by the 
Secretary of the Institution, who is especially interested in the subject. 

INCREASE OF THE COLLECTIONS. 

A careful estimate of the number of specimens in all the departments 
of the Museum places the total at 2,804,244. In 1882 the total was 
estimated at about 192,000. At that time, however, some of the largest 
collections in the Museum, such as the ethnological collection, had not 
been brought under control, and no estimate of their extent was then 
possible ; so that the difference between the totals for 1882 and 1889 
can not be accounted for solely by the number of specimens received 
during these years, but includes also the material which was already 
in the possession of the Museum, but which had not been classified at 
the time of the first census of the collections in 1882„ 

AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The American Historical Association was founded in 1884 for the pro- 
omotiou of historical studies, for the collection and preservation of his- 
torical manuscripts, and lor kindred purposes in the interest of Amer- 
ican history. By an act of Congress approved January 4, 1889, the 
regents of the Smithsonian Institution are authorized to permit the 
American Historical Association to deposit its collections, manuscripts, 
books, etc., in the keeping of the Smithsonian Institution. Under this 
Act the American Historical Association reports annually to the Secre- 
tary of the Smithsonian Institution concerning its proceedings and the 
condition of historical study in America. 

VISITORS DURING INAUGURATION SEASON. 

On March 2 and 5 the Museum and Smithsonian buildings were vis- 
ited by 100,075 people. 



6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

CINCINNATI EXPOSITION. 

The Exposition closed on November 8, 1888. The appropriation 
available for the use of the Museum was $40,000. The space occu- 
pied by the Museum exhibits was 12,000 square feet. Sixteen depart- 
ments of the Museum prepared exhibits. The total attendance at the 
Exposition was 1,055,276, the daily average being 9,593. 

TRANSFER OF DISBURSEMENT OF MUSEUM APPROPRIATIONS. 

A statement relating to this matter is made on page 20 of the report 
for last year. Congress has sanctioned the proposed transfer, and the 
Museum appropriations will henceforth be disbursed under the direc- 
tion of the Smithsonian Institution. 

FORMATION OF A FORESTRY COLLECTION. 

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of Agriculture Dr. B. E Fer- 
now, Chief of the Forestry Division of the Department of Agriculture, 
has accepted the charge of the Section of Forestry in the National Mu- 
seum. The Section of Forestry was established in April, 1889. 



C— THE CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS. 

INCREASE OF THE COLLECTIONS. 

The total number of specimens as estimated in the appended table 
is now not far from three millions. The increase during this year is 
much smaller than in any previous year since the completion of the 
Museum building. At the close of 1882 there were about 192,000 speci- 
mens in the collections. The increase during 1883 was about 170,000; 
during 1884, more than 1,200,000. It was during this year that the 
extent of the ethnological collection was first estimated and also of the 
collections of mollusks, insects, aboriginal pottery, birds' eggs, reptiles 
and batrachians, and mesozoic fossils. During 1885 no estimate was 
made, this being the year when the fiscal year was adopted in place of 
the calendar year, and the report for 1885 covered only six months. 
In 1886 a careful estimate showed a further increase of about 950,000. 
In 1887 the increase was nearly 250,000, and in 1888 nearly 140,000. 
The increase during the fiscal year covered by this report is only 
00,000. This may be accounted for to a large degree by the fact that, 
the exhibition halls and storage rooms being filled to their utmost ca- 
pacity, it has become necessary to cease to a large degree the cus- 
tomary efforts for the increase of the collections. 

In order that the tabulated results here presented may not be mis- 
leading, it is proper to repeat what has elsewhere been alluded to, 
namely, that the classification of some of the largest collections, such as 



REPORT OP ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 



the ethnological collection, had not been made in 1882, and that there- 
fore no figures appear under the head of ethnology for that year or for 
1883, although the ethnological collection was at that time probably 
half as large as it is now. Some of the other collections had not been 
classified, and thus an increase in the collections more apparent than 
real appears to have taken place in 1885-'86.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



MUSEUM CATALOGUES.* 

The following exhaustive account of the manuscript catalogues of 
the Museum has been prepared by Mr. Randolph I. Geare : 

The catalogue system of the Museum was devised and commenced 
in April, 1839, by Professor Baird, at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, while en- 
gaged in work upon his private collection of birds. The book in which 
the specimens in this collection were recorded is now Vol. 1 of the Bird 
Catalogue, and is in the custody of Mr. Ridgway, Curator of Birds. 

When Professor Baird became Assistaut Secretary of the Smith- 
sonian Institution in 1850, he brought with him ami presented to the Na- 
tional Museum his private collection of birds, and a large general nat- 
ural history collection, tilling an entire baggage car. The bird collection 
was catalogued between 1839 and 1848. 

After Professor Baird accepted the position of Assistant Secretary 
of the Smithsonian Institution, his system of cataloguing was adopted 
for the Government collections. 

When the cataloguing of the Museum specimens was commenced, it 
was found more convenient to keep the records of the several collec- 
tions in one book. For many years all objects other than specimens of 
natural history were entered in the "Ethnology " series. Vol. xi of this 
series is the first that was set apart for the entry of material of a 
specified character, and in it are recorded materia medica specimens. 
Musical instruments, fishery implements, foods, textiles, and other 
classes of specimens are also included in this volume. A catalogue for 
mineral and metallurgical specimens was opened in 1859, for fossils in 
1859, for vertebrate specimens in 1840, for birds in 1839, for mammals 
in 1852, for mollusks in 1859. This early system of cataloguing was, 
although not entirely satisfactory, under the circumstances necessary; 
but during later years every special collection has been provided with its 
own catalogue book, and in some instances the curators have found it con- 
venient to assign a different book to the several groups of objects un- 
der their custody. The total number of catalogue books in the Museum, 
entirely or partly filled, is 151, as shown in the following enumeration:

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9 

The history of the system of cataloguing in the various departments 
is given in the following detailed statement: 

CATALOGUES OF THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

ETHNOLOGICAL SERIES. 

This series contains thirty-one volumes, with 150,400 entry spaces. 
The earlier volumes were devoted to the entry of all objects accruing 
to the Museum other than objects of natural history. 

From time to time separate volumes or portions of volumes have 
been set apart for the entry of material of a specified character. 

Vol. I, Nos. 1 to 3500. — The first material entered bears date of 
March 9, 1850, and is a collection of Japanese ethnological objects, pre- 
sented by the Emperor of Japan, through Commodore Perry. 

The last entry is dated February 4, 1867.* 

Vol. II, Nos. 3501 to 8300. — This volume covers the period between 
February, 18G7, and February, 1869. Many of its pages are devoted 
to the entry of material gathered by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition. 
The entries have not been carried beyond 8277, from 8278 to 8300, 
both inclusive, having been left for some reason blank.* 

Vol. Ill, Nos. 8301 to 14100.— This volume covers the period be- 
tween February, 1869, and June, 1874.* 

Vol. IV, Nos. 14101 to 19825. — This volume covers the period be- 
tween June, 1874, and March, 1875.* 

Vol. V,Nos. 19826 to 24750. — This volume covers the period between 
March, 1875, and September, 1876.* 

Vol. VI, Nos. 24751 to 29700.— The first entry in the volume is dated 
October, 1875— a year prior to the last entry in Vol. V, and the vol- 
ume was completed a year subsequent to the opening of Vol. VII, the 
next of this series. This volume was probably set apart for the use of 
some collector in the field.* 

Vol. VII, Nos. 29701 to 34600.— This volume covers the period be- 
tween September, 1876, and January, 1879.* 

Vol. VIII, Nos. 34601 to 39500. — This volume covers the period be- 
tween January, 1879, and January, 1880.* 

Vol. IX, Nos. 39501 to 44350. — This volume covers the period between 
January, 1880, and December, 1880.* 

Vol. N, Nos. 4 1351 to 49225. — This volume covers the period between 
December, 1880, and January, 1881.* 

In A'ol. x is the following note : 

The two succeeding volumes <>f record are devoted (1) to collections under the 1 T . 
S. Fish Commission and (2) to chemical and other artificial products. 

Vol. XL — This volume, the first of the series set apart for the entry 
of material of a specified character, was assigned to Dr. Flint for the

entry of specimens of materia niedica. It covers the period between 
May, 1881, and February, 1886. The entries in this volume have been 
carried as far as 54050, although the limit provided for is No. 53925 ; 
thus duplicating to the extent of about one hundred aud twenty-five 
numbers the entries in Vol. xn. This volume is in the custody of the 
Section of Materia Medica.* 

Vol. XII, Nos. 53926 to 57950.— From January, 1881, to February, 
1883. Assigned as follows: From 53926 to 54750 is devoted to the 
entry of general ethnological objects except the following : Nos. 53926 
to 54015. A collection of Japanese plants, from the University of Tokyo ; 
entered in July, 1881. This portion of the catalogue has been used in 
the Section of Fisheries. 

Nos. 54016 to 54079 embrace a collection of Chinese musical instru- 
ments from the Chinese Imperial Centennial Commission, and others. 
These entries were made in December, 1881. This portion of the cata- 
logue has been used in the Section of Fisheries. The entry of musical 
instruments has been continued in Vol. xx of this series. 

Nos. 54080 to 54302 are devoted to the entry of general ethnological 
objects. This portion of the catalogue has been used in the Section of 
Fisheries. 

Nos. 54303 to 54525 are dev.oted to the entry of a large collection of 
fishing implements, models of fishing boats, etc. This material was 
entered in November, 1882, and was the nucleus of the fisheries collec-

REPTILE AN'1> BA.TRACHIAN SERIES. 

Cataloguing in this department was commenced in 1850. This cata- 
logue consists of four volumes. 

Vol. [, from 1 to 2900, covers the period between January, 1850, and 
July, 1858. 

Vol. ci, from 2901 to 7875, covers the period between July, 1850, and 
March, 1ST.;. 

Vol. in, from 7870 to 13885, March, 1873, to October, 1884. 

Vol. IV, is now in use. On January 20, 1890, the entries had been 
carried as far as 15619 — to the end of June, 1889, to 15523. 

INSECT SERIES. 

The Department of Insects has a special catalogue in which are 
recorded all the additions to the collections since May^ 18, 1883. A 
single entry may include several hundred specimens. Up to the end 
of June, 1889, 180 entries had been made. No attempt has been made 
to affix catalogue numbers to the immense amount of material belong- 
in g to the Department of Agriculture. The material has been classified 
according to relationship, the several orders, families, genera, etc., be- 
in- kept in separate trays. The force of this department is now en- 
gaged in the preparation of a catalogue based on relationship, in which 
will" be indicated the number of examples of each species in the Museum 
collection. 

BOTANICAL SERIES. 

As has already been stated in connection with Vol. xn of the Eth- 
nology series, Nos. 53926 to 51015 of that volume were taken up in 
cataloguing (July, 1881) a collection of Japanese plants received from 
the University of Tokyo. This is the first collection of plants eutered 
under a consecutive scries of numbers. 

RECENT PLANT SERIES. 

In 1808 the Herbarium of the Smithsonian Institution, already of 
great extent and value, which had for many years been under the care 
of Dr. John Torrey in New York City, was placed under the care of 
the Department of Agriculture, with the understanding that the 
appointment of the Botanist of the Department of Agriculture (to be 
charged with its administration) should be subject to the approval of 
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Constant additions have 
been made to the Herbarium since that time by the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, and the collection has been also greatly increased through special 
efforts made by the Botanist of the Department of Agriculture and his 
assistants. 






20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

In 1881, when Prof. Lester F. Ward took charge of the collection of 
fossil plants in the Museum, he found that the separation of the fossil 
plants from the recent plants caused him much inconvenience in con- 
nection with the identification of the former. Since that time, there- 
fore, it has been customary to retain in the Museum such accessions of 
recent plants as were needed by Professor Ward and other students in 
connection with their paleo-botanical work. A second collection of 
recent plants has thus been formed in the Museum building. It became 
evident that the existence of two herbaria, each a part of the National 
Herbarium, and each entirely separate in administration from the other, 
was undesirable. Dr. George Vasey, Botanist of the Department of 
Agriculture, has therefore, at the request of the Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution, and with the consent of the Secretary of Ag- 
riculture, accepted the position of Honorary Curator of the National 
Herbarium. The Secretary of Agriculture has also agreed to the prop- 
osition of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution that, as soon as 
proper accommodation can be afforded to the National Herbarium in 
one of the buildings of the National Museum, the portion of the Her- 
barium now in the Department of Agriculture may be transferred and 
combined with the collection now in the Museum building. 

In Dr. Vasey's report covering the remainder of the fiscal year (March 
1 to June 30, 1889,) he states that no catalogue of the plants contained 
in the Herbarium has yet been made, but that they are properly ar- 
ranged in orders, genera, and species, and are labeled so as to be read- 
ily accessible. 

In March, 1889, the catalogue of recent plants received in the Na- 
tional Museum, contained 175 entries. No idea, however, of the extent 
of the collection can be formed by this statement, since the first two 
entries comprised 25,000 specimens, these representing the Ward and 
Joad collections. With the beginning of the fiscal year 1889-1890 a 
new catalogue will be opened by Dr. Vasey for the entry of recent 
plants. 

FOSSIL PLANT SERIES. 

The cataloguing of fossil plants was first systematically commenced 
in the year 1881 (?) by Prof. Leo Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio. 

Several entries of fossil plants are found in the early volumes of 
the " Fossil Series " of catalogues. 

There is an extra catalogue kept, in which is entered the material 
that had accumulated in the interval between the time at which 
Professor Lesquereux discontinued the work of cataloguing and the 
period at which it was resumed by Mr. Knowltou. This catalogue is 
only provisional, the specimens when identified being re-entered in the 
regular catalogue of the department. 

GRAPHIC ART SERIES. 

The Section of Graphic Arts has a special catalogue, in which up to 
January 7, 1890, 3,233 entries had been made. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21 

FOOD .\M> TEXTILE SERIES. 

In tin' custody of this department arc two volumes of a special cata- 
logue. In these, special series <>f numbers have beeo set apart for the 
various kinds of material placed in the department. The two volumes 
contain about 9,900 numbers, about two-thirds of which have thus far 
been utilized. It will be observed that a part of Vol. xn of the Eth- 
nology series (Nos. 54751 to 55550) is devoted to the entry of a collection 
of foods and other specimens. This appears to have been the first set 
of numbers devoted to the cataloguing of this material. 

TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING SERIES. 

To this section a special catalogue has been assigned. The first en- 
try is dated March 10, 1885, and has reference to the locomotive "John 
Bull," the gift of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Up to the end 
of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889, 125 entries had been made. In 
this section the work of cataloguing has never been carried on system- 
atically, owing to the pressure of other work. 

LIVING ANIMAL SERIES. 

This department has a special catalogue. The first entry is in Octo- 
ber, 1887. On June 30, 1889,341 entries had been made. 

FORESTRY SERIES. 

The cataloguing of specimens in the forestry collection has not yet 
been commenced. 

CATALOGUE ENTRIES DUEING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1889. 

A catalogue entry, as explained in previous reports, may relate to a 
single specimen or to several hundred or even several thousand speci- 
mens, as frequently happens in regard to mollusks, plants, marine in- 
vertebrates, fossil and other groups of objects. The total number of 
entries made by the curators of the several departments in the Museum 
catalogne books during the year is 23,442, as shown in the accompany- 
ing table:

ARRANGEMENT OF COLLECTIONS AND ASSIGNMENT OF SPACE. 

The development of the collection of objects illustrating the graphic 
arts has been so rapid that it has been found necessary to enlarge the 
limits of the space assigned for its display. In 1888 one-half of the 
northwest rauge was assigned to this collection. During the year it 
has been found necessary to devote the entire range to the Section of 
Graphic Arts, the casts of Mexican sculptures having been removed to 
the Smithsonian building. The east side of the northwest range is de- 
voted to the technical collection, and on the west side are shown the 
methods of drawing and painting and the historical collection of relief 
engravings, intaglio engravings, and lithographs. Mr. Koehler in his 
report discusses at some length the need of additional space, in view 
of the fact that the space now provided is not sufficient for the installa- 
tion of the material already on hand. 

Mr. J. E. Watkins, Curator of Transportation and Engineering, has 
re-arranged the collection under the following classes: (1) Objects 
and implements for burthen-bearing by man and animals ; (li) Objects 
and implements of human and animal traction (street railway cars ex- 
cepted); (3) Originals, models, and drawingsof stationarysteamengines; 
(4) Originals, models, and drawings of locomotives ; (5) Models and 
drawings of passenger-freight cars ; (0) Originals, models, and drawings 
illustrating the development of the American rail and track ; (7) Models, 
relics, and drawings showing the beginnings of the steam-boats and 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 2."» 

development of marine steam engineering; (8) Maps, showing bhe be 
ginning and extension of the American railway system ; (9) Electrical 
machine; (10) Airships, etc. In view of the progress which has been 
made in solving - problems that have arisen in connection with electric 
propulsion, both on land and water, during the last few years, it would 
seem proper to begin to collect objects illustrating the early history of 
the devices which have gradually been developed into the motors, etc., 
now practically successful and in commercial use. 

In February space was assigned to the Section of Oriental Antiqui- 
ties on the north side of the west hall, and Dr. Cyrus Adler, Assistant 
Curator, has commenced the installation of specimens. 

In April a section devoted to forestry collections was organized. Dr. 
B. E. Fernow, chief of the forestry division in the Department of Agri- 
culture, has been appointed Honorary Curator. He has proposed the 
following classification for the exhibition series of specimens : 

(1) Relation of forestry to other industries and conditions of life; 
(2) Description of the objects upon which forestry is to be applied, and 
of the raw material; (3) Methods of utilization and application; (4) 
Methods of production and management; (5) Bibliography. A few 
objects have already been placed on exhibition on a panel 12 feet by 14 
feet. These are described in Dr. Fernow's report.* 

The materia medica collection is installed in the southeast range 
of the Museum, and occupies a floor space of about 1,G00 square feet. 

The collection comprises the following exhibits : 

(1) Medicinal forms ; to illustrate the forms in which medicinal sub- 
stances appear in commerce or are prepared for administration by the 
pharmacist. 

(2) Officinal drugs. The crude medicinal articles, and their deriva- 
tives, authorized by the pharmacopoeias, including non-official varieties 
of official drugs; the whole arranged under the following heads: 

Animal Products. Vegetable Products. Organic Chemical Prod- 
ucts. Inorganic Products. Mineral Waters and their constituents. 
Indigenous, or Domestic Drugs. Medicines of the North American 
Indians. Mexican Drugs. West Indian Drugs. South American 
Drugs. East Indian Drugs. Chinese, Japanese, and Corean Medi- 
cines. 

In the Department of Ethnology has been organized a collection of 
charts, maps, lay figures, busts, portraits, and photographs, designed 
to illustrate the spread of various types of mankind. Professor .Mason, 
the Curator of this department, has also prepared an ethnographical 
collection illustrating the arts and industries of the Koloshan, Eaidan, 
and Tsimshian stocks of Indians, based upon the report of Ensign A. 
P. Niblack upon the Coast Indians of Alaska, published in the Museum 
report for 18S.S. Mr. Walter Hough, of this department, has brought

together ami arranged in the exhibition hall a series of thefire-inakiug 
tools of most of the American aborigines. The Curator has extended 
his studies on the subject of human transportation.* 

Mr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of Prehistoric Anthropology, has pro- 
posed a re-arrangement of the exhibition hall on the second floor of the 
Smithsonian building. His plans are set forth in his report.t 

Mr. True. Curator of Mammals, has continued the work of arranging 
the hall under his charge. Groups of prairie dogs and opossums have 
been thus treated during the year. Several special cases have been 
constructed for this department. Some important changes in the ar- 
rangement of the exhibition series have been effected. These are ex- 
plained in detail in the report of the Curator. 

The systematic arrangement of special bird exhibits has been accom- 
plished by Mr. Eobert Eidgway, Curator. These are descri bed at length 
in his report.t The arrangement of the collection of skins is considered 
by Mr. Eidgway to be exceedingly unsatisfactory, on account of the 
lack of storage room. An apartment in the south tower has been as- 
signed to this department. 

Capt. Charles E. Bendire, Curator of Birds' Eggs, has continued the 
arrangement of the reserve series and also of the series of eggs of for- 
eign birds. 

A thorough re- arrangement of the entire collection of reptiles and 
batrachians has been found necessary, and Dr. Leonhard Stejueger, 
Curator, has already made a beginning with the reserve series of North 
American species. Lack of proper accommodations necessarily ren- 
ders any work of this kind slow and difficult. 

The collection of fishes is very inadequately provided for. Dr. T. H. 
Beau, Curator, states that it has become necessary to place the 
jars containing the specimens on the floor, thereby putting them in 
danger of being broken, and causing much extra labor and confusion. 

Mr. William H. Dall, Curator of Mollusks, has arranged for exhibi- 
tion the Lea collection of Unionidw, and he hopes to be able to com- 
plete during the summer the arrangement of this magnificent collection 
of fresh water mussels. 

In the Department of Insects there has been unusual activity in the 
arrangement and preparation of collections for exhibition. Work upon 
a general exhibition collection to be permanently placed iu the Museum 
has been carried on. An additional laboratory has been completed for 
the use of this department by the construction of a room over the Pub- 
lic Comfort room. The arrangement of the reserve collection is pro- 
gressing. The rearrangement of the Coleoptera has been continued, 
and the family Oarabidse has been entirely re-arranged, occupying sixty- 
eight boxes in the reserve collection and eighteen double boxes in the 
duplicate series.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 25 

Mr. Richard Rathbuu, Curator of Marine [nvertebrates, has care 
fully examined the alcoholic <-s>ll**t-t m*ii, and has arranged in systematic 
order the crustaceans, worms, holothurians, ophinrans, crinoids, liy- 
droids, molluscoids, and sponges. It is his intention to bestow the 
same care upon the other groups during next year. Fie has also found 
time to revise the collection of duplicate specimens. Mr. Bathbun re- 
ports the entire collection to be in an excellent state of preservation, 
and available for reference or study. 

Definite plans for the formation of an exhibition series of anatomical 
preparations of soft parts of specimens have been prepared by Mr. True, 
Acting Curator of Comparative Anatomy. It has, however, been 
found necessary to postpone the execution of this plan uutil next year. 
The large wall ease in the exhibition hall of this department has been 
enlarged by the addition of a wing extending toward the west. This 
has made possible an improvement in the arrangement of the mounted 
skeletons of Primates and Carnivores. The arrangement of the collec- 
tion of Vertebrate Fossils has occupied a considerable portion of the 
time of the Curator and of Mr. Lucas, Assistant Curator. 

Mr. C. D. Walcott, Curator of Paleozoic Fossils, has, on account of 
his work as paleontologist of the Geological Survey, been unable to 
devote much time to the arrangement of the Museum collection. The 
space allotted to the exhibition series of this department is now nearly 
filled. The arrangement is, however, in a large measure provisional, 
and will require modification. Mr. R. R. Gurley has commenced the 
arrangement of the graptolites. It is Mr. Walcott's intention to arrange 
as soon as possible the large series of Lower and Middle Cambrian 
fossils which he has collected from Newfoundland. 

Dr. C. A. White, Curator of Mesozoic Fossils, states that the collec- 
tions under his care are in better shape than they have ever been be- 
fore. Early in the year 1889 this department was furnished with ten 
glass top frames. These are now filled with specimens consisting 
chiefly of types of species, descriptions of which have been published in 
the reports of the U. S. Geological Survey. 

The Herbarium is under the care of Dr. George Vasey, Botanist 
of the Department of Agriculture. He states in his report that the 
collection of herbarium specimens in the Department of Agriculture, 
forming a part of the National Herbarium, is exhibited in wall cases, 
occupying a space of about 85 running feet. This collection is mounted 
on 120,000 sheets. These are arranged according to orders, genera, 
and species, and are readily accessible. Then; are still a large quantity 
of specimens to be mounted and aoded to the collection, besides a great 
number of duplicates for distribution and exchange. 

The collection of building and ornamental stones, as now installed, 
tills thirteen door screen cases, one wall case, two pyramids, and the 
tops of three table cases. The collections of rock and rock-forming 
minerals are arranged on one pier case and seven slope-top table-cases. 



26 REFORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The systematic arrangement of the collections of dynamic and historical 
geology has not yet been commenced, owing to the lack of cases. 

The entire southwest court is now reserved for the exhibition series 
of metals and ores. The space is still insufficient for the proper exhi- 
bition of the collection, and it has been found necessary to withdraw 
fully one-third of the specimens intended for exhibition, and divide them 
between the reserve and duplicate series. 

The wooden structure adjoining the Smithsonian building on the 
south has become so overcrowded with specimens of living animals that 
numerous offers of additional specimens have necessarily been declined. 

A room for tropical reptiles, quadrupeds, and other animals has been 
added. 

The establishment of a National Zoological Park has been authorized 
by Congress, and the specimens now exhibited in this wooden shed will 
doubtless be removed to the park as soon as the necessary arrange- 
ments for their reception shall have been completed. 

During the month of May the general storage room was removed 
from the Armory building, to make room for the offices of the IT. S. 
Fish Commission, to the storage shed, west of the Armory building, 
and the storage separated into three sections. 

D.— THE MUSEUM STAFF. 

The staff of the National Museum includes two classes, scientific and

with the consent of the Secretary of Agriculture, Dr. 15. E. Fernow, 
chief of the forestry Division of the Department of Agriculture has 
been appointed curator of the collection. 



28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

On April 5 Mr. L. O. Howard, of the Entomological Division of the 
Department of Agriculture, was appointed Acting Curator of iusects 
during the absence of Professor Riley, Honorary Curator, in Europe. 

On April 21 Mr. F. II. Knowlton, Assistant Curator of fossil plants, 
was furloughed for one year without pay, in order to enable him to 
prosecute some special botanical work, and to serve upon the editorial 
staff of the Century Dictionary. Mr. Knowlton has, however, kindly 
offered to continue assisting in the care of the collections until an 
appointment has been made. 

Dr. H. C. Yarrow, who for many years has served as Honorary 
Curator of the Department of Reptiles, resigned on February 9, and 
Dr. Leouhard Stejneger, Assistant Curator of birds, was on March 1 
appointed Curator of the Department of Reptiles. 

Dr. George Vasey, botanist of the Department of Agriculture, was 
appointed honorary Curator of botany in March, and in that capacity 
controls the botanical collections in the National Museum and in the 
Department of Agriculture forming the National Herbarium. Prof. 
Paul Haupt, Honorary Curator of the Section of Oriental Antiquities, 
has been designated representative of the Smithsonian Institution at 
the Eighth International Congress of Orientalists, to meet in Stockholm 
and Christiania from September 2 to 13. Prof. Otis T. Mason has been 
detailed to visit the principal ethnological museums in France, Ger- 
many, Denmark, and England for the purpose of making arrangements 
i for exchange of specimens and incidentally of studying the methods of 
installation adopted in them. Mr. Thomas Wilson will also visit the 
principal archaeological museums in France for similar purposes, and 
will attend the meetings of the International Anthropological Congress. 

Mr. J. B. Smith, Assistant Curator of the Department of Insects, 
resigned in April to accept a professor 'ship in Rutger's College, New 
Brunswick, New Jersey, and the position of entomologist of the State 
Agricultural Experiment Station, and Mr. Martin Linell has been 
appointed aid in this Department. 

THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. 

The administrative affairs of the Museum are under the direct charge 
of the Assistaut Secretary. The arrangement of the administrative of- 
fices is as follows : 

Department of accounts, W. V. Cox, chief clerk. 

Department of correspondence and reports, R. I. Geare, executive clerk. 

Department of registry ami storage, S. 0. Brown, registrar. 

Department of property and supplies, J. Elfreth Watkins, engineer of property. 

Department of publications, A. Howard Clark, editor of Proceedings and Bulletin. 

The care of the buildings, the supervision of the mechanics, watchmen, laborers, 
and cleaners, and many related matters, are under the charge of Mr. Henry Horau, 
superintendent of buildings. Mr. C. A. Steuart is assistant superintendent. 

The preparation and mounting of specimens for the exhibition series consumes the 
timo of several skilled employe's. Casts of specimens have often to be made, when 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETAR1 29 

the original objects can uot be retained in the Museum. Protograpbs of objects not 
infrequently supply the place of the object itself in the exhibition cases. The work 
i nc i denial to such preparation is now of great import a nee and a department or prep- 
aration has been formed as here indicated : 

Department of preparation: Taxidermists, W. T. Hornaday in charge, Joseph Pal-

CLASSIFID SERVICE OF THE MUSEUM. 

In response to a resolution* of the Senate asking for a schedule of the 
classified service of the officers and employes of the National Museum, 
the Secretarv of the Smithsonian Institution addressed the following 
letter to the Hon. John J. Ingalls, president pro tempore of the Senate, 
transmitting a schedule which, upon very careful consideration, seemed 
to represent the actual needs of the service. 

* U. S. Senate, October 9, 1888. 

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

# # * 

Mr. Wilson, of Iowa. I offer the following resolution, and ask for its present consid- 
eration : 

Resolved, That the Regents and Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and Di- 
rector of the United States National Museum be, and hereby are, directed to formulate 
and transmit to the Senate at their earliest convenience, a schedule of classified serv- 
ice of the officers and employes of the National Museum, arranged according to duty 
and salary, as the same is required for the proper working of the Museum. 

Mr. Hoar. From what committee does that come .' 

Mr. Wilson, of Iowa. From none. It is a resolution that I introduced in order to 
get the information. 

Mr. Hoar. I should like to inquire for information — I have no doubt it is all right 
— have we authority to impose directions on the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion and the Director of the National Museum .' 

Mr. Wilson, of Iowa. The resolution relates mainly to the National Museum, which, 
I suppose, we have a right to call upon for Information. It might be different as to 
the Smithsonian Institution, hut as the resolul ion relates to the Museum, I presume 
we have that authority. There is no reason why we should not have it. 

Mr. Hoar. We have authority to give such directions to the heads of I lepartments, 
which rests on unbroken usage from the beginning of the Government, but I am not 
aware that one House of Congress has a rigid to order an executive officer of the Gov- 
ernment to do anything for its con vet deuce, especially that we have such control over 
the Regents <>r the Smithsonian Institution. It may be there is such authority re- 
served by statute. I shall not interpose an objection to the resolution, because I know 
personally the officers referred to would be anxious to communicate the information, 

and it is the desire of 1 he Senator from low i. 

The President pro tempon M there be no objection to the present consideration 
of the resolution, the question is on agrei ing to the same 
The resolution was agreed to 



30 report of national museum, 1889. 

Smithsonian Institution, 

March 2, 1889. 

Sir: In response to the Seuate resolution asking for " a schedule of 
the classified service of the officers aud employes of the National Mu- 
seum," I have the honor to transmit the accompanying schedule, which 
represents the present actual necessities of the service. 

The service for the fiscal year of 1SS7-'S8 was reported upon in a let- 
ter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, dated December 1, 
1888 (H. E. Mis. Doc. No. 55, Fiftieth Congress, second session). 

In this the aggregate expenditures for service were shown to have 
been $122,750.47, of which sum $07,493.32 was paid from the appro- 
priation for preservation of collections. $10,203.70 from that for furni- 
ture and fixtures, and $G,053.3C fiom that for heating, lighting, aud 
electrical aud telephonic service. 

A schedule of the number of persons employed in the various depart- 
ments of the Museum was also given in this letter (pages 4, 0, 11). 
This schedule should, however, be regarded only as an approximate 
one, since many of the employes were actually engaged only a part of 
the year, and others were temporarily transferred to the pay-rolls of 
the Cincinnati Exhibition and were engaged in special work in connec- 
tion with that exhibition. 

It is estimated that the aggregate expenditures for services for the 
present fiscal year (1888-'89) will be $129,710, of which amount $103,000 
will be paid from the appropriation for preservation of collections, 
$20,000 from that for furniture and fixtures, and $5,710 from that for 
heating, lighting, and electrical and telephone service. 

In the schedule herewith transmitted it is shown that for the proper 
working of the Museum the amount required for services would be as 
follows: 

For salaries of scientific assistants $56, 300. 00 

For clerical forces 36, 920. 00 

For services in preparing, mounting, and installing the collections 22, 060. 00 

For services in policing, caring for, and cleaning the buildings 36,740.00 

For services in repairing buildings, cases, and objects in the collections.. 14, 163. 50 
For salaries and wages in designing, making, and inspecting cases and 

other appliances for the exhibition and safe-keeping of the collections. 18,337.50 
For services in connection with the heating, lighting, and electrical and 

telephonic service 6, 620.00 

For services of miscellaneous employes, including draughtsmen, messen- 
gers, etc ". 7,980.00 

Total 199,121.00 

The increase in the total expenditure, as indicated, is due partly to 
the addition of a number of officers to the scientific staff, and also to 
the necessity for a few additional clerks, and a considerable number of 
watchmen, laborers, cleaners, and messengers, whose services are essen- 
tial to the safety of the collections, as well as to provide for the clean- 
liness and proper care of the buildings and for the comfort of visitors. 

The rates of pay indicated are in most cases considerably lower than 
are customarily allowed for a similar service in the Executive Depart- 
ments. 

In the schedule now presented, expenditure for services only is taken 
into consideration. 

No attempt has been made to present the needs of the Museum in 
regard to the purchase or collecting of specimens, the purchase of gen- 
eral supplies, preservatives, materials for mounting aud installing col- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31 

lections, books, exhibition eases, furniture, fuel and gas, the main- 
tenance of the heating and lighting appliances, freight and cartage, 
traveling expenses of collectors and agents, etc. 

Tor these various purposes the expenditure in the last fiscal year 
amounted to $45,249.53, and that for the present fiscal year will, it is 
estimated, amount to about $48,000, a sum very inadequate to the needs 
of the service. 

It does not include the expenditures lor printing the labels and blanks, 
and proceedings and bulletins of the Museum, for which the appropri- 
ation for many years past has been $10,000, and for which I have asked 
$15,000 for the coming fiscal vear. 

I must not omit to call your attention to the fact that owing to the 
peculiar constitution of the Museum as a scientific establishment, it has 
hitherto been possible to secure a special economy, owing to the fact 
that its officers and employes are not scheduled as in the Executive De- 
partments. 

In thus presenting, in obedience to the request of the Senate, a 
schedule of a durable organization of the service, 1 wish to remark, 
emphatically, that there are pressing needs in other directions — needs 
that merit the serious consideration of Congress, in order that the 
National Museum may be enabled to maintain a satisfactory position in 
comparison with those of European nations. 

I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant, 

S. P. Langley, 

Secretary. 

Hon. John J. Ingalls, 

President pro tempore of the Senate.

The rapid growth of the Museum renders a more definite classification 
of its employe's and in some instances larger salaries desirable, and it is 
hoped that this schedule, or one similar in its general features, will be 
ultimately accepted by Congress. There are, however, so many other 

considerations for which money is i led, as for instance the purchase 

of specimens, that it seems doubtful whether it is wise to bring this 
matter yet to a final issue.

34 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



E._ REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENTS. 

Department of Ethnology. — Prof. O. T. Mason, Curator, mentions in 
his report nine collections, received during the year, as being of more 
than usual value. He has paid much attention during the year to the 
formation of several special exhibits, by which it is intended to bring 
before the eye of the visitor at a glance the entire collection from a defi- 
nite locality, or to explain, within as limited a range as possible, a 
given art or industry of a particular tribe of Indians. This plan is in 
continuation of the method of installation of the Eskimo collection by 
Lieut. T. Dix Bolles in 188G. The subjects of fire making, heating, and 
lighting have been carefully studied by Mr. Walter Hough. 

Special attention has also been paid to the study of transportation on 
the backs of men and women, to aboriginal hide dressing, to aboriginal 
cradles, and to the evolution of common tools, the knife, the hammer, 
the saw, etc. To interest the boys who visit the Museum a series of 
"jack-knives" has been arranged for public inspection, and the interest 
which such a case excites is shown by the gifts made constantly to the 
series. 

In the latter part of the year the Curator commenced to collect for 
public reference a card catalogue of the resources of anthropology, to 
serve as a reference to the resources of the science, so that a special 
student, a lecturer, or a college professor can be put at once into com- 
munication with the chief sources of information. 

Several exchanges of specimens have been effected during the year 
with other museums, notably the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, The 
Cincinnati Art Museum, and with Dr. Gosse, of Geneva, Switzerland, 
with the Royal Ethnological Museum in Berlin, and with Mr. Edward 
Lovett, of Croydon, England. The accessions of the year in this depart- 
ment were from sixty localities, and eight hundred and sixty specimens 
were received. The catalogue entries during the year were seven hun- 
dred and twenty-one in number. 

Section of Oriental Antiquities. — Dr. Cyrus Adler, Assistant Curator, 
has devised an excellent plan for making copies of the smaller Assyro- 
] la In Ionian objects preserved in this country. These consist, for the 
most part, of seals, and are of much importance in the study of the his- 
tory of Assyro-Babylonian religion and art. The primary object of the 
establishment of this section in the Museum was to collect copies of 
these seals and specimens of similar import. The history, archaeology, 
languages, arts and religions of the peoples of Western Asia and Egypt 
are included in the scope of the section. 

In common with several other departments in the Museum, this sec- 
tion was called upon to prepare an exhibit for the Cincinnati Exhibi- 
tion. This work occupied several weeks, and a report upon the exhibit 
has been prepared by Dr. Adler and will be published in a future re- 



BEPQBT OF ASSISTANT SECRETAUY. 35 

port. Prof. Paul llanpt. Honorary Curator, has .secured from the 
Royal Museum of Berlin aud tlie British Museum several valuable 
casts of Assyrian and Egyptian objects. Labels have been prepared 
for the Assyro- Babylonian seals, aud also for the Assyrian photographs 
from the British Museum, the Bouhls photographs, and the Assyrian 
aud Egyptian objects from the Royal Museum of Berlin. Dr. C. John- 
son, jr., of the Johns Hopkins University, has made an examination of 
an interesting Persian astrolabe, and has presented a paper entitled 
" The Chaldean Astronomy." 

It may not be improper in this connection, to call attention to the 
proposed edition of the "Life and Writings of Edward Hincks," by the 
Semitic Seminary of the Johns Hopkins University. In July the Smith- 
sonian Institution consented to make the Institution a depository for 
papers aud manuscripts sent to this country to further the prosecution 
of the work. Prof. F. Max Miiller, of the University of Oxford, under 
date of September 27, forwarded manuscript letters of Dr. Hincks in 
Ins possession; and under date of October 20 he kindly offered to per- 
manently deposit these letters in the Smithsonian Institution. 

Section of Transportation and Engineering. — Work in this section has 
been seriously interrupted by the necessar5" absence of the Curator, 
Mr. J. E. Watkins, at the Cincinnati Exposition, where a collection of 
objects was exhibited illustrating the development of the various 
systems of transportation. The exhibit was arranged in seven series, 
and is fully described in a special paper prepared by Mr. Watkins for 
publication in a future report. 

- Among the important accessions during the year may be specially 
noticed the following objects: A Japanese kago (or palanquin), ob- 
tained through Mr. Hieromich Shugio, made of wood, beautifully lac- 
quered and elaborately ornamented ; and a model of a Japanese jin- 
rikisha. Several interesting relics have been received, as, for instance, 
the bell of the locomotive " Bah way," cast in 1838, and a section of the 
first heavy iron rail rolled in America, presented to the Museum by the 
Baltimore ami Ohio Railway Company. A number of valuable draw- 
ings, illustrating the development of marine steam engineering, have 
been added to the collection. 

A rearrangement of the exhibition series has been commenced, and 
is described in detail in the report of, the Curator. 

Section of Graphic Arts. — Mr. S. R. Koehler, Curator, states in his re- 
port that his special aim is "to represent art as an industry." This may 
perhaps be more intelligibly rendered by the statement that art pro- 
ductions of all kinds, considered primarily from their technical side, are 
included in the scope of this section. The Section of Graphic Arts was 
organized in January, 1887, and, no report having yet been submitted 
by the Curator, the one now published in Section n of this report relates 
to the work accomplished since that date. The contributors of material 
to this collection number one hundred and six, some of whom had been 



36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

iuvited to assist the Curator in the preparation of a special exhibit for 
the Cincinnati Exposition. The catalogue of this sectiou now contains 
2,894 entries, of which 294 represent objects which were purchased for 
the collection, chiefly old prints, and such other material as could not 
be obtained by gift. On March 31, 1888, there had beeu made 936 
entries in the catalogue. At this time the first arrangement of the 
collection in the Museum had just been completed. 

The thanks of the National Museum are due esecially to Mr. Peter 
Moran, Messrs. L. Prang & Co., the Photo-Engraving Company, W. H. 
Whitcomb & Co., Mr. John Durand, and Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney for 
their generous co-operation and contributions. 

Mr. Koehler has prepared a catalogue of the collection prepared for 
exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposition. A full list of the names of all 
who have contributed to the collection since this section was organized 
may be found in the report of the Curator.* 

Department of Prehistoric Anthropology. — The number of specimens 
added to the collection during the year has been 6,972, making a total 
number of 116,472 specimens in the collection. Mr. Thomas Wilson, 
Curator, states in his report that a great deal of his time has been con- 
sumed in examining and reporting upon objects sent for determination. 
The work of classifying and placing upon exhibition the specimens 
which were assigned to the exhibition series, has been rapidly pushed 
forward. A re-arrangement of the anthropological collection, which is 
still exhibited in the large hall on the second floor of the Smithsonian 
building, has been commenced, and Mr. Wilson's plan of re-arrangement 
is given in detail in his report.* 

Fourteen of the collections received during the year have been con- 
sidered by Mr. Wilson sufficiently valuable to receive special notice. 
The contributions of the U. S. Fish Commission from Patagonia, Straits 
of Magellan, Lower California, and California, have been numerous and 
of great importance. These collections were made by the steamer Al- 
baross during the voyage from Virginia to California in 18S7-1S88. 

Mr. Wilson has continued his researches in regard to the existence 
of paleolithic implements in the United States. There have been 14,000 
entries made iu the catalogue of the department. A special exhibit, 
intended to indicate the existence and geographic distribution of pre- 
historic man, as shown by the implements and objects which he manu- 
factured and used, was prepared by the Curator for the Cincinnati 
Exposition. This exhibit is described by Mr. Wilson in a paper which 
will be published in a future report. 

Section of Aboriginal Pottery. — Among the more important additions to 
this section may be mentioned a collection of pottery from a mound near 
Lake Apopka, Florida, made by Dr. Featherstonehaugh, and a collection 
from a mound near Perdido Bay, Alabama, made by Mr. F. H. Parsons. 



See Section n. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37 

Mr. William H.Holmes, Honorarj Curator, regards tin- latter col- 
lection as one of the most important yet received from the Gulf coast. 

.Mr. Holmes has found time to make a study of the pottery of tin- 
Potomac tide-water region during the year, and lias prepared a paper 
upon this subject, which will appear in the "American Anthropologist." 

Tbe number of specimens added to the collection during the year is 
1,100, necessitating 634 entries in the catalogue. 

The Forestry Collection. — This section was established in April, 1889. 
Dr. B. E. Fernow, chief of the Forestry Division in the Department of 
Agriculture, has been appointed Honorary Curator. It has not been 
possible to accomplish very much during the three months of the 
existence of this section before the close of the fiscal year, but Dr. Fer- 
now has submitted a report,* in which he gives a brief outline of the 
scope of the collection which he hopes to make, aud of the manner in 
which it may best be classified. A series of pictures illustrating the 
work of the French Forest Administration, and other objects, have 
already been placed on exhibition on a panel 14 by 12 feet. The Secre- 
tary of Agriculture has expressed his interest iu the formation of this 
collection, and the Smithsonian Institution is greatly indebted to him 
for his co-operation in this branch of the Museum work. 

Department of Mammals. — Special attention has been given in this 
department to providing better storage facilities for the study series 
of specimens, which has been largely increased by the collection of 
North American mammals deposited in the Museum by the Division 
of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy in the Department of Agri- 
culture. Groups of prairie-dogs and opossums have been mounted for 
exhibition and placed in new cases of special design. 

The following contributors are mentioned in Mr. True's report as 
having presented material of especial value to the collection: Mr. 
William Wittfield, who presented two specimens of the Florida musk 
rat, Neofiber alleni; Mr. Loren W. Green, from whom was received a 
series of skins of the northern variety of Tamias striatus; Dr. R. W. 
Shufjjldt, who presented a. specimen of Hesperomys truei ; Mr. -lames (i. 
Swan, from whom was received a specimen of Vespertilio longicrus. 
Dr. Arthur Edwin Brown, of the Zoological Society of Philadelphia, 
contributed a small deer, probably of the species Cariacus gymnotus. 
The skin of a full-grown moose was obtained by Col. Cecil Clay for the 
Museum. Several exotic mammals were also secured by gift and pur- 
chase. Capt. J. L. Gaskell, keeper of the life-saving station at 
Atlantic City, forwarded to the Museum a specimen of Sowerby's 
whale, Mesoplodon bidens. Mr. True states in his report that this is the 
second specimen ever taken in American waters, and is the first fresh 
specimen ever seen by American naturalists. A few South American 
mammals were obtained by the naturalists of the 0". S. Pish Commis- 
sion steamer Albatross. The most important were the skeleton of a

porpoise^ Prodrlphinus longirvstris, obtained between Panama and the 
Galapagos Islands, and several skins of the sea-lions inhabiting those 
islands. During the year there were added to the collection of skins 
192 specimens, and to the alcoholic series 35 specimens. The catalogue 
of the department has been increased by 033 entries. 

A series representing all the existing families of mammals was pre- 
pared for exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposition, and a descriptive 
guide to the collection has been prepared for publication. 

Department of Birds. — Mr. Eobert Eidgway, Curator of this depart- 
ment, states in his report that the re-arrangement, labeling, and gen- 
eral improvement of the exhibition series has been actively contin- 
ued. Nine special exhibits of birds and eggs have been completed. A 
considerable portion of the time of the Curator has been devoted to 
committee work in connection with the revision of the check-list of the 
American Ornithologist's Union. Special investigations have also been 
made by the Curator, on the genera Psittacula, Accipiter^Xiphocolaptes, 
and Sclerurus. A large collection from Costa Eica has been studied, 
and also the extensive collection made by the naturalists of the Fish 
Commission steamer Albatross in Alaska and in various portions of 
South America. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger has continued his work on 
Jajianese ornithology. 

Dr. J. A. Allen, of New York City, Dr. P. L. Sclater and Mr. Osbert 
Salviu, of London, England, Count von Berlepsch, of Miinden, Ger- 
many, and several other active workers, have received material from the 
Museum to aid them in their studies of particular groups of American 
birds. 

In March Dr. Stejneger severed his relations with this department, 
having been appointed Curator of the Department of Eeptiles and Ba- 
trachians. 

The accessions of the year number 1,490 specimens, of which 990 have 
been placed in the reserve series, 147 assigned to the duplicate series, 
while 347 specimens have been added to the exhibition collection. 
There are now 0,714 specimens on exhibition. Mr. Eidgway has made 
special mention in his report of 47 of the more important accessions 
received during the year. 

Section of Birds'' Eggs.— Ca>j)t. Charles E. Bendire, U. S. A., Hon. 
Curator, has continued the classification and arrangement of the new 
material, and has made considerable progress in re-labeling the reserve 
series of eggs in accordance with the revised check-list of the American 
Ornithologist's Union. He has also arranged a series of foreign eggs, of 
which there are now 4,913 specimens. Six collections of more than usual 
value have been received during the year. There are now more than 
50,000 specimens in the collection. In the catalogue book 118 entries 
have been made. 

Department of Reptiles and Batrachians. — Dr. H. C. Yarrow, U. S. 
A., who for several years has been in charge of this department, 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. .'J!) 

having resigned, Dr. Leohhard Stejneger was in March appointed Cura- 
tor of the department. He lias commenced making a complete 1 exami- 
nation of the entire eolleetion, an<l reports that at the close of the fiscal 
year he was still at work on the reserve series of North American spe- 
cies. The cataloguing of the new material and of specimens previously 
received but not catalogued, has been continued. The most important 
accession during the year was the collection made by the naturalists of 
the U. S. Fish Commission Steamer Albatross. It contains three hun- 
dred and nineteen specimens, which have been sent to Prof. E. 1). Cope, 
of Philadelphia, for special report. Four other accessions are mentioned 
in the Curator's report as of especial interest. 

The types of eight species have been Identified and re-labeled. Dur- 
ing the year Professor Cope has finished his work on the North 
American Batrachians, published as Bulletin 34 of the C. S. National 
Museum, and has commenced a study of North American snakes. Dr. 
G. Baur, of Yale College, has had for study a number of Ch'elbriiatis, 
and some of the results of his studies are referred to in the bibliog- 
raphy.* 

Dr. Stejneger reports that the condition of the collection is good, hut 
that the re-numbering and re-labeling of specimens is constantly found 
to be necessary. During the year 741 specimens have been added to 
the collection, and 784 entries made in the catalogue. The excess of 
the latter over the former is accounted for by the fact that some of the 
material received before this fiscal year had not been catalogued. 

The Curator has been unable to devote much time to scientific study 
of the collection during the few months he has been in charge. What 
little he has been able to do has been in connection with an invest i<>a- 
tion of the status of the boiform snakes of North America, with special 
reference to individual variation. 

Department of Fishes. — It has been necessary for Dr. Tarleton H. 
Bean, Honorary Curator of this department, to spend the greater part 
of the year on special work pertaining to the Fish Commission. Dr. 
r.can has recently taken charge of the editorial work of the Fish Com- 
mission, leaving very little time to be devoted to Museum matters. 1 hir- 
ing his absence from the city Mr. Barton A. Bean; his assistant, was 
left in charge of the department. The entire collection of fishes has 
been overhauled and the jars supplied with fresh alcohol. In addition 
to the large and valuable collections received from the II. S. Fish Com- 
mission, several other important collections have been added to the <•<>! 
lection. Ten of these are especially referred to in the report of the Cu- 
rator. 

During the last six months of the year Dr. Bean prepared mid had 
published in various journals numerous papers upon the Stilmonidcc and 
other species of lishes. A list of these papers is given in the Bibliog 

raphy.*

40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The number of specimens received during the year was about 6,000, 
and 1,476 catalogue entries have been made. There are now, according 
to Dr. Bean's report, about 30,000 specimens in the exhibition series, 
60,000 specimens in the reserve series, and 25,000 duplicates. The Cu- 
rator calls attention in his report to the inadequacy of the case and 
storage room provided for the collection, and states that it has on this 
account become necessary to arrange the jars containing recent addi- 
tions upon the floor. 

Department of Molluslts. — The labeling, determiuiug, and registration 
of old and new material has occupied a large share of the time of Mr. 
William H. Dall, Honorary Curator, and his assistants. Seven cases, 
containing a part of the Lea collection of Unionidee, have been arranged 
for exhibition. Much progress has been made in cleaning and assort- 
ing the fossils. Considerable time has been devoted to the arrange- 
ment of the collection representing the fauna of the southeastern shores 
of the United States and adjacent waters. A check-list of this fauna 
is now being printed. The collection contains about fifteen thousand 
specimens. Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, Adjunct Curator, has devoted a por- 
tion of his time to the land and fresh water shells, especially of North 
America. He has also pushed forward the revision and labeling of old 
material. The Curator has supplied information of various kinds to 
forty-three correspondents, necessitating a large amount of labor and 
correspondence. 

Mr. Dall has found time to finish his investigation of the Mollusca 
obtained by the United States steamer Blake under the supervision of 
Professor Agassiz in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and 
has continued work on the dredgings obtained by the U. S. Fish Com- 
mission in the same region, and also upon the collections obtained 
last year by the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross during its 
voyage to California. He has also been occupied in a new systematic 
arrangement of the bivalve shells, and has studied the correlation of 
the tertiary fossils of the southeastern Atlantic coast with the recent 
fauna. Dr. Stearns has prepared for publication a paper on prehistoric 
shell money. 

Next in importance to the accessions received from the Fish Commis- 
sion during the year is a collection consisting of about five thousand 
specimens of shells from all parts of the world. This was presented by 
Messrs. F. B. and J. D. McGuire on behalf of the heirs of the late J. C. 
McGuire, of Washington. A collection containing about three hundred 
species was received from the Auckland Museum, New Zealand. Inter- 
esting series of specimens have been received from Messrs. E. W. 
Webster and J. J. White. Small though valuable collections have 
been presented by Mr. Henry Hemphill and Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. 
Navy. Large collections of fossil shells have been received from the 
U. S. Geological Survey, and of almost equal importance is the collec- 
tion from the fossiliferous deposits of Florida, presented by Mr. Joseph 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 41 

Willcox. The entries in the catalogues of this department daring the 

year are 0,323 in number. About 13,000 specimens have been received, 
giving a total of 408,000 specimens in the entire collection. 

Department of Insects. — More time than in any previous year has been 
devoted by Dr. G. V. Eiley, Honorary Curator of this department, to the 
preparation of collections for exhibition. A special series, designed 
rather for educational use than for museum purposes, was prepared for 
the Cincinnati Exposition. The installation of a permanent exhibition 
scries has been commenced in the southeast range. In April Mr. J. B. 
Smith, Assistant Curator, resigned his position to accept a chair in 
Rutgers College, New Brunswick. During the Curator's absence, from 
April to the close of the fiscal year, Mr. L. O. Howard, of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, took charge of the department, and the thanks 
of the Museum are due to him for his energetic administration of its 
affairs. Mr. Martin Linell has been appointed aid. 

The work of naming specimens for collectors, the arrangement and 
selection of material to be sent to specialists for determination, the ar- 
rangement in permanent shape of the reserve series, and the preserva- 
tion of the general collection, have received as much attention as op- 
portunity would allow. 

Several researches of a special character upon Museum material have 
been made during the year. These are nine in number, and are re- 
ferred to in the report of the Curator.* 

Twenty collections of more than ordinary interest have been received. 
About 8,000 specimens have been added to the collections during the 
year, and 78 catalogue entries have been made. The entire collection 
now contains, as estimated, G03,000 specimens. 

Department of Marine Invertebrates. — Mr. Richard Rathbun, Honorary 
Curator, has been unable to devote much of his time during the year to 
the work of this department, owing to the pressing duties which have 
been placed upon him in connection with the work of the U. S. Fish 
Commission. The exhibition hall of this department, in the west end 
of the Smithsonian building, has been repaired and repainted, and is 
now open to visitors. The principal accessions have, as usual, been 
obtained from the Fish Commission, although these have been far less 
numerous than in any previous year, since the Fish Commission has 
lately retained its collections of marine animals with a view to their 
being studied and reported upon before being transferred to the Mu- 
seum. For this reason probably not more than three hundred speci- 
mens have been added to the collection during the year. Interesting 
collections have been received from Lieut. J. F. Moser, U.S. Navy; 
Mr. Henry Hemphill; Dr. Louis F. EL Birt, of the Nicaragua Canal 
Construction Company; .Mr. Romyn Hitchcock, who presented a small 
collection of crustaceans and sponges from Japan, and from Mr. .lames 
C Swan, of Port Townsend, Washington.

42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

A collection of marine specimens was prepared and transmitted to the 
Cincinnati Exposition. It consisted mainly of large specimens, and also 
contained examples of fish food and many microscopical preparations. 
Upon its return from Cincinnati the more interesting portions of the 
exhibit were placed in the exhibition hall. 

Mr. Rathbun has found it impracticable to devote very much time to 
original research, but has given a limited amount of study to the Madre- 
porarian corals, and particularly to those collected by the steamer Al- 
batross in the Gulf of Mexico and on the voyage from Norfolk to San 
Francisco. 

Prof. A. E. Verrill and Prof. S. I. Smith have continued their work 
upon the invertebrate collections of the Fish Commission. Prof. Edwin 
Linton is making a special study of internal parasites of fishes. Ar- 
rangements have been made with Prof. Walter Faxon to prepare a report 
upon the crayfishes added to the department since 1885, and Mr. J. 
Walter Fewkes has completed a paper on certain of the Medusae ob- 
tained by the Fish Commission steamer Albatross in the region of the 
Gulf Stream. Several of the groups of marine invertebrates obtained 
by the Albatross during its voyage around South America have been 
assigned to specialists outside of Washington for study and report. 

Nineteen sets of marine invertebrates have been distributed to schools 
and colleges during the year. Each set contained about one hundred 
and ten species, the greater part of which are preserved in alcohol. 

Mr. Rathbun in his report briefly reviews the marine explorations of 
the steamers Albatross and Fish Haiclc and of the schooner Grampus. 

The number of catalogue entries has been 3,214. 

Department of Comparative Anatomy. — Mr. F. W. True, Acting Curator 
of this department, reports that his activities have been principally 
directed towards reducing the accumulations of osteological material. 
A large number of skulls and skeletons have been cleaned and made 
available for use. The skulls of about five hundred specimens of small 
animals, deposited by the Department of Agriculture, have also been 
prepared. Mr. F. A. Lucas, Assistant Curator, has been occupied in 
the arrangement of the collection of vertebrate fossils, and in mount- 
ing a cast of the skeleton of Dinoceras, received from the Tale College 
Museum. Mr. Lucas also had charge of the preparation for shipment 
of the collection of mammals for exhibition at the Cincinnati Expo- 
sition. 

The preparation of a card catalogue of alcoholic birds has been com- 
menced, and is well advanced, and a large amount of work has been 
done in classifying and caring for this valuable portion of the collec- 
tion. 

Some work has been done in the preparation of specimens of soft 
anatomy and of the invertebrate material. The preparation and ar- 
rangement of the vertebrate fossils have also received some attention. 

The principal accessions during the year were of mammals and birds. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 43 

No attempt has yet been made to aequire invertebrate specimens for 
this department. The most important addition to the exhibition scries 
of skeletons was an Atlantic Right whale, Balc&m Msdwyensis. This 
was purchased from Prof II. A. Ward, of Rochester, N. Y. A skele- 
ton of Sowerby's whale. Meseplodoli hi/lens, was prepared from the speci- 
men obtained from Gapt.-J: L. Gaskell, keeper of the life saving station 
at Atlantic City. The U. S. Fish Commission furnished skins of dol- 
phins, a skeleton of the Fork-tailed gull, Oremgits fwcaitw, and a collec- 
tion of birds and Elephant tortoises from the Galapagos Islands and the 
Straits of Magellan. An alcoholic collection of typical New Zealand 
birds was obtained from the Auckland Museum, and a similar collec- 
tion of Australian birds was obtained from the Australian Museum at 
Sydney. In all 195 specimens have been added to the collection dur- 
ing the year v The number of catalogue eutries during the same period 
has been 1,054. The excess of this number over the total number of 
specimens received is accounted for by the large amount of work ac- 
complished upon accumulations of osteological material from past years. 

Department of Paleozoic Fossils. — By far the larger portion of the 
accessions to this department has been obtained through the II. S. 
Geological Survey. Mr. C. D. Walcott, Honorary Curator, has con- 
tributed to the Museum collections, through his official connection 
with the Geological Survey, a large series of Lower Middle Cambrian 
fossils from Newfoundland. lie reports that the Lower Cambrian 
geueraand species have been worked over and named, and that a large 
quantity of new material has been added to the collection. From 
Newfoundland alone not less than 3,000 specimens have been transferred 
to the Museum during the year. Mr. Walcott in his report makes 
special mention of nine accessions. The material in the collection has 
been increased during the year by the addition of 0,177 specimens. The 
number of catalogue eutries during the same period was 583. 

Department of Mesozoic Fossils. — The official duties of Dr. C. A. White, 
Honorary Curator, in connection with the Geological Survey, has pre- 
vented him from devoting more than a small Share of time to work upon 
the Museum collection* A great deal has, however, been accomplished, 
and the collection of Mesozoic Fossils is now in far better condition than 
it has ever been before. Numerous type specimens of species which 
have been published in various Government reports, have, been installed 
and are now on exhibition in the south east court. The principal acces- 
sions during the year ha ve$ as usual, been obtained through the l.S. 
Geological Survey, Jn addition, type specimens of twelve species of 
cretaceous fossils were transmitted to the Museum by President 1). S. 
Jordan, of Indiana State University. Prom the Fish Commission has 
been received an interesting collection of cretaceous fossils from the 
Straits of Magellan. Altogether, 31 1 specimens have be»n added to the 
collection during the year, and 117 entries have been made in the cata- 
logue. 



44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Department of Botany. — Dr George Vasey, of the Department of* Ag- 
riculture, has beeu appointed Honorary Curator of this department, and 
in that capacity has control of the collections both in the Department 
of Agriculture and in the National Museum. A brief statement of the 
early history of these collections, and of the resulting conditions which 
led to this combination of the two collections, is given on pp. 19 and 
20. By this union of interests in the development of the National Her- 
barium, a great many good results will undoubtedly be effected. 

There are already in the Department of Agriculture arranged on 
shelves, in wall cases, occupying altogether a wall space of about 85 
running feet, not less than 120,000 sheets of botanical specimens. The 
general catalogue of the combined herbarium has not yet been made. 

The Department of Agriculture has employed for a part of the year 
three agents to collect botanical specimens and information respecting 
the vegetation of little known regions. One of these agents has oper- 
ated in western Texas, one in California (southern and lower), and one 
in Washington. From these agents we have received a large quantity 
of botanical specimens. 

Among the additions to the herbarium received during the year 
through the Smithsonian Institution, have been a collection of plants 
from South America and Alaska, made by officers of the U. S. Fish 
Commission steamer Albatross. Several packages containing plants 
and pertified wood were collected by Lieut. Pond in Lower California 
and the adjacent islands. A valuable collection of four hundred species 
of Japanese plants has been received from the Tokyo Educational Mu- 
seum. Five collections of duplicate specimens have been distributed 
to foreign herbaria. The number of specimens received during the 
year has been estimated at 459. 

Fossil plants. — Prof. Lester F. Ward, Honorary Curator, has been 
able to devote but little time to the work of the department, owing to 
the pressure of his duties as paleontologist of the Geological Survey, 
but as far as his time permitted he has been engaged in the study of the 
fossil plants of the Laramie group. He is preparing a monograph of the 
flora of this group, and hopes to complete it before very long. 

During the field season, between July and the latter part of October, 
Prof. F. H. Knowlton, Assistant Curator, visited the Yellowstone Park, 
where he made a collection of fossil plants and fossil woods which filled 
twenty-one boxes. After his return to Washington the boxes were 
opened, and the assortment of the collections was begun. Considera- 
ble time was spent in the study of this material, as well as upcn the 
material obtained during the previous season from the same region. 

Professor Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio, has completed the identifi- 
cation and elaboration of the large collection of fossil plants belonging 
to the National Museum, and collected by Capt. Charles E. Bendire in 
John Day Valley, Oregon. The material is very interesting, and con- 
tains many new species. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 45 

On account of the pressing nature of Professor Ward's duties in con- 
nection with the Geological Survey, lie lias not been able to prepare a 
report for this year, and this brief statement is therefore submitted in 
lieu of a formal report in Section n. 

Department of Minerals. — The growth of the collection during the 
year has, through the energetic administration of its Curator, Prof. F. 
W. Clarke, been very satisfactory. The two most important accessions 
were received from the U. S. Geological Survey. These collections 
were made by Prof. S. P. Penfield and by Dr. W. P. Hillebraud, who 
visited Colorado and the adjacent States and Territories for the purpose 
of making mineralogical investigations and collections. A series of 
specimens of wood opal, collected by Dr. A. C. Peale in Montana, has 
also been contributed by the Geological Survey. Professor Clarke in 
his report* makes mention of eleven accessions as of especial interest. 

It is to be deeply regretted that Mr. Joseph Willcox has found it 
necessary to withdraw his collection of minerals from the Museum, 
where it had been deposited for more than four years. Mr. Willcox 
had offered to sell this collection to the Museum for an exceedingly 
modest sum, but this offer could not be entertained, the Museum having 
no fund for the purchase of specimens, and thus the Museum has sus- 
tained an irreparable loss. 

A series of specimens, illustrating the gems and precious stones of 
North America, was prepared for exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposi- 
tion. 

During the year 5,794 specimens were added to the collection, and 
631 entries were made in the catalogue. 

Department of Lithology and Physical Geology. — There has been un- 
usual activity in the work of this department during the year. The 
Curator, Mr. George P. Merrill, has visited certain localities in North 
Carolina, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, and 
Maine, for the purpose of collecting specimens. These expeditions have 
resulted very advantageously to the Museum. Among the new mate- 
rial received sixteen collections have been selected as worthy of special 
mention in the report of the curator.* 

One of the objects of the expeditions already alluded to was for the 
purpose of collecting material for distribution to educational establish 
ments. It has been quite impossible to till the numerous applications for 
lithological specimens from museums, colleges, and schools throughout 
the country. Mr. Merrill has succeeded in obtaining a very large quan- 
tity available for this purpose, and during the coming winter it is ex- 
pected that a sufficient number of sets of specimens can be prepared to 
till the applications now on tile. Prom material on hand at the begin- 
ning of the year covered by this report, twenty-two sets of minerals 
were prepared and distributed. The determination of material sent for 
examination and report has occupied no inconsiderable portion of tii<-

Curator's time. During the year t\\ont\ five -lots" of material have 
been forwarded lor this purpose. 

The collection of building and ornamental stones now fills thirteen 
door-screen cases, one wall ease, two large pyramids, and the tops of 
three table eases. The eolleetions of roeks and rock-forming minerals 
are now as extensive as ean be taken eare of in the limited spaee at the 
eonunand of this department. These eolleetions now eomprise about 
two thousand specimens. The collections o( dynamic and historical 
geology have reeeived important additions during the year, but no at- 
tempt has yet been made to arrange them systematically. The total 
number of specimens received during the year has been 4,500, and 
L,135 entries have been made in the catalogue. 

l>< l>,irtmcnt of' Mctallurai/ and Economic (icoloi/i/. — The Curator, Mr. F. 
P. Dewey, has devoted his time ehieily to the preparation and arrange- 
ment oi the exhibition material, which is now installed in the south- 
west court. During the year the Curator made a visit to Providence, 
R. 1., tor the purpose of examining a collection of petroleum specimens 
and related materials which had been prepared by Prof. S. F. Peckham 
in connection with his work for the Tenth Census. This collection num- 
bers three hundred and sixty specimens, and illustrates very fully the 
occurrence of crude petroleum in this country. It is in the Museum, 
and will be placed upon exhibition as soon as practicable. Several 
valuable collections oi' ores have been added to the collection during 
the year, among which may be mentioned three series of foreign ores: 
one from the Australian Museum at Sidney, one from the Auckland 
Museum in Few Zealand, and one forwarded by the Hou. Otto E. Eei- 
mer. United States consul at Santiago de Cuba. 

1 hiring the year the Curator has made an examination of the produc- 
tion of pig-iron at the Muirkirk Furnace, near Washington, and nickel 
from Kussel Springs, Kansas. This was undertaken at the request of 
the Hon. J, J. Ingalls. 

The collection has been increased during the year by the addition of 
664 specimens, and 413 catalogue entries have been made. 

Department of Living Animals. — This department was organized in 
May. LSS8, and Mr. William T. Iloruada\ . who has recently been ap- 
pointed Superintendent of the National Zoological Park, retains charge 
of the collection. Owing to the limited space available for exhibiting 
these specimens, consisting of a wooden shed adjoining the Smithsonian 
building on the south, it has become necessary to decline several offers 
of valuable contributions to the collection. Mr. Hornaday has prepared, 
during the year, an exhaustive memoir relating to the discovery, life 
history, and extermination of the American Pison. Owing to the delay 
attending the printing o( the Museum report, it was found possible 
to include this paper in the report for 1887, proof of which is now being 
received from the Printing Office* In order to emphasize the rapid ex- 
termination of this and several other animals indigenous to the United 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17 

States, a large collection of objects illustrating this subject was pic- 
pared for the Cincinnati Exposition. Amongst the animals which have 
become extinct were shown the buffalo, the Californian sea-elephant, 
and the West Indian seal. In the series of species which are likely t<> 
disappear very soon were the mountain sheep, mountain goat, elk, ante 
lopes, moose, caribou, black-tail deer, beaver, otter, sea-otter, walrus, 
and grizzly bear. 

Among the most important accessions received during the year were 
three specimens of the American elk. presented by the lion. YV. F. 
Cody; a young Gray wolf, presented by Mr. C. A. Dole, of Glendiva, 
Montana; a collection of living tortoises from the Galapagos Islands, 
collected by the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross; and four 
Angora goats, received from Misses Grace and Maude Parsons. Of 
especial interest is a young Rocky Mountain sheep, Oris monlana, for- 
warded to the Museum by Mr. George Bird Griunell, editor of "Forest 
and Stream." 

Special cages have been constructed on the reservation south of the 
Smithsonian building for the grizzly bear, puma, and the eagles. A 
buffalo-yard has also been completed on the same reservation, and from 
it sections have been cut off to afford protection for the deer, mountain 
sheep, and other animals. 

In addition to Mr. Hornaday's other duties he has retained the super- 
vision of the taxidermic work of the Museum. There are now 491 speci- 
mens in the collection of living animals, represented by 341 entries on 
the catalogue of the department. 



F.— REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. 

PROGRESS OF OKNERAL AND INCIDENTAL WORK. 

Library. 

Mr. John Murdoch, librarian, has furnished the following state- 
ment of the operations of the library during the year: 

The total number of publications added to the library during the 
year is 6,052 (648 volumes of more than 100 pages, 903 pamphlets, 1,343 
parte of regular serials, and 158 charts). Of these. 441 volumes. C17 
pamphlets, and 3,752 parts of serials were retained for the use of the 
Museum from the accessions of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The remainder were obtained as usual by gift, exchange, and pur- 
chase. 

The most important accession to the library during the year was the 
gift of the heirs of the late Dr. Isaac Lea. of Philadelphia, consisting of 
137 volumes, 276 parts and 693 pamphlets, selected from his scientific 






48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

library, and comprising many works of the greatest value. Another 
important accession is a nearly complete series of the " Proceedings of 
the Zoological Society of London." This gift was received so late in 
the fiscal year that it has been impossible to enter and catalogue the 
books. When this can be done, most of them will be assigned to the 
sectional library of Mollusks. 

Apart from the regular exchanges, the following donations to the 
library are also worthy of notice : 

From Dr. Paul Haupt, Baltimore, 44 pamphlets on oriental subjects; 
from Prof. P. H. Carpenter, Eton College, England, 11) pamphlets, sci- 
entific papers by his distinguished father; from Mr. John Murdoch, 
Washington, 18 volumes, 2 pamphlets; from Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, 
Boston, 12 pamphlets. 

During the year 7,583 books were borrowed from the library. 

Ninety-four persons are now authorized under the regulations to 
draw from the Museum library, and of these seventy five are also au- 
thorized to obtain books irom the library of Congress through the Mu- 
seum library. During the year 245 orders were sent to the library of 
Congress. 

The method of keeping the records of loans and returns of books, re- 
ferred to in a previous report, has been used throughout the year with 
complete satisfaction. 

The card-catalogue by authors has been continued, and 1,442 titles 
have been added to it during the year. 

Through the kindness of the librarian of Congress, an order was ob- 
tained for binding 300 volumes of the books belonging to the Smith- 
sonian deposit in the Museum library. These books were therefore 
sent to the Government bindery on June 20, 1889. 

The work of covering and arranging the large collection of pamphlets 
has been continued, whenever the pressure of routine work would allow. 

No material change has been made in the force employed in the 
library since the last report. 

Sectional Libraries. 

The regular inspection of the sectional libraries by the librarian 
was begun May 22 and completed June 7. Since the last report, the 
name of the section of archaeology has been changed to Prehistoric 
Anthropology, and a new sectional library, that of Oriental Archaeol- 
ogy, in charge of Dr. Cyrus Adler, Assistant Curator of the Section of 
Oriental Antiquities, has been established. The Assistant Secretary 
has commenced the organization of his sectional library, that of Admin- 
istration. 

The following is the result of the inspection : 

Administration. — (In process of organization.) Inspected May 28, 
Contained 30 volumes and 1 pamphlet.

50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



TRANSPORTATION, STORAGE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES. 

The total number of boxes, packages, barrels, tanks, etc., received 
during the year is 16,625, of which 2,182 contained specimens for the 
Museum, the remainder being distributed to the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion and the other persons addressed. 

The registrar, Mr. IS. O. Brown, has continued to act as transportation 
clerk for the Smithsonian Institution, and this has entailed a consider- 
able addition to the routine work of his office. 

During the fiscal year 261 packages were entered upon the storage 
records, and 203 packages were removed from storage and turned over 
to the curators for study, and to aid in making up sets for distribution. 

Forty-eight boxes of duplicate and reserve material have been sent 
to general storage, and 57 specimens were sent out in exchange. 

Duriug the month of May the general storage room was removed 
from the "Old Armory" building to the storage shed west of the Armory 
building, and the storage separated into three sections. 

First. General storage, which is now confined to the large shed 
proper, and is used for the storage of Museum specimens only. 

Second. The south track of what is known as the "car shed " has been 
set aside for the accommodation of specimens collected by the U. S. 
Geological Survey and Bureau of Ethnology. All such specimens are 
entered in the Museum storage record, but are kept by themselves for 
convenience in haudling. 

Third. A new shed, 88 by IS feet, has been erected west of the old 
one. The south end of it, 10 by 18 feet, is reserved for the department 
of Lithology and Physical Geology, for the storage of its duplicate ma- 
terial; the remainder of the new shed (78 by 18 feet) has been assigned 
to the property division of the Museum, for the storage of cases, draw- 
ers, etc. 

The total number of packages sent out during the year is 2,552, of 
which 1,302 contained Museum material, transmitted as gifts or loans, 
or in exchange. 

The Museum has continued to lend photographs of exhibition cases 
to all who have made .formal application, and to send sample trays and 
boxes aud copies of labels to applicants. 

The distribution of specimens for the year, from the several depart- 
ments of the Museum, is shown in the appended table.

Duplicate sets* of marine objects have been sent out, as in the past, 
in response to applications received from museums and educational in- 
stitutions. 

The distribution for the year was as follows : 

Specimens. 

To domestic institutions 5, 5] 1 

To foreign institutions 5,871 

Total 11,382 

This number added to the total number of specimens sent out from 
1854toJune30, L888, which was 564,090, gives the grand total of 575,472 
specimens distributed by the Smithsonian Institution up to June 30, 
1 889. 

In addition to the regular sets of duplicates five special collections 

were also sent out. 

Thirty-four applications for duplicate specimens other than marine 
invertebrates have been received during the year and entered upon 
the register. A majority of these have been favorably acted upon. 

Mr. George P. Merrill has collected a large amount of material, 
which, together with duplicate specimens in the Museum, will be cut 
up and made into sets for distribution to educational establishments. 
Prof. F. \Y. Clarke has tor a similar purpose made large collections of 
minerals. 

Bight hundred specimens of minerals were sent out to over twenty 
establishments, and sixteen sets of duplicates were distributed to col- 
leges and schools. 

••Series iv. Each set in thi ontains 108 species. Six universities, five colli ools, 

ami mil' society have each reo ived ■> el during i In- year. A list of those is given in the report of the 
Curator of marine invertebrates. (Section n.)

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSETTM, 1889. 



(3) The Proceedings of the National Museum. — This series was 
begun in 1878 aud the twelfth annual volume — that tor 1889 — is now 
being printed.* 

Jn the first eleven volumes were printed seven hundred and sixty 
scientific papers in addition to thirty-four administrative papers printed 
from time to time in the appendix. 

The total of pages in the first ten volumes, excluding the appendices, 
is 6,112, 410 of plates, or 6,522 pages, constituting 406| signatures. 

Of Vol. xi there have been printed 671 pages of text with 60 plates. 
The total number of pages when the volume is complete will be about 
725 + 120 plate pages. 

In the table here introduced is shown the number of pages, text fig- 
ures and plates, in Vols. I to x of the " Proceedings."

This series was established for the purpose of securing prompt 
publication of discoveries in the Museum, and in order to secure this, 
the printing has been done signature by signature as fast as matter was 
prepared, aud a certain number of signatures have always been dis- 
tributed, as soon as published, to scientific institutions aud special- 
ists, these being dated by stamp in the Smithsonian Institution. The 
number of signatures of each volume thus distributed has been in the 
neighborhood of two hundred. 

This method of publication has seemed to be to some extent wasteful, 
and it is thought that good results may be secured by distributing a 
certain number of the advance copies in the form of authors' extras; 
consequently, in making the requisition for the printing of Vol. xii the 
following assignment was made: Out of an edition of 1,200 copies, 100 
to be delivered in signatures as fast as printed, and 300 in extras or re- 
prints, in paper covers, of which 50 are to be given to the authors and 
the remainder distributed to specialists, in the various departments to 

* Vol. xi and twelve papers of Vol. xn have been published between the end of the 
fiscal and the calendar year.

which the papers relate, who are not otherwise provided with the pub- 
lication. The 800 remaining volumes to be bound and distributed in 
this form. 

In special instances, where a given paper in the "Proceedings" is 
believed to be of great general interest and to require a larger distribu- 
tion, it has been customary to print from one hundred to one thousand 
extra copies. 

(4) The Museum Circulars: Of these, forty-one have now been 
printed. The first thirty three numbers of the cirulars were included 
as appendices to t lie Proceedings. Circulars 34 and 35 were printed in 
the report of the Museum. Circular 30 was issued only as a separate 
and what should be No, 37 was printed without a number in Vol. x of 
the "Proceedings" (page 701). It is believed that hereafter it will be 
more satisfactory to reprint them in the annual report of the Museum, 
since they are more of an administrative than of a scientific character. 
The object of printing them as appeudices to the " Proceedings" was to 
provide for the expense out of the fund for printing the "Proceedings," 
but since the printing fund is now more directly under the control of 
the Museum, it is quite practicable to priut such editions as may be 
needed of these administrative papers, and instead of having them 
electrotyped, they can be reset when the time comes for printing them 
in the report — a method which is rather less expensive to the Museum 
than the former one.

The publication of the Proceedings and the Bulletin was at first paid 
for from the printing fund of the Interior Department, with which the 
Museum was at that time in close relations in respect to financial mat- 
ters. Subsequently it was paid for from a fund for printing the labels 
of the Museum, estimates for which were annually submitted by the 
Secretary of the Interior at the request of the Secretary of the Institu- 
tion. The amount asked for was usually $10,000, but in I882-'83 the 
estimate was for $20,000, which sum, however, was not allowed. 
Although in the book of estimates, the Museum appears as asking a 



\ 

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61 

certain sum for printing, no reference was made in making the appro- 
priation for the Museum, but the money was given in the gross sum 
allotted to the Interior Department as a Printing Fund. 

In 1888, however, a separate appropriation was made for the lirst 
time in these words: "For the National Museum, for printing labels 
and blanks and for the Bulletins and Annual Volumes of the Proceed- 
ings of the Museum, $10,000." 

In 1880 the appropriation for the fiscal year 1800 was made in the 
same words, but was not included as heretofore in the appropriations 
for the Department of the Interior. 

The edition of the earlier volumes of the Proceedings and Bulletins 
was usually only 1,000, of which a portion was distributed by the De- 
partment of the Interior aud a portion by the Museum, the number 
received being sometimes as many as 500, and sometimes as few as U50.* 
The edition placed at the disposal of the Museum being so small and 
withal so uncertain as to number, the distribution was always of neces- 
sity informal, and no effort was made, except in the case of the signa- 
tures of Proceedings, already referred to, to provide for supplying 
copies to a regular list of institutions and specialists. A considerable 
number were used up in the work of the Museum, and the others were 
sent to correspondents of the Museum in exchange for publications, for 
specimens, and incidentally to such institutions as might apply for 
copies, as well as to individuals, especially students who made it evi- 
dent that they were in a position to make good use of the books. 

In some cases, as, for instance, that of the catalogues of the Animal 
Products and Fisheries Collection at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 
(Bulletin 14); the catalogue of the Exhibit of the Fisheries and Fish 
Culture of the United States of America at the International Fishery 
Exhibition at Berlin in 1880 (Bulletin 18), and the catalogue of the col- 
lection exhibited by the United States at the International Fisheries 
Exhibition at Loudon in 1883 (Bulletin 27), the entire edition, and 
indeed an extra large number of copies also, were entirely absorbed in 
special uses in connection with the exhibition work. I n other instances, 
such as Coues and Prentiss's "Catalogue of the Birds of the District of 
Colombia" (Bulletin 26) and Ward's -Guide to the Flora of Washing- 
ton and Vicinity" (Bulletin 22) the books were largely distributed to 
supply a local demand. 

It was, in fact, not intended that formal publication of these docu- 
ments should be made from the advance edition to which I have re- 
ferred. 

Formal publication was undertaken by the Smithsonian Institution, it 
being the intention that, the first cost of composition and electrotyping 
having been provided for by the special Congressional appropriation, 
the Smithsonian Institution should avail itself of the electrotype-plates

and use them in making up certain volumes of the Miscellaneous Col- 
lections. The papers published in the " Proceedings" and " Bulletin" 
of the Museum were of precisely the same character which since 1862 
had made up the great majority of the most important papers in the 
Miscellaneous Collections. The Institution then undertook to print 
an edition of 1,200 copies in the form of volumes of the Miscellaneous 
Collections, and to distribute them to the principal libraries of the 
world. This was at the time regarded as advantageous, since the cost of 
composition and electrotyping was always at least two-thirds of the cost 
of an edition of 1,200, and in addition to this the miscellaneous distribu- 
tion, for which the Institution in the case of similar publications printed 
at its own expense had been accustomed to provide, was now already 
provided for out of the j)reliuiinary issue of several hundred copies 
paid for from the Museum fund. 

The practice was in effect from 1878 to 1883, and five volumes of the 
Miscellaneous Collections were made up entirely of the " Proceedings" 
and "Bulletin" of the Museum, as is shown in the accompanying 
table.

Bulletin 1(5. 



In this manner the first four volumes of the "Proceedings" and the 
first sixteen numbers of the "Bulletin" were published, constituting in 
each instance about one-third of the entire series up to the present date. 

Since 1883 no publication of the " Bulletin" has been made, and none 
has been made in the case of the "Proceedings" since 1882. 

There remain unpublished, then, eleven volumes of the " Proceedings" 
and twenty-one numbers of the "Bulletin," in all sufficient to make 
ten thick volumes of the Miscellaneous Collections. Possibly, by con- 
densation and omissions the number might be reduced to nine volumes. 

If the Institution were to undertake to print the edition of 1,000, now 
customary in the case of the Miscellaneous Collections, the cost would 
be not less than $9,000. 

The same amount expended by the Institution in printing fresh mat- 
ter would probably not produce one and a half volumes, or at most 
two volumes, of Miscellaneous Collections. 

As a matter of fact, however, the publication of the edition of 1,000 
copies by the Smithsonian Institution would not really meet the neces- 
sities of the case, since it would leave unsupplied a very large number 
of libraries quite as deserving as those already on the list. 

In view of all these facts, it seems not desirable that the Institution 
should undertake hereafter the publication of the Museum "Bulletin" 
and "Proceedings," since it is evident that these will increase in bulk

from year to year, and that the demand upon the Institution would 
very soon become too burdensome. 

The desired result could be attained by obtaining from Congress an 
increase in the appropriation for the Museum printing. It would then 
be practicable to publish an edition of 2,000 copies in addition. A 
volume of Proceedings not exceeding 800 pages could then be printed 
each year, and an indefinite number of bulletins, not to exceed in the 
aggregate 1,(500 pages, with the necessary illustrations. 

It is estimated that an edition of at least 3,000 copies is needed in 
order to place these publications in the hands of those libraries which 
ought to receive them. 

Two tables are appended, one giving a list by States of the insti- 
tutions to which it would seem proper that distribution should first be 
made, and another, giving a schedule of the number required to supply 
not onlv the institutions in the United States, but also scientific socie- 
ties and specialists at home and abroad.

When the question of the publication of the back volumes is considered, 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 



65 



Vols, i to iv of the " Proceedings " and Bulletins 1 to 1G may be regarded 
as published ; although not to the extent to which it would seem desirable 
in the way of supplying local institutions. Of the following there are in 
hand enough to make a very fair distribution, viz : "Proceedings" Vol. 
x and XI, and " Bulletins" Nos. 33 to 37. Of Vols. V to ix of "Pro- 
ceedings" and of Bulletins 17 to 32, however, no systematic publication 
ran be made without the printing of an additional number of copies. 

There are, apparently, three ways in which the necessities of the case 
may be met. 

(1) For the* Smithsonian Institution to assume the publication in the 
Miscellaneous Collections of all the volumes of the Proceedings up to 
Vol. xn and of the Bulletins up to No. 40. Then to close the series and 
to begin the publication of two new series of " Proceedings ''and " Bul- 
letin " with a new 7 set of numbers, in each instance to begin with No. 1. 

(2) For the Smithsonian Institution to publish Vols. V to ix of the 
" Proceedings," and "Bulletins" 17 to 32, to make as judicious as pos- 
sible a distribution of the subsequent volumes, and to begin with the 
year 1890 the publication of two series, as already suggested. 

(3) To ask Congress in 1890 to appropriate a sum sufficient to complete 
the back sets of the " Proceedings" from Vol. I to xil, and in 1891 to 
make a similar request for the printing of back numbers of the " Bulle- 
tin ;"' in each case, if possible, securing an edition of 3,000 copies. 

Appended to this part of the report are three lists of institutions, and 
foreign and domestic libraries to which it is desired to send the future 
publications of the Museum. 

This is, of course, independent of the lists of special institutions and 
of specialists, who are provided with papers relatiug to their own pecul- 
iar lines of work, and also of institutions or individual specialists and 
correspondents of the Museum, with whom exchange is in progress, 
since such lists are constantly varying.

conditions of the jaws and nasal chambers." 

During- the year the following-named societies have, by permission, 
held meetings in the Museum lecture hall: 

The National Dental Association met on July 24, 25, and 2G. On the 
evening of September 20 was held one of the meetings of the Medical 
Congress. The American Ornithologists' Union held its sixth congress 
on November 13, 14, and 15. Meetings of the Department of Superin-

STUDENTS. 

Free access has as usual been given to students in the various branches 
of natural history. The Museum has also received valuable assistance 
from the volunteered co-operation of several specialists. In several in- 
stances special groups of objects have been studied and identified by 
naturalists, and iu this way both they and the Museum have received 
benefit. 

Ensign A. P. Niblack was assigned by the Secretary of the Navy to 
duty in the Smithsonian Institution on October 3, for the purpose of 
preparing a report on the Coast Indians of Alaska and Northern British 
Columbia. The report was made chiefly from notes taken by Ensign 
Niblack, iu connection with the survey of Alaska, 1885-1887. This re- 
port was completed in time to include it as one of the special papers in 
the Museum report for last year. 

Dr. C. Johnston, jr., of the Johns Hopkins University, has undertaken 
the study of a Persian Astrolabe, obtained by the Museum, and at the 
May meeting of the American Oriental Society presented a study, sug- 
gested by this instrument, entitled " The Chaldean Astronomy. " 

Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the Department of Agriculture, has made 
extensive studies of the arvicoliue mice in the collection of mammals, 
as well as of other groups of North American mammals. 

Prof. D. K. Shute, of the Medical Department of the Columbia Uni- 
versity, was afforded facilities for study in the laboratory of the De- 
partment of Comparative Anatomy, and free access to the study series 
of specimens. 

A portion of the collection of batrachians was lent to Prof. E. D. 
Cope to aid him iu completing the illustrations for his work on the Ba- 
trachiaof North America, since published as Bulletin 34 of the National 
Museum. 

Dr. John A. Ryder, of the University of Pennsylvania, has been en- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71 

gaged in a study of the vertebral column, and in this connection pieces 
of* the vertebral column of Chimaera were lent to him. Dr. Ryder has, 
in a letter dated April 11, 1889, stated that every step can now be 
traced of the process by which the axial column of vertebrata has be- 
come what it is in the highest types. 

.Messrs. Frank Burns and Charles B. Greene have, by permission of 
the Director of the I'. S. Geological Survey, rendered valuable assist- 
ance b\ their studies of the collections of Tertiary Mollusks. 

The collection of Materia Medica has been studied by several students 
of medicine in the District of Columbia. 

Dr. .1. A. Allen, of New York, Dr. P. L. Sclater, and Mr. Osbert 
Salvin, of London, Count von Berlepsch, of Miinden, Germany, and 
several other active ornithologists, have 1 received from the National 
Museum material to aid them in their studies of particular groups of 
American birds. 

Dr. G. Baur, of Yale College, New Haven, Connecticut, has had for 
study a number of the Chelonians belonging to the Museum. The re- 
sults of his studies have been published in Vol. xi of " Zoologischer 
Anzeiger," Vol. xxn of the "American Naturalist," Vol. in of "An- 
nals and Magazine of Natural History," Vol. ix of " Biologisehes Cen- 
tralMatt," and Vol. xi of " Proceedings of the U. S. National Museum." 

The undetermined Myriapoda in the collection of insects were sent 
to Mr. C. H. Bollmann,of Bloomington, Illinois, for study. The material 
in thf genera Oediomychis and J>isonycha were sent to Dr. George H- 
Horn, of Philadelphia, who is engaged in working up the genera of the 
RalticidcB. Capt. T. L. Casey, of New York City, is studying the 
Staphylinid group of beetles, and the Museum material in certain genera 
was sent to him for examination. 

Prof. A. I",. Verrill and Prof. S. I. Smith have continued their work 
upon the collections made by the (J. S. Fish Commission, and for the 
pies. -nt stored at the Peabody Museum of Yale College. Prof. Edwin 
Linton is studying the internal parasites of fishes collected chiefly by 
himself at Wood's Holl. Prof. Walter Faxon, of the Museum of Com- 
parative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, has promised to report 
upon the cray fishes received since L885, and Mr. J. Walter Fewkes has 
completed a paper on some of the Medusae collected by the Fish Com- 
mission steamer Albatross in t he region of the Gulf Stream. Prof. Les- 
lie A. Lee, chief naturalist of the Fish Commission steamer Albatross, 
has assorted the collections made by that vessel during the voyage 
around South America, and several groups of marine objects have been 
sent, for study and report, to different naturalists. These are referred to 
at greater length in the report* of Mr. Richard Bathbun, curator of the 
Department of Marine [n vertebrates. Dr. T. II. Bean, curator of 
Fishes, has rendered assistance to several students of ichthyology in 
this and other cities.

The average amount paid on the monthly roll for this year is $9,054.22 ; 
the smallest number of employes in any mouth is 130 for November, 
1888 ; the largest, 167, in March, 1889, when extra service was required 
on account of the crowds of strangers visiting the Museum ; the aver-

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73 

The average amount paid this year on the monthly roll for furniture 
and fixtures is $1,472.02, The greatest number of employes in anyone 
month is 33; the smallest, 20 ; the average, 27. The highest salary is 
$150, paid to the Engineer of Property ; the lowest pay on this roll, to 
a cleaner of glass, is $30 ; the average being $54.18. 

STANDARD CASES AND OTHER MUSEUM FURNITURE. 

Among the various items of standard museum furniture there are 
none, perhaps, that fill the purpose for which they were designed more 
satisfactorily than the unit-tables, storage cases and drawers for the 
storage of specimens. 

The standard round columns, which support forty-eight wing-frames, 
are of great utility where space is limited, since they admit of the dis- 
play of a large superficial area (480 square feet) of drawings and other 
illustrations upon 35 square feet of floor space. 

These facts seem to be recognized, as we have frequent requests from 
persons interested in museum administration in this and other coun- 
tries for drawings of these styles of cases. To comply with such 
requests, cyanotypes and specifications showing the details of construc- 
tion have been prepared by Mr. J. E. Watkins, the engineer of prop- 
erty, for transmission to applicants. 

The following is a detailed list of cases, bases, frames, stands, appa- 
ratus, general appliances, fittings, etc., made or furnished during the 
year by persons outside the Museum :

During the first half of the year ending June 30, 1889, the time of the 
Museum carpenters was occupied to a considerable extent in making 
much needed and important changes in different parts of the building, 
whereby the number of rooms which could be used for office work was 
increased, and the space available for study scries of specimens, stor- 
age of books, documents, etc.. largely extended. 

Partitions were built in the third floor, northwest pavilion, and extra 
ceilings were put in ; in the southeast pavilion a ceiling with flooring

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 75 

above was built, thus giving an additional room for the accommodation 
ofthe Entomological Department. Much new shelving was put up in 
the different departments, the stationery room was re-arranged, new 
files and boo. cases were built for the Department of the Library } and a 
large number of cases, bases, frames, pedestals, etc., was built ami re- 
remodeled. 

in various places repairs have been found necessary in the flooring 
ofthe Museum, on account of the dry rot, which is becoming so exten- 
sive as to be a serious detriment. The bases of the cases standing 
directly upon the floor have also been found to be so much injured by 
the prevailing dry rot as to make it necessary to raise them upon blocks, 
pending the time when the bottoms of the cases can be repaired and 
strengthened, and, when practicable each article permanently raised 
upon casters. In order to prevent so far as possible any accumulation 
of dampness, which might cause this decay, the trenches below the 
building -have been thoroughly cleaned, and have received several coats 
of whitewash, but the tact that the floors throughout the building were 
laid in the damp concrete renders this precaution of little avail. It 
has, however, been taken every year since the Museum has been oc- 
cupied. 

BEATING AND LIGHTING. 

The appropriation for heating and lighting for the fiscal year ending 
•Tune 30, 1889, was $13,000. 

The services of telephone clerk, engineer and firemen for this year 
amount t<> $5,435; $4,188.43 has been spent for coal and wood; 
$1,188.37 for gas; $625.24 for electric work ; $800.1(5 for telephones; 
$120 for rental of call boxes; $638.81 for heating repairs ; making a 
total of $12,996.01, which leaves. May 1, 1890, an unexpended balance 
of $3.99. 

The average amount paid this year on the monthly roll for heating 
and lighting is $453. The greatest number of employes in any month 
is '.» ; the smallest, G; the average, 8. The highest salary is sll'O, paid 
to the engineer; the salaries of telephone clerk and firemen being uni- 
formly $50; the average salary is $59.08. 

The number of telephone calls made during the year is ">1 ,.'577. 

ELECTRICAL SERVICE. 

A change, which proves satisfactory, lias been made in the electrical 
service, by substituting for the clocks formerly used others which are 
run by the ( lardiner system, and which, being connected with the t T . S. 

Naval Observatory, are automatically regulated each day at noon. 

A ii important improvement in the engine room has been the repairing 
ofthe boiler, many of the tubes of which had become defective by Ion- 
use. New ones were obtained, and put into position by the regular 
firemen, who. being practical mechanics, were able to accomplish these 
repairs at a saving of a considerable expense to the Museum.

One of the reasons for the great increase in this branch of the Museum 
work is, that the letters addressed to the Smithsonian Institution relat- 
ing to anthropological and zoological subjects are, almost without ex- 
ception, referred to the Mueenm. Letters of this class are received 
daily from the Secretary, and the majority of the letters in reply are 
prepared for the Secretary's signature. 

The Museum receives a large number of offers to make explorations 
in various parts of the world, and to collect specimens for the codec-

W. Kockhill, Prof. I. C. Russell, aud Lieut. E. H. Taunt. 

Special reference to the results of their work is made under the head 
of " Exploration." 

A special feature of the routine work of this department is the 
method of indexing letters written. A card has been prepared on 
which is written the name and address of each correspondent, together 
with the number of the letter-books and pages in which all letters to a 
given person have been copied, including the date of each letter. By 
this means can be ascertained at a glance the amount of correspondence 
with any person. This has been found exceedingly convenient. More 
than five thousand of these cards have been filled up during the year 
relating to letters written since 1887. These cards are arranged alpha- 
betically and kept in long boxes divided into compartments, one or more 
of which are devoted, as required, to a single letter of the alphabet. 
Cross references are made under the name of the Government depart- 
ment or private establishment with which the person addressed may be 
connected. For instance, all letters written to any official in the Treas- 
ury Department are recorded on cards headed "Treasury Department," 
and another card is filed under the name of the person addressed. 
This is particularly convenient in the case of the Government depart- 
ments where changes of officials are more or less frequently ocurring.

BUILDINGS AND LABOR. — POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT. 

The staff employed for police and inspection has remained under the 
charge of Henry Horau, superintendent of buildings. 

From the reports of the superintendent are quoted in brief the follow- 
ing statements, which will serve to show in part the character of the 
work accomplished by the laboring force during the year : 

18S8. 

July. — During the first part of the mouth the mechanics aud laborers were occupied 
iu making preparations for the shipment of exhibits to the Cincinnati Exposition, 
which were finally shipped in twelve car-loads. Later in the month twenty-two 
boxes, containing the photographic exhibit, were forwarded by freight. This com- 
pleted the work of packing and shipping the exhibit from the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion. 

On July 9, the work of preparing material, packing and shipping an exhibit to the 
Marietta exposition was begun. This was completed on July 14. 

On July 1G, additional mechanics and laborers, who had been hired for work in 
connection with the Cincinnati exposition, were discharged. In order to afford better 
light in the main hall of the Smithsonian building, one end of each of the galleries 
was cut off. The fence inclosing the buffalo yard was painted. New steps were made 
and placed in the annex east entrance leading to the basement. 

Storage-cases for specimens were built for the Department of Ethnology ; two card- 
catalogue boxes for the executive clerk's office, and two cases for the metallurgical 
department. 

August. — Scaffolding was erected in the main hall of the Smithsonian building to 
facilitate the preparation of the walls and ceiling for painting. The painting of the 
exhibition hall of the Department of Fishes was finished. Iu the carpenter and paint 
shops, the following work has been completed : Construction of one large storage- 
case for unit trays, one frame for mounting tiles, cutting and fitting glass for cable- 
frames, putting mahogany casing around plaster casts ; making pedestals for the de- 
partment of mammals ; construction of two large tubs for holding trees in the rotunda. 
New mahogany label-frames were made. Mahogany panel ends have been put in 
four door-screen cases in the department of lithology. 

The alteration of the galleries in the main hall of the Smithsonian building has 
been continued this month. 

The followiug work has also been completed : Putting uew floor in the cafe" ; shel- 
lacing and painting wall cases; extending wall-cases and polishing specimen blocks 
for the department of comparative anatomy ; repairiug broken cases and making 
frames for the department of ethnology. For the executive clerk's office there has 
been made one case of drawers with shelving, and one case for letter-books. The 
refitting of doors to cases in several departments has been continued from day to day. 

September. — Several repairs in different parts of the Museum building and in the 
Armory building were rendered necessary by the results of a severe storm which oc- 
curred on September 10. The cases formerly occupying the wall space at the south 
entrauce of the Smithsonian building, were removed to the northeast court of the 
Museum building. A great many blocks for specimens have been painted and ebon- 
i zed for the various departntents, and the work of fitting shelves to cases has been 
continued. 

The platform in the lecture room has been repaired, and a large book-case made for 
the Department of Buildings and Labor. Five pier upright cases have been remod- 
eled for the Department of Ethnology, and several catalogue boxes have been made 
for the executive clerk's office. Oak frames for transparencies have been made. The 
office of the engineer of property has been furnished with a brass wire screen. The 
extension and remodeling of" the bird cases still continue.

building has been removed and replaced with plain glass. The radiators in the 
southeast court were removed from the walls to make room lor wall cases, and were 
placed I'uil her hack towards I lie center of the hall. This work necessitated some ex- 
cavating in connection with the fitting of the steam-pipes. Anew shed was built 
for the collection of living turtles and other specimens. Repairs were made to the 
floor in the southeast court. One of the upper rooms of the north tower in the Smith-

sonian building has been assigned to the Department of Mollusks, and shelving has 
been erected therein tor the storage of trays, etc., belonging to that, department. 
The halls and galleries in the Smithsonian building have been scoured and cleaned, 
and the furniture placed in order after the confusion incideni to the painting of the 
walls. The mechanics have also been occupied on the following work : making five 
hundred blocks tor the exhibition of medals : making frames for Assyrian slabs, and 
mahogany shelves for the Department of Mammals ; remodeling pier cases, and fitting 
them with shelves ; fitting drawers and locks to cases ; making drawers for storage

November. — Early in the month the Superintendent left Washington with six skilled 
laborers for Cincinnati for the purpose of packing and returning to the Museum the 
exhibits and cases sent to the Exposition. A force of men has been engaged in clean- 
ing out the sheds at the Armory and re-arranging the vast amount of material there 
stored. The tender belonging to the engine " John Bull " was brought over from the 
Armory and placed at the east entrance of the Museum building. The lecture hall was 
cleared to make room for the return of the exhibits from Cincinnati, which began to 
arrive on the 26th. On December 15, all this material was safely boused, aud the 
superintendent with his men returned to their duties in the Museum. The work of 
unpacking and returning the exhibits to their proper departments occupied the time 
of the entire laboring force for many days. After most of the above work was com- 
pleted, the Graphic Art exhibit, recently returned from Cincinnati, was installed in the 
lecture hall. During the latter part of this month many of the cases in the Anthropo- 
logical ball were re-arranged. Thocarpenters completed remodeling pier cases for use 
in the Department of Arts aud Industries. The following work was also accomplished: 
One book-case, with shelves, was made for the Department of Botany ; changing 
doors in unit tables in the Department of Botany ; making two oak book-cases for 
the Executive Department; constructing pigeon-holes for the Department of Building 
Stones ; also counter, drawers, and pigeon-holes for the office of the engineer of prop- 
erty ; adjusting locks and doors in floor cases in the southwest ball. The painters 
have been engaged in covering and painting diaphragms, lettering screens, aud var- 
nishing picture frames ; painting tubs for plants in the rotunda; painting the walls 
of the public comfort room ; glazing windows in the Smithsonian and Museum build- 
ings ; painting walls over the stairway in the east pavilion ; finishing in hard oil a 
large book-case for the executive clerk's office ; painting cases for the Department of 
Property aud Supplies. 

December. — Ash screens to be placed on the top of the cases in the south-west court have 
been made. The west hall has been re-arranged and the lecture hall put in order for 
the meetings of the American Historical Association. Eleven door screen cases have 
been furnished to the curator of birds. These will take the place of the old white 
cases in the center of the hall, which will be condemned as soon as the specimens have 
been removed. Theold storm door at the north entrance to the Museum building has 
been removed to the east entrance, and larger and more serviceable ones have been 
placed at the north entrance. The following work has also been accomplished : Con-

THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS. 

The preparation of specimens for exhibition in the Museum and for 
the study series has been satisfactorily continued. The work of mod- 
eling is in charge of Mr. W. T. Hornaday, chief taxidermist. 

TAXIDERMISTS AND MODELERS. 

The operations of the department in preparing groups of mammals 
have been greatly hampered by the vast amount of other necessary 
routine work, but considerable progress has been made with several 
groups which it is expected will be completed during the coming year. 

These groups are : 

Gray Squirrels. — Part of this group was completed for the Cincinnati 
Exposition, but owing to lack of space it was not sent. It has now 
been decided to increase its size, incorporating in it all that it is pos- 
sible to exhibit of the life history of the squirrels, thus making it more 
comprehensive and instructive. 

Red Squirrels. — What is stated of the gray-squirrel group applies 
to this group also. 

Red and Gray Foxes. — Some work has been done on these groups, but 
more material has yet to be collected. 

Rabbits. — Material has been collected for this group, and it will be 
one of the first finished. 

Moose. — Considerable work has been done on this large and important 
group. The manikins for three of the six animals of which this group 
will be composed, have been made, and it is the intention to bring it to 
completion at an early date. The group will occupy a special case of 
the same dimensions as that containing the group of buffaloes. 

In addition to the work mentioned above, a portion of the necessary 
materials for several other groups have been collected and designs 
drawn. These groups will include the Rocky Mountain Goat, Rocky 
Mountain Sheep, Musk-ox, Beaver, Raccoon, and Woodchuck. 

The Opossum and Prairie-Dog groups have been put in their new 
cases and the Orang-outang group retouched. The Antelope group 
was sent to the Cincinnati Exposition. When a new case for this group 
has been made, it is intended to add several specimens of different ages, 
and to rearrange it for exhibition.

Sixty fresh specimens of mammals received during the year and fifty 
alcoholic specimens were skinned and preserved. Of the sixty fresh 
animals skinned, thirty-three were collected by the taxidermists, fif- 
teen were received from the Department of Living Animals, and twelve 
from the Mammal Department. Thirty-eight skins were also received, 
dry and alcoholic. There has been some progress in making up into 
good dry skins the duplicate material on hand. A beginuing has also 
been made in reducing the number of alcoholic specimens by working 
them over into dry skins for the reserve collection. 

The following statement relates to dry skins which have been made 
during the year :

A number of porpoise casts sent to the Cincinnati Exposition having 
been returned more or less injured, it was decided to put them in good 
condition, and also to overhaul others on exhibition and in storage. 
This work has been done almost entirely by Mr. Joseph Palmer and 
Mr. A. H. Forney. A list of these is as follows, about a dozen remain- 
ing to be completed another year :

MISCELLANEOUS WORK OK THE TAXIDERMISTS. 

Collection of domestic animate. — For inany years it has been custom- 
ary to include in the exhibits of the Mammal and Bird Departments 
such specimens of domestic animals as may be received. During the 
past year it has been decided to form a separate collection uuder the 
above name, and the various specimens on hand have been brought 
together, renovated, and exhibited in a large wall case iu the Section 
of Animal Products. 

The collection is composed as follows : G mammals (llama, sheep, 
dog, cat, etc.), 31 ducks and geese, 86 domestic fowls; a total of 123 
specimens. 

These have all been thoroughly cleaned, poisoned, and placed on new 
stands. A number of other animals have also been received for this 
collection and will be placed on exhibition as soon as they are mounted. 

In connection with the return of the exhibi ts from the Cincinnati Ex 
position considerable work was done by the taxidermists. Mr. A. H. 
Forney was sent to Cincinnati to unpack and install the exhibits of 
mammals. This consisted of some sixty boxes, with over one hundred 
and fifty specimens, which, on their return, were unpacked, cleaned, and, 
when necessary, repaired. 

The space in the Museum occupied by the taxidermic exhibit was 
needed for the collection of domestic animals, and it became necessary 
therefore to remove it. This has been done, but the collection does 
not show to good advantage in its present position. New and larger 
cases are desirable. When more room is obtained, it is intended to 
make the collection far more complete than at present. 

The following gentlemen have been instructed in taxidermy during 
the year, especially in the art of making good dry skins: Mr. William 
Taylor, of San Diego, Texas; Lieut. Emory H. Taunt, U. S. N., repre- 
sentative of the United States in the Congo region; and Mr. Harry 
Perry, who expects to spend several years in Honduras. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 107 

A tanned skin of an albino buffalo calf was received from Lieut. 
Colonel Kellogg. II was cleaned, poisoned, and placed on exhibition 
in the fur collection. Five boxes of specimens were packed for ship- 
ment. Nine mounted mammals have been repaired, poisoned, and put 
in good condition. Two seals and a large walrus were placed on new 
stands. Casts have been made of six bodies or parts of bodies of mam- 
mals received in the flesh. These are often of great assistance in 
mounting - , since the}- furnish the best idea of the size and shape of 
the species. Quite a number of these are now on hand and form a 
very interesting and instructive collection. 

Congress having provided for the fitting up of the Armory building 
for the use of the Fish Commission, the third floor of that building has 
been reserved for the modelers and taxidermists of the Museum. It 
became necessary therefore to remove this department from the second 
and fourth floors to new rooms on the third floor. This department 
now occupies three rooms in the Armory building, a shed outside, con- 
taining the collection of pickled skins, and a number of storage rooms 
in the Smithsonian basement, containing molds and casts. 



MODELING AND PAINTING. 

Mr. J. W. Hendley has continued his work during the year. For the 
Department of Transportation he has made two lay figures, an In- 
dian hunter on snow shoes with gun in one hand and three birds in the 
other, and an Eskimo seated on a sled. He has repainted a Japanese 
carrying-box. For the food collection he lias cast and painted a beef- 
steak, a platter of butter, two loaves of bread, and repaired a num- 
ber of articles. For the Department of Ethnology he has repaired and 
cleaned seventy small statuettes, cast and painted thirteen implements, 
made ten casts of Assyrian seals, together with numerous flat impres- 
sions of the same. For other departments : Eight casts of fossil shark's 
teeth, nine casts of fossil bones, casts of contents of two jars of phos- 
phorus, repaired and painted cast of skull of the fossil bull (Bos tints), 
made fourteen casts of a rare trilobite, and of numerous minor objects. 

Mr. Joseph Palmer has done very little taxidermic work during the 
year, most of his time having been taken up in work on the series of 
porpoise casts, and in casting and setting up large casts of antique 
objects. A statement of the most important work accomplished is as 
follows: Several weeks were spent in changing and repairing the orna- 
mentation of the columns in the Smithsonian building. A complete set 
of casts was made from the molds of Assyrian antiquities, taken at the 
Fairfax Seminary, Virginia. He repaired and set up for exhibition a 
series of Assyrian and Egyptian easts, received from Berlin, twenty live 
large and small specimens; repaired and painted a bust of the King of 
Siam, and made a east of the Indian chief Osceola; made a mold and 



108 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

cast of the Siloom inscription, and made a cast of the memorial medal- 
lion of Prof. Joseph Henry. Only a few molds of animals have been 
made during the year, but these have been very important. 

A Bottle-nosed whale (Mesoplodon bidens) was received whole, and a 
complete mold of both sides was made, as also a separate mold of the 
head with the month open. The largest of the specimens of the Gala- 
pagos tortoises, collected by the Fish Commission steamer Albatross, 
died in the Department of Liviug Animals, and a mold was made from 
it. These molds are stored with others, and will be cast in due time. 

OSTEOLOGICAL PREPAEATOR. 

Mr. F. A. Lucas, Assistant Curator in the Department of Compara- 
tive Anatomy, reports that the work of the past year has been very 
largely devoted to the preparation of material, and to the care of that 
already in the collection. 

The enlargement of the large exhibition case in the osteological hall, 
and necessary alterations in the small case, have necessitated the mov- 
ing of the entire series of specimens on exhibition and their complete 
re-arrangement. 

The preparation of a much-needed card catalogue of alcoholic birds 
has been commenced and is well advanced, and a large amount of work 
has been done in classifying and caring for this valuable portion of the 
collection. 

Some work has been done in the preparation of specimens of soft 
anatomy, and some on invertebrate material, while the greater portion 
of one month was passed in arranging vertebrate fossils, and in pre- 
paring them for exhibition. 

The cast of a skeleton of Dinoceras, received from the Yale College 
Museum has been mouted. 

At the close of the Cincinnati Exposition the entire labor of packing- 
all the zoological material there exhibited by the Departments of Mam- 
mals, Birds, Insects, and Comparative Anatomy was performed under 
Mr. Lucas's direction, and the collections reached Washington in good 
condition. 

The skeleton of a whale exhibited at Cincinnati was, on its return, 
again hung from the ceiling of the Museum. Another whale skeleton 
acquired by the Museum has also been put in place, and a third has 
been moved to a new location in the osteological hall, and there sus- 
pended from the wall on a plan devised by Mr. Lucas. 

The following table gives a summary of the material received and of 
the work of preparation during the year :

PHOTOGRAPHER. 



Mr. T. W. Sniillie reports that 253 negatives have been added to the 
permanent files. Of these, 88 related to ethnology. 116 to prehistoric 
anthropology, 11 to mammals, 3 to osteology, 21 to transportation, 10 
to graphic arts, and 181 to miscellaneous subjects. Thirty-nine trans- 
parencies were also made. 

The number of priuts made daring the year is 2,199, distributed as 
follows: ethnological, 190; anthropological, 138; mammals, 22; osteo- 
logical, 3; transparencies, 77; graphic arts, 10; miscellaneous, 1,759. 
In addition to this 23 enlargements have been made ; 39 cyanotypes 
have been printed, and a collection of miscellaneous photographs, 113 
in number, have been mounted. 

The following special work for the U. S. Fish Commission has also 
been performed: Negatives made, 22; silver albumen prints, 22; cyan- 
otypes, 476. 

The usual routine work of numbering and filing negatives, making 
up outfits for expeditions, etc., has been continued. 

By request of the Postmaster-General and by order of the Assistant 
Secretary, a number of samples of canceling inks have been tested 
for the Post-Office Department. 

The illustrating of the lectures given in the National Museum has 
been conducted by means of the stereopticon operated by the photog- 
rapher and his assistants. 

A collection intended to show the uses of photography was pre- 
pared for exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposition. This collection in- 
cluded valuable contributions of photographs from Prof. E. C. Picker- 
ing, of Harvard University, Mr. J. W. Osborne, of Washington, and 
from several officers connected with the Government service, notably, 
the Geodetic and Coast Survey: the Light- House Board ; the Army 
Medical Museum, and the proving ground at Annapolis. At the close 
of the Exposition this collection was returned to the Museum and is 
now being prepared, in connection with additional material which has

historical collection in which shall be shown examples of every photo- 
graphic process that has been invented, together with the appliances 
used, beginning with the photograph of the solar spectrum, as made 
by Scheele in 1777, and showing each step in the evolution of photog- 
raphy from that time to the present day. Considerable material has 
already been gathered which will be incorporated in this collection. 

The first camera made in the United States has been acquired by 
purchase. A stereoscope, containing daguerreotypes and transparencies 
by the old albumen process on glass, was presented by Mrs. E. J. Stone. 
The Scoville Manufacturing Company of New York, presented a series 
of cameras showing the latest improvements, and from the Eastman 
Dry-Plate Company of Rochester, New York, has been received a 
Kodak camera, together with a series of enlarged photographs, illus- 
trating its use. 

The following students have been instructed in photography : Lieut. 
E. H. Taunt, U. S. N., Mr. W. H. Perry, Miss Frances B. Johnston, 
Dr. T. H. Bean, Mr. Howard, and Professor J. B. Daish. 

In the year 1887, Mr. Smillie was transferred from the IT. S. Fish 
Commission to the National Museum as chief photographer. From 
that time the photographic work of the Fish' Commission has been 
done in the Museum on the following conditions : 

The Commissioner furnishes an assistant, as well as the material and 
apparatus necessary for the work of the Commission. The work of the 
assistant is under the supervision of the photographer of the Museum, 
who makes the requisitions for material, and keeps a record of the 
work done. In return, the assistant paid by the Fish Commission is 
expected to assist in work for the Museum, when not occupied in the 
interest of the Commission.

DRAUGHTSMEN. 

Beginning with the year 1884, the report of the National Museum 
has consisted of a separate volume, and a section of eacli report has, 
since and including that year, been devoted to the publication of papers 
illustrative of collections in the National Museum. Many of these 
papers have been illustrated by both photographs and drawings. 
The former have been made by Mr. T. W. Smillie, photographer. It 
has been more satisfactory in certain cases to have drawings of the ob- 
jects prepared in the Museum, especially in connection with the illustra- 
tion of the following papers : In Report for 1884 : " Throwing-sticks in 
the National Museum", by Otis T. Mason (17 plates) ; " Basket-work of 
the North American Aborigines," by Otis T. Mason (64 plates); "A 
study of the Eskimo bows in the U. S. National Museum," by John Mur- 
doch (12 plates) ; "The West Indian Seal," by Frederick W. True and 
F. A. Lucas (3 plates). In Report for 1886 : " How to collect Mammal 
skins for purposes of study and for mounting," by William T. Hornaday 
(0 figures). In Report for 1887 : " Cradles of the American Aborigines," 
by Otis T. Mason (45 figures) ; "The Human Beast of Burden," by Otis 
T. Mason (54 figures) ; " Ethuo-Conchology— -A Study of Primitive 
Money," by Robert E. C. Stearns (9 plates and 22 text figures) ; "The 
Extermination of the American Bison," by William T. Hornaday (12 
plates and 1 map). In the Report for 1888 : " The Indians of the North- 
west Coast," by Ensign A. P. Xiblack (70 plates and 48 text figures) ; 
"Fire-making apparatus in the National Museum," by Walter Hough 
(8 plates and 60 text figures). 

Illustrations for papers on " Eskimo Strike-a-Light," by Walter Hough; 
" Skin Scrapers," by Otis T. Mason ; and " Easter Island," by Paymaster 
William J. Thomson, U. S. Navy, are now being prepared. 

The drawings for the greater part of these* illustrations have been 
made by Mr. W. H. Chandlee and Mr. W. H. Burger, both of wiiora are 
in the employ of the Museum, and have been especially assigned to the 
Department of Ethnology, from which department have emanated the 
larger proportion of illustrated papers. 

A great deal of time has been occupied in piece work connected with 
general administration and covering the entire field of draughting, em- 
bracing topographical and architectural work, tracings and sketch maps, 
engrossing, lettering, table designing, sketching of articles temporarily 
in the Museum, coloring of maps and charts, and artistic color work. 
For these purposes the following mediums were required: oil-colors and 
water-colors (transparent and opaque), pens and ink, lead pencils, cray- 
ous (Conte and lithographic), charcoal, and lamp-black.

The decrease in the number of the accessious this year may be ac- 
counted for in part by refusals of collections which have been necessi- 
tated owing to lack of both storage and exhibition room. 

A geographical statement has been prepared, showing the sources of 
the more important accessions.

H.— SPECIMENS SENT FOR EXAMINATION AND REPORT. 

A large number of specimens are received each year for examination 
and report. A separate record of these is kept. When specimens thus 
received are worthy of addition to the collections, they are entered on 
the accession record, and receive a number in the accession series. No 
less than three hundred and forty-seven lots of specimens of this kind 
were received during the year. In each case the specimens are exam- 
ined by the curator to whose department they relate, and he submits a 
formal report upon them. A copy of this is transmitted to the sender. 
A list* of these specimens received is here given together with an 
index arranged by localities. It should be stated, perhaps, that the 
object of printing this list is the same as for printing the list of letters 
asking for information, which has been already explained on p. 88.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 137 

I.— CO-OPERATION OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND BUREAUS 

OF THE GOVERNMENT. 

The National Museum has continued to enjoy the friendly eo opera- 
tion of the departments and bureaus of the Government, and many of 
them have contributed very liberally to the collections of the Museum 
daring the year. In addition to the contribution of specimens, a wide 
interest in the affairs of the Museum has been manifested. The most 
extensive aid to the Museum, as far as the receipt of collections is con- 
cerned, has been rendered by the U. S. Geological Survey, whose work 
is iu many ways closely allied to that of the Museum. The co-operation 
of officers of the War and Navy Departments has been especially con- 
spicuous and gratifying - , and the Department of State, particularly 
through the agency of its consuls, has contributed largely to the inter- 
esting material received during the year. 

DEPARTMENT OF STATE. 

Hon. T. F. Bayard, Secretary of State, sent photographs of Indians 
of the Goajira Peninsula, which forms the extreme northwestern part 
of Venezuela. 

Hon. A. L. Rives, First Assistant Secretary of State, sent a collec- 
tion of water-color sketches and photographs of Samoan scenery and 
life. 

Iron ore, coal, coke, and specimens of shale from Brazil were re- 
ceived through Hon. A. A. Adee, Assistant Secretary of State. 

A valuable and interesting collection of textile fabrics of wool, 
worsted, silk, cotton, mohair, and alpaca was received through Hon. 
William Grinnell, United States consul, at Bradford, England. 

Twenty-four specimens of ores were transmitted by Hon. Otto E. 
Reimer, United States consul at Santiago de Cuba. 

Consul Mason, at Marseilles, sent an interesting series of samples of 
ramie. 

The United States consul at Sydney, New South Wales, sent samples 
of Australian wool. 

A package of engravings illustrating the breeds of foreign cattle, 
slice)), and swine, were received from Mr. J. Fenner Lee, chief clerk. 

Through the courtesy of the Department facilities have been ex- 
tended to collectors for the National .Museum by means of letters of 
introduction to ministers and other officials in the countries to be visited, 
and in other ways. 

TREASURY DEPARTMENT. 

The Treasury Department has bestowed the usual courtesies in pass- 
ing, fiee of entry, material sent from abroad and intended for the 
Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum. The thanks of the 



138 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Museum are due to the Department for its friendly office* in affording 
facilities to collectors and explorers in behalf of the Museum. The 
Light-House Board, the Life- Saving Service, the U. S. Coast and Geo- 
detic Survey, and the Revenue Marine Division have ea<;h contributed 
interesting specimens to the Museum, and have in various ways facili- 
tated the work of some one or more of the departments in the Museum. 

Life-Saving Service. — Hon. S. I. Kimball, Superintendent of the Life- 
Saving Service, has aided the Museum by giving instructions to the

fresh specimen of Sowerby's whale (Mesoplodon bidens), from Capt. J. 
L. Gaskill, keeper of the Absecom Life-Saving station, Atlantic City. 
William H. Gaskill, keeper of the Cape Lookout Life-Saving station, 
North Carolina, transmitted a fresh specimen of Sunfish (Mola mola). 

Light-Rouse Board. — A collection of blue prints of lamps and flames, 
illustrating the illuminating system of the Light-House Service, was 
sent, at the request of the Museum, for exhibition at the Cincinnati 
Exposition, and formed an important feature of the photographic ex- 
hibit of the Museum on that occasion. W. M. Quinn, keeper of the 
Cape Sanbias Light-House station, Florida, sent a collection of turtles. 

Revenue Marine Division. — A valuable and interesting collection of 
photographs of the natives and scenery of Alaska, taken by the officers 
of the revenue steamer Bear, was lent to the Museum by Mr. Peter 
Bonnett, chief of the division. 

Secret Service Division. — A collection of photographs of counterfeiters 
was, through the kindness of Mr. John S. Bell, chief of the division, 
lent to the Museum for exhibition at Cincinnati, for the purpose of illus- 
trating the uses to which photography had been applied in connection 
with the requirements of the Government service.

showing the methods of mounting photographic exhibits. Specimens 
of marine invertebrates, fishes, mollusks, and insects collected at Cape 
Sable, Florida, were transmitted to the Museum. 

Several specialists engaged in making collections for the Museum 
have, through the courtesy of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, 
been supplied with charts of the regions along the coast to be explored. 

WAR DEPARTMENT. 

The Museum has received valuable aid from this Department in many 
ways, especially through the Quartermaster's Department of the Army.

DEPARTMENT <>F THE INTERIOR. 

U. 8. Geological Survey.— The Museum acknowledges with gratitude 
and pleasure the valuable assistance of the Survey, whose operations 
are in many respects closely related to the work of the Museum. The 
researches of the geologists connected with the Survey are of especial 
value by reason of the large collections which are made, and which 
after being worked over and described are transferred to the Museum 
collections. The past year has been, perhaps, as notable as any in the 
acquirement by the Museum of valuable and interesting collections 
from this source, as will be seen from the appended statement.

J.— EXPLORATIONS. 

The collections of the National Museum have received valuable ad- 
ditions through, the co operation of several -cut lemen \\ bo have offered 



144 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

to make special researches in its behalf, or who have allowed the Mn 
seum to share the results of their explorations. The most itnportant- 
of these are here briefly referred to. 

Early in the present year Mr. Talcott Williams, of Philadelphia, vis- 
ited the northern part of Africa, and kindly offered in behalf of the 
Smithsonian Institution to make special inquiries in regard to the civ- 
ilization of the modern Arab and the natural history of the region ; 
also to collect linguistic specimens. His plan was to go direct to 
Tangiers, thence to Fez and Mequinez, continuing, if possible, as far 
as Mogador and Morocco. Mr. Williams's knowledge of the Arabic 
language aided him greatly in his investigations in the country, and 
through his endeavors the Institution will no doubt obtain collec- 
tions, as well as information, of extreme value. Botany, geology, and 
archaeology are the special studies to which Mr. Williams intends to 
devote himself. At the time of his arrival the North African flora was 
in flower, and, as his plan was to travel for two or three weeks on horse- 
back, his opportunities in the first direction were excellent. The geol- 
ogy of north Africa is imperfectly represented in the National Museum, 
therefore characteristic rocks and photographs of features of physical 
geology will be of great value. The archaeology of this region is, how- 
ever, the subject of the highest importance to the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, and to which Mr. Williams has promised chiefly to direct his 
attention. He hopes to visit El Kutel, one of the most striking mono- 
lithic remains in north Africa, aud Other interesting ruins. He has 
been furnished with a photographic outfit, photographs aud measure- 
ments being particularly desired. He has been provided with a com- 
plete outfit of instruments for taking observations of temperature and 
altitudes. A preliminary report of the work accomplished has been 
received in the form of a letter to the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution, and is here printed : 

Tangiers, Morocco, June 17, 1889. 
Sir : I have the honor to make a preliminary report upon the commission intrusted 
to me in Morocco. 

(1) The collection of musical instruments of north Morocco is, I trust, complete. 
It includes every instrument in use, making six stringed instruments, six wind, and 
four of percussion, with varieties of each ranging from the rudest bayi whistle to 
stringed instruments which require the utmost skill in manufacture. In each instru- 
ment the native name and the native names of all its parts have been noted, the pitch 
of each string in the stringed and the range of each wind instrument, as tuned and 
played by professional native musicians, has been taken and the air and melody of 
a native tune played on each instrument has been noted by a competent musician in 
our own musical notation. 

Aside from this incidental contribution to folk music I know no instance where a 
museum catalogue or label gives the particulars I have mentioned of Oriental musical 
instruments. 

(2) With reference to the Arab teut, I found, after careful examination, that the 
Arab tribes whom I visited have been so altered by a semi-sedentary life, living half 
and sometimes all the year in one place, and raising grain, that a tent would be mis- 
leading and reflect only the current agricultural life of this country. J therefore did 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 145 

not procure oue. The fringe of unsettled region which separates the true Arab from 
settled regions is here a wide one, and this plan of the Museum, which is altogether 
feasible, can only be carried out at some point like Aden and the upper Nile, say at 
YVady Haifa-Tripoli or near the present work of the Babylonian Expedition, of Penn- 
sylvania University, where the true nomad Arab is within a few hours of an Amer- 
ican agent. Modification in this type is in rapid progress, and in a few years it will 
be too late. 

(3) I have been aide to lind but one book in the Berber language in the possession 
of an European. Nearly every one, including native scholars and European residents 
oflong standing, have told me that they have never heard of one. The utmost I have 
been able to secure is a leaf or two of an old Berber manuscript on Moslem law, which 
is, I think, unique. 

(4) A large share of my purchases has therefore been of "simple utensils." A 
full list, erivine in each case the native name of each article, will be transmitted later. 
The chief objects I have sought to illustrate are, in brief — 

The lamp in ordinary use here is the " Roman lamp " form, and I have this from a 
rude metal up through a series of elaborate brass forms. 

Fires are built in small pots. These range from eartheuware shaped by hand, 
through successive additions to a tall iron stove. 

The preparation of food is illustrated among other phases by a complete set with 
samples of the plant used in making cooscoosu, the national dish. 

The ground palm, Chamcerops humile, plays a most important part in domestic 
economy, nowhere noted, and this is illustrated in all stages of its leaf and liber. 

Comb manufactures, giving carpenter's tools, form a single compact exhibit with 
photographs, and this is supplemented by a primitive lathe. 

The Fry pottery offers an unusual instance of a local pottery unaffected by modern 
methods, and a full set of its patterns are included. 

There are also a number of lesser articles, of which an interesting one is the sur- 
vival of the wooden sword, unnoticed by any previous traveler. 

Three costumes have been purchased : (1) Fry woman ; (2) mountaineer man ; (3) 
mountaineer woman. 

In each case the native name of each article is noted, an omission which robs many 
museum costumes of an important linguistic value. 

I send in addition three hundred species of (lowering plants and fossils from three 
localities, from none of which have they been collected before. 

A small shipment was made from Teheran and another from here will be sent later 
of seven boxes and one bundle, the invoice", etc., of which I have transmitted to Mr. 
G. Brown Goode.

The list which I will also send later will give careful notes on each article. The 
notes on the musical instruments may not be sent until I return. 

When transportation, etc., is paid, the sum in my hands will be exhausted, and an 

account of the same will be duly transmitted. 

I am, very respectfully, yours truly, 

Talcott Williams. 

Hon. S. P. Langley, 

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 

At the request of Mr. Williams the examination of the contents of 
his collections will be deferred until be arrives. In the next report a 
complete list of the collection will probably be published. 

Mr. YV*. W. Bockhill, formerly of the American Legation of Pekin, has 
recently undertaken a journey through Thibet, with a view to making a 
special study of the ethnology of that region, having already made him- 
self familiar with the customs of the natives. The Smithsonian Institu- 
tion has supplied him with a barometer and other instruments desired by 
him for his journey. His previous investigations have resulted in an 
exceedingly valuable collection of objects, illustrating the religious oc- 
cupations and amusements of the various peoples in different parts of 
China, Thibet, and Turkestan. Among those from Thibet are a number 
of prayer-wheels, a divination bowl made from a human skull, a sprink- 
ler for holy water, a Lama's drum, a bell and score-book used in re- 
ligious worship, an exercising flute made from a human femur, a rosary 
of one hundred and eight beads made from bones of human skulls, a 
charm box and sacred books, images and scroll pictures of gods. From 
Western China and Mongolia are carved rosaries, and figures of gods 
supposed to preside over medicines, riches, etc. From Northern Tur- 
kestan is a scroll picture showing the occupations and sports of the 
people. 

Dr. James Grant Bey, who some years ago established a sanitarium 
at Cairo, Egypt, attended the International Medical Congress held in 
Washington in 1887, and was much interested in the work of the Na- 
tional Museum. He has, since his return to Egypt, devoted his leisure 
time to special studies of the arts of the ancient Egyptians. Several 
very valuable collections have been received from him, among which 
are the following objects : Fifteen fragments of the Egyptian " Book of 
the Dead" in Hieratic, seven water-color sketches of ancient lamps, 
many ancient coins of various sorts, a modern Arabic almanac for the 
year Hegira 1300, containing autograph, two gold ornaments of Thoth- 
mes III, flower of the Nymphcea cerulea, the lotos of Upper Egypt, a 
beetle from Thebes, and many other objects of value and interest. 

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin was sent, during the summer, by the Bureau of 
Ethnology to the Hupa Reservation in California, in order to study the 
languages and mythology of the tribes of Indians inhabiting the reser- 
vation. The Smithsonian Institution was fortunate enough to secure 
the assistance of Mr. Curtin in investigating their arts and industries 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 1-17 

as well. A small sum of money was placed in his hands for the pur 
chase of objects to complete the series of the Museum collection from 
this region. 

Dr. John M. Crawford, United States Consul-General at St. Peters- 
burgh, expects to make extensive ethnological researches in Russia and 
Finland, and has generously offered to allow t he National Museum to 
participate in the results. Dr. Crawford is well known as the author of 
the English translation of the Finnish epic "The Kalevala," as a philol- 
ogist and a student of Scandinavian antiquities. His acquirements in 
these directions led to his being appointed Consul-General at St. Peters- 
burgh, from which place he would be able to carry on his studies of the 
Finnish race, and related peoples. Letters of introduction to several 
correspondents in Russia and Finland, have been furnished by the 
Smithsonian Institution in order to facilitate his work. 

Rev. Frederick II. Post, late rector of St. Paul's Church, Salem, Ore- 
gon, has recently assumed charge of the mission of the Episcopal 
Church at Anvik on the Yukon River, Alaska. He is. very much inter- 
ested in the study of natural science and history, and has offered to 
serve the Smithsonian Institution in collecting information relating to 
the tribes of the Upper Yukon, and also in transmitting to the Museum 
specimens, of the mammals and birds of that region. It is probable 
that Mr. Post will, next year, be furnished with an outfit of alcohol, 
guns, and ammunition. 

Lieut. J. F. .Moser, commanding the 17. S. Coast Survey steamer Backe, 
has continued his explorations for the Museum and has sent a collection 
of fishes, mollusks, insects, and marine invertebrates from the viciuity 
of Cape Sable, Florida. 

Prof. O. P. Jenkins. <>!' De Pauw University, Indiana, proposes to visit 
the Hawaiian Islands during the summer for the purpose of collecting 
fishes, and has kindly offered to present a duplicate series of specimens 
to the .Museum. To aid him in this undertaking tin? Smithsonian Insti- 
tution has supplied him with seines, giving him also a letter of intro- 
duction to the curator of the National Museum in Honolulu. 

I during the summerof L888, Mr. George P. Merrill, Curator of Geology, 
made a collecting trip to North Carolina, Pennsylvania. New York. Ver- 
ba on t, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maine. Large collections 
of rock were obtained for the Museum. 

Mr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of Prehistoric Anthropology, visited 
mounds in Ohio, and made interesting collections. 

In August Dr. \Y. F. Hillebrand, of the U. S. Geological Survey, vis- 
ited some of the Western States ana Territories, partly with a view to 
making collections of minerals. These will eventually be incorporated 
with the Museum collections. 

In order to further the work of those who have expressed their willing- 
ness to collect specimens for the Museum, as well as those who have been 

Bent out as collectors by the Museum, outfits of apparatus, tanks, al 






148 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889 



cohol, etc., have been supplied. Daring the year the outfits here indi- 
cated have been furnished to the following-uanied collectors: 

188S. 

August 3. — Mr. W. A. Stearns, of Cainbridgeport, Massachusetts, was supplied with 
a large outfit of tanks, dredge-nets, tin tags, pig bladders, bottles, vials, cheese-cloth, 
heavy paper, and a double-barrel shot-gun, for use in collecting natural history speci- 
mens for the National Museum in northern Labrador. It has been found necessary 
to postpone this expedition until next summer. 

December 19. — Lieut. J. F. Moser, commanding the U. S. Coast Survey steamer 
Bache, has been furnished with tanks, packing-boxes, jars, etc. He has transmitted 
a collection of fishes, mollusks, insects, and marine invertebrates to the National 
Museum from the vicinity of Cape Sable, Florida, and has kindly signified his will- 
ingness to make additional collections, as opportunity may offer. 

1889. 

•January 15. — Capt. W. L. Carpenter, who for many years has sent to the Smith- 
sonian Institution collections of natural history specimens, is now stationed at Pres- 
cott, Arizona. He has kindly promised to continue his efforts in behalf of the Museum, 
in collecting fishes, reptiles, marine invertebrates, etc., for the preservation of which 
tanks and alcohol have been furnished. 

January 18. — Lieut. E. H. Taunt, of Washington, District of Columbia, has offered 
to collect mineral specimens in connection with his cruise to the Congo River, South 
Africa. He has been supplied with a photographic apparatus by the Smithsonian 
Institution, 

February 4. — Dr. L. F. H. Birt, of Greytown, Nicaragua, Central America, having 
in the past sent large collections of mammals, reptiles, fishes, birds, etc., to the 
National Museum, has been supplied with tanks and alcohol for the continuance of 
his services. Dr. Birt proposes to direct his attention later to the fishes and Crustacea 
of the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts of this country, the results of which he will share 
with the Smithsonian Institution. 

March 28. — Lieut. W. L. Howard, of San Francisco, California, offered to collect 
fishes and ethnological objects in Alaska for the Smithsonian Institution. To aid 
him in this undertaking the Institution has supplied him with tanks, alcohol and 
trade-supplies. 

May 22. — An outfit of alcohol, a gun, and ammunition was supplied to Mr. I. C. 
Russell, of San Francisco, California, to aid him in his Alaska Expedition. The 
Alaska Commercial Company also afforded facilities to Mr. Russell, introducing him 
1o its agent at St. Michael. 

May 27.— Hon. Charles Bartlett, United States consul at Guadaloupe, West Indies, 
sent a number of brilliantly luminous insects, among them the "Cueujo" (Pyropho- 
rus noctilucus) for purposes of analysis. A number of insect-boxes were sent to him, 
and also to Seiior Jose C. Zeledon of San Jose, Costa Rica, and Senor Ferrari Perez, 
City of Mexico, for the same purpose. 

June 8. — Tanks and alcohol were sent to Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, of Tacoma, District 
of Columbia, in which place, he states, the opportunity is excellent to collect a num- 
ber of embryo birds, many of which will greatly assist him in working out the mor- 
phology of the group. Dr. Shufeldt kindly offers to collect specimens for the National 
Museum. 

June 11. — An outfit of tanks, alcohol, and shellac was sent to Mr. Frank Burns, of 
the U. S. Geological Survey. 

.James Mooney, of Cherokee, North Carolina, was supplied with tanks and alcohol. 
No collections have as yet been received. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 149 

Mr. C. R. Orcntt, of San Diego, California, lias, from time to time, transmitted to 
tin' National Museum valuable collections of fishes, reptiles, fossils, marine inverte- 
brates, etc., from California. During the past year he has been supplied with tanks, 
alcohol, jars, and a seine for this purpose. 

Mr. W. Harvey Brown, of the National Museum, was appointed naturalist to ac- 
company the United States Eclipse Expedition to South Africa. Being in the employ 
of the Smithsonian Institution he was furnished with a large outfit of tanks, alcohol, 
jars, oil, linen, and tools. It is probable that the next report will contain au account 
of the results of this expedition. 

June 13. — Prof. O. P. Jenkins, of Do Pauw University, Indiana, intends to visit the 
Hawaiian Islands, and has been supplied with seines to aid him in collecting fishes, 
a duplicate set of which ho has expressed his intention of presenting to the National 
.Museum. 

December 29. — Dr. John I. Northrup received an outfit of tanks and alcohol to use 
during his visit to the Bahama Islands, where he expects to collect plants and ani- 
mals, especially'marine invertebrates and fishes. He offers to present a duplicate set 
of specimens to the Sinithsoniau Institution. 



K.— REPORTS UPON THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SMITH- 
SONIAN INSTITUTION AND THE NATIONAL MUSEUM 
IN THE EXPOSITIONS HELD AT CINCINNATI AND 
MARIETTA IN 1888. 

Letter from the Assistant Secretary to the /Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution, relating to the participation of the Institution in the Cin- 
cinnati Exposition. 

May 7, 1889. 
Sir : I have the honor to report that all work in connection with the 
participation of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum 
in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, 
held in Cincinnati in 1888, has now been completed. All objects sent 
to Cincinnati have been returned to their proper places and damages 
suffered by specimens and furniture have been repaired to as great 
an extent as has been found practicable under the arbitrary and un- 
usually stringent rulings of the Treasury officials in charge of the dis- 
bursements and account. 

I transmit herewith a report (Appendix A) upon the Smithsonian 
participation in the Exposition, which has been prepared by Mr. R. 
Edward Earll, who was plaited in charge of the administrative work at 
Cincinnati, it having been impossible for me to be absent from Wash- 
ington during the continuance of the Exposition, and who performed 
the responsible and difficult duties of his position in an exceedingly 
efficient and faithful manner. 

In his report a history of our work is given, and also a history of 
what was done by the various departments of the Museum and by the 
Bureau of Kthnology. In addition to what is stated in this report, ref- 
erence should be made to the willing and efficient aid rendered by the 
curators of the Museum, who prepared a very instructive and impres- 
sive collection in a remarkably short time, notwithstanding the fact 



150 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

that the work was done in the hottest part of the summer. Prof. Otis 
T. Mason contributed a comprehensive ethnological collection, Mr. 
Thomas Wilson a synoptical series of objects, illustrating prehistoric 
anthropology, the remains of primitive mau in the new world and the 
old being shown side by side. Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, who was detailed 
for this work by the director of the Bureau of Ethnology, prepared a 
display of the arts and architectures of the Pueblo Indians of the south- 
west. Dr. Cyrus Adler selected from the treasures of the section oi 
Oriental Antiquities an exhibit of Biblical archaeology. 

The history of transportation by laud and water was happily and suc- 
cessfully shown by Mr. J. E.Watkins, who received most important aid 
from the Baltimore and Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad Companies, 
and a supplementary display of models of ships and boats was arranged 
by Oapt. J.W. Collins. Mr. S. R. Koehler, with great energy and en- 
thusiasm, brought together a most instructive collection, illustrating 
the history and methods of the graphic arts, supplementing the collec- 
tions already in the Museum by loans from his private collection and 
from those of his friends and correspondents. Mr. T. W. Smillie 
gathered a similar collection to illustrate the history aud present condi- 
tion of the art of photography. Mr. F. W. True, assisted by Mr. F. A. 
Lucas, prepared a collection showing the classification of mammals. 
Mr. W. T. Horuaday, by means of specimens and pictures, preached a 
sermon upon the extermination of the native animals of North America. 
Mr. Robert Ridgway exhibited an attractive collection of birds; Prof. 
C. V. Riley, aided by Mr. John B. Smith, prepared a collection showing 
the classification of North American insects. Dr. R. E. C. Stearns and 
Mr. Rathbun contributed a few cases from the departments of Mollusks 
and Marine Invertebrates. Mr. F. H. Knowltou prepared an exhibit 
from the botanical collections, and Mr. W. S. Yeates, under the super- 
vision of Professor Clarke, arranged a case of North American gems 
and precious stones. All of these contributions are, as I have said, 
somewhat fully described in Mr. Earll's report, and this passing refer- 
ence is made solely for the sake of making proper acknowledgment to 
those to whom the success of our work at Cincinnati is entirely due. 

Special reference should be made to the work of Mr. W. V. Cox, who 
in addition to his regular duties in the Museum, undertook the financial 
administration of the work and carried through without a single disal- 
lowance from the Treasury the complicated and perplexing expenditures 
of the exposition's service. This was a task of much difficulty owing to 
the loose wording of the Congressional act providing for the participa- 
tion ot the Government departments, and still more to the capricious and 
unprecedented decisions of the special auditor appointed by the Presi- 
dent to audit the exposition accounts. In this work Mr. W. W. Karr, 
who also rendered volunteer service, and Mr. W. H. Kimball, Mere ex- 
ceedingly faithful coadjutors. 

Mr. Cox was also charged with the preparation of a special display to 



&EPORT OK ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 1 5 1 

be sent to the Exposition at Marietta, Ohio, a report upon which, pre- 
pared by him, is hereto appended (Appendix 1>). 
In conclusion I submit a brief review of the financial history of the 

work. 

The entire appropriation for the Smithsonian Institution, National 
Museum, and U. S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries, for the Centen- 
nial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, as mentioned in 
the act of Congress authorizing the same, was $50,000. Of this amount 
the sum of $10,000, by agreement between the Secretary of the Smith- 
sonian Institution and the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, was set 
apart for the use of the Commission, leaving $10,000 to cover all ex- 
penditures of the Smithsonian and Museum for the purchase of new 
material to complete series as well as all charges for services, and for the 
transportation and subsistence of employes sent to Cincinnati and Mar- 
ietta for the preparation, installation, and maintenance of exhibit. 

The first step was the preparation of an estimate of probable expendi- 
tures, leaving a general contingent fund of about $4,000, which was set 
aside to be drawn upon when necessary. 

The act of Congress making the appropriation did not become a law 
until May 28, and the exposition was to be opened on the 4th of July. 
It therefore became necessary to make our selections and purchases 
with all possible haste. The Museum schedule rates were, however, 
taken advantage of when practicable. In cases where this could not 
be done, and where the amount involved was considerable, when the 
articles were such as are usually found in the market, competitive bids 
were obtained. The expense of this hurried work was proportionately 
great, and a considerable wasteof time and effort was inevitable. 

This extra exposition work crowded into the hot summer months 
made it necessary for the chief clerk and his assistants to be at their 
desks early and late, a demand which they cheerfully complied with, 
giving up their much needed vacations in order to keep up their regular 
and extra duties. ' 

Vouchers had to be prepared in quadruplicate, one copy for the 
Smithsonian files, one for the special auditor, one for the disbursing 
officer, and one for the Treasury Department. This involved much 
clerical work, as the number of original vouchers was over three hun- 
dred, making it necessary, in order to fulfill all requirements, to pre- 
pare a total of more than twelve hundred copies of vouchers. 

While the nature and amount of the disbursements could not be ex- 
actly determined in advance, it is gratifying to be able to report that a 
provisional schedule of classified expenditures, which was prepared in 
the beginning, was at least approximately correct, and would have been 
still more accurate but tor the postponement of the time of closing the 
Exposition. As it is, the contingent fund of $4,000 inure than covers 
all differences between estimated and actual expenditures. 

Although the Exposition was closed as long ago as November 8, ISSS, 



152 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 188!». 

our accounts only became ready for final settlement on April 15, 1889. 
This delay was in part due to the fact that the regular routine of for- 
warding, signing, and returning the vouchers for articles purchased in 
foreign countries, necessarily consumed much time. Delay has also 
been caused by the retention and questioning of many vouchers in the 
office of the special auditor of Cincinnati accounts at the Treasury De- 
partment, although in every case his objections have been finally with- 
drawn, and all vouchers have, after protracted delays, been approved 
by that official. These delays, which seemed to us quite unnecessary, 
caused us much annoyance, as many of those who had furnished mate- 
rials or labor, almost daily, either in person or by letter, urged upon us 
their need of funds and the great inconvenience they were compelled 
to undergo by the delays which were entirely beyond our control, but 
for which they were disposed to hold us responsible. 

The Auditor raised many trivial points, which necessitated the writing 
of numerous letters in answer to uncalled for questions. This, together 
with long waiting for replies, which were usually transmitted verbally 
by a clerk, has greatly impeded action. In view of this experience it is 
urged that, should Congress decide to have the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion and National Museum participate in future expositions, the law be so 
framed as to require the appointment of an auditing officer familiar with 
the demands of exhibition work, in order to prevent the unnecessary 
retardment of public business, and the consequent incurring of extra 
expense by the Government. 

If such a course be not adopted, responsibility of selecting and decid- 
ing upon exhibits should be understood to rest entirely with the repre- 
sentatives of the various departments, and the auditor's province lim- 
ited to the careful examination of accounts, which, of course, should be 
sufficiently detailed to prevent errors. Experience has proved that 
only by some similar division of responsibility can successful results be 
obtained. 

Another fruitful cause of delay in our work has been the payment of 
all the accounts by a disbursing officer stationed at Newport, Kentucky, 
instead of Washington, where, as is always the case, nine tenths of the 
bills are contracted. The paymaster drew checks upon the Cincinnati 
depository only, a method very unjust to employes and workmen, who 
were obliged to wait many days before receiving their checks, and then 
to lose something of their hard earned money by the refusal of the 
Treasury in Washington to honor the same. The only alternative for 
them was to present the checks to local banks, paying the usual dis- 
count rates.

APPENDIX A. 

REPORT UPON THE EXHIBIT OP THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, INCLUDING THE I . S. 
NATIONAL MUSEUM, AT THE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION OP THE OHIO VALLEY AM) CEN- 
TRAL STATES, HELD AT CINCINNATI, OHIO, IN 1888. 

By R. Edward Earll. 

1. HISTORY OF THE MOVEMENT. 

The series of industrial exhibitions which culminated in the recent 
Centennial Exposition at Cincinnati had their origin in the annual fairs 
of the Ohio Mechanics' Institute. These fairs, though limited in scope, 
and depending largely both for their exhibits and patronage on the im- 
mediate vicinity, were very successful. They were held regularly for 
about tweuty years prior to the war of the rebellion, but owing to the 
nearness of the city to hostile territory it became necessary to tempo- 
rarily abandon them during this period. When revived in 1868 it was 
decided to greatly enlarge their scope. The Mechanics' Institute invited 
the co-operation of both the Chamber of Commerce and the Board of 
Trade, the result being the Cincinnati Anuual Industrial Exposition, 
with a board of fifteen directors consisting of five representatives from 
each of the bodies named. The expositions, which from that date were 
held almost yearly, met with much encouragement, not only from the 
local population, but from residents of other portions of Ohio and of the 
adjoining States. This encouragement led to the erection of perma- 
nent buildings in the center of the city at a cost of more than a million 
dollars. 

As early as 1883 it was decided that the exposition for the centennial 
year (1888) should exceed any of those previously held, and that an 
attempt should be made to show the progress "of art, science, aud in- 
dustry'' in the States comprising the original Northwest Territory dur- 
ing the first century of their occupation by civilized man. This was 
in accord with the action taken at the semicentennial celebration of 
the settlement of Cincinnati in 1838, when a committee was appointed 
to see that "the one-hundredth anniversary of the settlement of Cin- 
cinnati, occurring in 1888, be properly celebrated." An organization 
was soon perfected and plans developed for holding "the Centennial 
Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States," including" the States 
of the Northwest Territory and those which border upon the Ohio and 
even farther to the south." After considerable discussion it was de- 
cided, in view of the central location of the permanent buildings, that 

154 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 155 

these should lie used as a nucleus, and that additional space be secured 
for the erection of other buddings. Application was made to the board 
of public affairs, which granted the use of Washington Park on the east, 
and ol certain streets bordering the Miami Canal on. the west. In this 
way floor space aggregating 400,000 square feet, with 142,500 additional 
feel of wall space, was secured in the heart of the city. To place the 
project on a sound financial basis a guaranty fund of $1,050,000 was 
raised among the citizens of Cincinnati. 

The movement was indorsed by the city councils of Cincinnati, Co\ - 
ington, and Newport, and by the Ohio State legislature, which author- 
ized the appointment of honorary commissioners, voted a small sum of 
money for State representation, and directed the governor, in behalf of 
the State, to invite " the assistance and co-operation of the Federal Gov- 
ernment, our sister States, and especially the Central States of West Vir- 
ginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Illinois, and Michi- 
gan, and that they be requested to appoint five honorary commissioners 
each to assist in the organization and carrying on of this Centennial Ex- 
position." These States passed formal resolutions of acceptance and 
appointed honorary commissioners, but, as a rule, little was attempted 
in the way of preparing State exhibits. 

Copies of the resolutions extending an invitation to the Federal Gov- 
ernment were sent to the President and to Congress; and after con- 
siderable delay the initiative was taken by the Appropriations Committee 
of the House of Representatives, the chairman of which addressed let- 
ters to the heads of the several Departments with a view to ascertaining 
what could be done, and the amount of money needed by each for mak- 
ing a suitable display. This correspondence resulted in the draughting 
of a bill by members of said committee, which, after slight, amendment, 
passed both Houses of Congress and received the President's signature. 
The bill as passed read as follows: 

A \ ACT making an appropriation to enable tlio several Executive Departments of the Government 
and the Bureau of Agriculture and the Smith.soniau Institution, including the National Museum 
and Commission of Fish ami Fisheries, to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Val 
ley ami Central States, to lie held at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth to October twenty seventh, 
eighteen hundred ami eighty-eight. 

Whereas the States which comprise the Northwest Territory and the adjaceul 
States will hold at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth to October twenty-seventh, 
eighteen hundred and eighty- eight, a centennial exposition commemorative of the 
organization of the Northwest Territory under the ordinance of seventeen hundred 
and eighty-seven, in which exposition all the States and Territories of the United 
Statesand theGeneralGoverninenl have been invited to participate, the object being 
in said exposition to I present a panorama of the nation's resources and present state of 

progressive development, hy an exhibition of the products of agriculture, of the 
various industries and line arts: also tint results of advancement made in the sciences; 
the whole illustrating the opportunities secured to and the possibilities winch wail 
upon the citizens of this Republic : and 

Whereas the citizens of the Ohio Valley and the several States adjacent thereto 
have made Bui table and adequate preparation and arrangements for holding said ex- 
position, and are desirous, and it being lit and proper, thai the several Executive 
Departments of the Government, the Department of Agriculture, the Smithsonian

Institution, including the National Museum and Commission of Fish and Fisheries, 
should participate in said exhibition: Therefore, 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled, That the head of each of the several Executive De-

may impose and prescribe. 

Approved May 28, 1888. 

Shortly after the passage of the above bill the President, in accord- 
ance with its requirements, designated one of the officials of the Treas- 
ury Department as special auditor. This gentleman at the outset 
questioned the right of the various Departments under the act to pur- 
chase any specimens for the completion of their exhibits, claiming that 
the collections must be made up of materials already on hand. This 
necessitated further action on the part of Congress which took the 
shape of a joint resolution declaring the meaning of the act. The reso- 
lution read as follows : 

JOINT RESOLUTION declaring the true intent and meaning of the act approved May twenty-eighth, 

eighteen hundred and eighty-eight. 

Resolved by the Senate and Bouse of Representatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, That it is the true intent and meaning of the act of Congress 
approved May twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, by the President of 
the United States, entitled "An act making appropriation to enable the several 
Executive Departments of the Government, and the Bureau of Agriculture, and the 
Smithsonian Institution, including the National Museum, and the Commission of Fish 
and Fisheries, to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Cen- 
tral States to be held at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth, to October twenty-seventh, 
eighteen hundred and eighty-eight," that the President of the United States may, in 
his discretion make an order directing that any documents, papers, maps, not origi- 
nal, books or other exhibits which properly and pertinently relate to the establish- 
ment of civil government in the territory northwest of the Ohio River, may be sent 
upon an Executive order from any of the several Departments in said act named, or 
from the exhibits now at Cincinnati; and that the appropriation of money in said 
act t<> defray the expenses of such exhibits, may be made applicable, in so far as the 
President of the United States may direct, to the payment of the expenses, of the care, 
transportation to, and return of, such exhibits from Marietta. And the same shall be 
paid from such fund heretofore set apart for each Department as the President may 
order. Nor shall anything in said act be bo construed as to prevent the purchase of 
suitable materials, and the employment of proper persons, to complete or modify 
series df object.-,, and classes of specimens, when in the judgment of the head of any 
Department, such purchase or employment or both is necessary in the proper prepara- 
tion and conduct of an exhibit. Nor to authorize the removal from their places of 
deposit in Washington of any original paper or documentor laws or ordinances what- 
ever. 

Approved, July It',. 1888. 

The original bill received the President's approval May 28th and on 
the following day in accordance with its requirements tli<> Secretary of 



158 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 188!). 

the Smithsonian Institution appointed Dr. G. Brown Goode the Assist- 
ant Secretary in charge of the U. S. National Museum, as its represent- 
ative. 

The item of $50,000, appropriated for the Smithsonian Institution in the 
bill, included the U. S. Fish Commission, and, by an agreement with the 
Commissioner of Fisheries, $10,000 was set apart lor the use of said Com- 
mission, leaving $40,000 to be expended under the direction of the Insti- 
tution. As little more than a month remained before the exposition was 
to open, it was impossible for the Smithsonian, or, in fact, for any of the 
Departments to prepare suitable exhibits, ship them to Cincinnati, and 
have them properly installed by the opening day. However, as no time 
was to be lost, a meeting of the representatives of the various Depart- 
ments was called with a view to the organization of a board, and the set- 
tlement of questions relating to the amount and location of the space 
to be assigned to each Department. At the first conference it was found 
that at leastl00,000 square feet of floor space would be required to accom- 
modate the exhibits which the several representatives proposed send- 
ing, but upon inquiry it was learned that the exposition officials, owing 
to the delay in the passage of the bill, and to the uncertainty as to the 
final action upon it, as well as to their lack of information concerning 
the amount of space required by the Government, had reserved only 
one short wing of the park building, aggregating about 13,000 square 
feet, for its use, the remainder having already been assigned to private 
exhibitors. As this amount was wholly inadequate, they at once con- 
sented to erect additional buildings in the park adjacent to, and com- 
municating with, the wing already reserved. But as the unoccupied 
space in the park was limited, it was impossible, notwithstanding their 
very generous disposition, to find room for new buildings of sufficient 
size to furnish the additional accommodations desired. It was finally 
decided to erect two annexes, one on either side of the Government 
wing of the main building, and in this way 29,000 feet additional were 
secured making a total of about 42,000 square feet available for the use 
of the Government. 

This space was divided approximately as follows : Fcet 

War Department 4,000 

Navy Department 4, 750 

State Department 750 

Treasury Department 4, 250 

Interior Department 6, 000 

Agricultural Department 4, 000 

Post-Office Department 2,500 

Department of Justice 750 

Smithsonian Institution 12, 000 

Commission of Fish and Fisheries 3, 000 

Total 42,000 • 

It will thus be seen that the space occupied by each Department 
was very much less than that desired, in some cases only a little 
more than one-third of the amount asked beiug assigned. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 1 59 

2. PREPARATION AND INSTALLATION OF THE SMITHSONIAN EXHIBIT. 

Immediately on his appointment Br. Goode commenced active op- 
erations. He soon outlined an exhibit which would require at least 
20,000 feet of floor space, and it was not until the work was well under 
way that it became known that only 12,000 feet could be secured. This 
necessitated considerable change in the plans, and it was finally decided 
to omit entirely certain subjects and to substitute pictures and models 
for the more bulky specimens in other groups, in order to bring the 
exhibit within the space assigned. 

In deciding upon the general character of the exhibit and the sub- 
jects to be represented, he was governed largely by the objects of the 
exposition as set forth in the preamble to the bill — viz : "To present a 
panorama of the nation's resources and present state of progressive 
development, by an exhibition of the products of agriculture, of the 
various industries and line arts; also the results of advancement made 
in the sciences; the whole illustrating the opportunities secured to and 
the possibilities which wait upon the citizens of this Republic." 

As the National Museum has an average attendance of about 300,000 
visitors yearly, it was necessary that its interests also should be consid- 
ered; and it was decided to interfere as little as possible with those 
departments, the exhibits of which were fairly complete and properly 
arranged, but in so far as might be practicable, to select the specimens 
for Cincinnati from the newer departments, and from the duplicate ma- 
terials, and to secure from other sources such additional articles as 
might be necessary to complete the exhibits, By this plan the educa- 
tional value of the Museum was largely preserved, and its most inter- 
esting series were left intact for comparison and study byits numerous 
visitors. 

Having outlined, in a general way, the plan of the exhibit, Dr. 
Goode called to his aid the curators of the several Museum depart- 
ments which were to be represented. These officials were charged with 
llic responsibility of preparing the necessary collections for their respect- 
ive departments ; and, as only four weeks remained before the opening 
of the exposition, they were obliged to neglect their regular museum 
duties and to devote their entire time and energies to the Cincinnati 
work. A large force of laborers and mechanics was at Qnce employed 
in packing such articles as were ready for shipment, and in mounting 
specimens, making models, cases, and other necessary art ides, while 
the curators busied themselves with the selection and arrangement of 
the available museum specimens, and in securing such new material as 
was required tor completing the collections under their charge. 

The first car-load of exhibits left on June 22, and others followed in 
rapid succession, so that by the 30th of the month eight of the twelve 
car-loads had been forwarded, all of the remainder, with the exception 
of the photographic exhibit, which was of necessity considerably delayed, 
leaving by the 12th of July. 



160 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

To save time, articles obtained from other parts of the country and 
from abroad, were sent direct to Cincinnati without coming to Wash- 
ington at all. 

Owing to the departure of Professor Laugley for Europe, in June, 
for an absence of some months, the duties of Acting Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution devolved upon Dr. Goode. This rendered it 
quite impossible for him to go to Cincinnati, and the writer was desig- 
nated deputy representative. He left Washington in company with 
Mr. James S. Morrill, who was to act as clerk, on the 2Gth of June, 
arriving in Cincinnati the following day. He was soon joined by a 
number of the Museum curators who came on to superintend the instal- 
lation of their respective exhibits. About the same time Mr. Heury 
Horan arrived with several skilled mechanics and laborers to assist 
in the general work. 

The space assigned to the Smithsonian was located in the northern 
annex to the park building near the Race street entrance. It consisted 
of a rectangular space 125 feet long by 95 feet wide, an uninterrupted 
wall space 13 feet high, extending along one entire side, this being 
practically continued around the remainder of the area by means of 
partitions which werebuiltto separate itfrom the adjoining departments. 
This gave a floor space of 11,875 square feet with about 6,000 additional 
feet of wall space, the latter being increased to over 10,000 feet by 
means of screens and partition, which it was found desirable to put up. 
After setting off a strip 17A feet wide through the center of the space 
in its longest direction for a main aisle or thoroughfare, the remainder 
was assigned to the sectional exhibits as follows : 

Square feet. 

Prehistoric Anthropology 600 

General Ethnology 1,120

The first four car loads of exhibits reached the exposition on the 28th 
of June, but, as the annex in which they were to be placed was not com- 
pleted, they were temporarily stored on adjoining space in the main 
building. Two days later the workmen completed the annex and the 
boxes were at once moved into it. Forty-five men, including the Wash- 
ington party, were soon at work unpacking and arranging the exhibits,

and while it was wholly impossible to have everything ready for the 
opening day an effort was made to have the installation as far advanced 
as possible, and by working early and late the work was rapidly ad- 
vanced, so that by 10.30 on the morning of July 4, when at the request 
of the Commissioners work was temporarily suspended, enough had 
been accomplished to give the visitor an idea of the character of the 
exhibit, and of what might be expected when finally completed. Equal 
activity prevailed in the other departments, and though none had their 
collections permanently installed, the progress made was very gratif'y- 
i ng. After the opening ceremonies were over, work was resumed, and as 
the articles arrived, they were rapidly put in place, but owing to soot 
which filled the air and settled upon the exhibits in such quantities as 
to seriously injure them, and also to the tendency of the visitors to 
handle the specimens, it became necessary to put many articles under 
glass, which otherwise would have remained uncovered. In this way 
the work of installation was somewhat prolonged, and it was more than 
four weeks before it was fully completed, though the public was ad- 
mitted to all of the Government departments during the progress of 
the work. 

The private exhibits in the various classes were as a rule in place on 
the opening day, and all of the available space was occupied. 

The Exposition, while in every way creditable to the management, did 
not receive that support from the public which its merits justified. The 
attendance during the first two months, possibly owing somewhat to 
the warm weather and the demands upon the time of the agricultural 
classes during the harvest season, was very light. However, as the 
weeks passed, it gradually improved, and during the months of Septem- 
ber and October was fairly satisfactory ; but the lack of cooperation 
on the partofthe railroads unquestionably had a marked influence on 
the attendance of people residing at a distance. Thinking that possibly 
the high price of admission had kept many away, it was decided to con- 
tinue the exposition for a few days beyond the 27th of October, which was 
the time set for closing, and to reduce the entrance fee to 25 cents, thus 
giving all classes the opportunity of seeing and studying the exhibits. 
But this did not result in any marked increase in the number of vis- 
itors, and when the doors were finally closed to the public* on November 
8, the turnstiles showed a total attendance of only 1,055,276, or an aver- 
age of 9,593 daily, as against a daily attendance of 55,06] at Philadel- 
phia in L876. It was, however, considerably in excess of the daily 
attendance at New Orleans in L885, which averaged (Sundays included) 
only 6,438. When it is remembered that Cincinnati is in the center of 
a very prosperous country, with a population of nearly five millions of 
people within easy access, the figures are certainly far below what 
might reasonably have been expected. Yet it should not be inferred 
that the Exposition was a failure, for the visitors as a rule appeared to 
be greatly interested, and the collections were studied with very great

162 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

care by various classes, notably by students from the institutions of 
learning in Ohio and adjoining States, and the educational influence 
upon these can not be overestimated. 

Governmental participation in the expositions of the past has usually 
been urged on the ground of the great educational value of such under- 
takings to the intelligent visitors. No one who has given the slightest 
thought to this subject or who has observed the crowds in their examina- 
tion of the collections, will for a moment deny this,nor will they fail to dis- 
cover that the exhibits of the General Government attract by far the most 
attention. If these departmental exhibits, when properly installed in 
Washington, were accessible to all, there would certainly be no excuse 
for ever sending them to other localities ; but as such a vast majority 
of the people of the country never visit the National Capital, the prac- 
tice of sending educational collections to the larger centers of population 
is perhaps justifiable. 

On November 8, the day set for closing, a party of eight arrived from 
Washington to assist in the work of packing the exhibits. It consisted 
of Mr. F. A. Lucas, who was to superintend the packing of the natural 
history collections, and Mr. Horan, who, with six skilled workmen, was 
to assist in the general work. A number of local mechanics and laborers 
were also employed and the work of packing was vigorously pushed. 
Five car-loads of exhibits were ready for shipment on the 20th of the 
month, and others were forwarded at intervals during the next two 
weeks, the last starting on December 4. They arrived with less than 
the usual amount of breakage, and by the middle of the following Feb- 
ruary, a very large percentage of them had been unpacked, repaired, and 
returned to their places in the Museum collections. 

In accordance with the provision of the law, the President on July 11, 
authorized the sending of an exhibit to Marietta, Ohio. Most of the 
material for this exhibit was sent direct from Washington, though a few 
articles were forwarded from the collections at Cincinnati. This collec- 
tion was under the direction of Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the Mu- 
seum, who has prepared a detailed report on the subject. 

3. REVIEW OF THE SMITHSONIAN EXHIBIT. 

The collective exhibit of the Smithsonian was, as already intimated, 
made up of separate collections prepared by the curators of several of the 
departments of the Museum. The general display may be divided into 
three groups, namely : Anthropological exhibits, natural history col- 
lections, and series belonging to the department of arts and indus- 
tries. A detailed description of the separate exhibits, or in fact, even 
a list of the objects exhibited, would extend this paper far beyond the 
proper limit. It, however, seems desirable to give a brief statement of 
the general character of the exhibits of the various sections. Such a 
.statement will be found in the following pages. When fuller infonna-

tioa is desired, it can be found in the reports of the curators, under 
whose direction the separate exhibits were prepared. 

SECTION OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 

Mr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of Prehistoric Anthropology, was re- 
quested to prepare au exhibit which should illustrate the methods em- 
ployed in the study of prehistoric man, and the present state of our 
knowledge of his manners and customs, and of his geographical distri- 
bution daring the different periods. To accomplish this purpose, he 
selected about two thousand specimens which would best represent man's 
progress during the early centuries of his existence. These included 
objects from all parts of the world. They were arranged in continuous 
series in cases placed end to end to represent the stream of time during 
the prehistoric ages. The entire series of cases was divided longitudi- 
nally, each separate division being devoted to a different country or group 
of countries. At the top was Great Britain, uext below came France 
and Belgium, then Italy, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries, Asia, 
Africa, Oceanica, and at the bottom the United States. Perpendicular 
divisions were also made to represent the various epochs of prehistoric 
civilization. By this arrangement it was easy to compare the progress 
of man in the different countries, and to show the variations in the im- 
plements used in each. Special attention was given to demonstrating 
that our own country was inhabited during the earliest periods. This 
was done by the exhibition of large series of specimens similar in all 
important particulars to those belonging to the earlier epochs from the 
Old World. 

The collection began with the Chellian epoch, when man used but 
one implement, a crudely chipped stone, and followed down through 
the different divisions of the stone age, then through the age of 
bronze to that of iron, showing clearly the steps in human progress from 
a lower to a higher civilization. Charts showing the distribution of pre 
historic man and the location of his settlements during different epochs 
were exhibited ; also drawings and models of the Swiss Lake dwellings; 
a skeleton of the cave bear ; and a series of crude stone, ivory, bone, and 
metal implements, used by Indians of modern times, to illustrate the 
various methods of fastening them to handles. 

SEC! ION "i ii UNOLOGY. 

The Curator of Ethnology, Prof. O. T. .Mason, was asked to prepare 
an exhibit to illustrate in a general way the leading characteristics of 
t lie different races of men ;. and to show the tribal relations of the North 
American Indians and the progress made by them in civilization. His 
exhibit occupied more than 1,1()() square feet of floor space, and ;it 
traeted much attention. It was divided into two series, namely: the 
general ethnological exhibit, which included all •>!' the principal races 
of men, and the collections illustrating the life and habits of the various 



164 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Indian tribes. The first series contained diagrams showing the classi- 
fication of mankind into races, and maps indicating, by colored areas, the 
distribution of the various races over the face of the earth. These were 
followed by models in plaster of the heads of many of the semi-civilized 
people of the Old World, and by full-sized figures showing the character- 
istic costumes of the various nationalities. 

The exhibit relating to the North American Indians was naturally 
more extensive. It included a large number of hand-colored photo- 
graphs showing both profile and front views of prominent members of 
each of the more important tribes. The life and habits of these Indians 
were illustrated by means of carefully selected collections of their im- 
plements, utensils and costumes. Among the specimens shown were 
war-clubs, bows, arrows, spears, tomahawks, seal ping-knives, cooking 
utensils, samples of weaving, dressed skins and agricultural implements. 
Collections illustrating the art, religion, and pastimes of the Indians 
were also exhibited. 

In the center of the space occupied by this department was a collec- 
tion showing the chemical composition of the human body. The series 
was based upon a man weighing 151 pounds, the exact quantity of each 
of the various solids, liquids, and gases being represented. On the 
opposite side of the same case were series showing the daily income and 
expenditure of the human body, and the amount of food required during 
a day of twenty-four hours by a man of moderate work, based upon the 
latest investigations by physiological chemists ; also a series showing 
the chemical constituents of a pound of wheat bread. 

Adjoining the general ethnological exhibit was a collection prepared 
by Mr. Walter Hough, to show the development of the lamp. It was 
not limited to the United States, but contained objects from various 
other countries as well. The series began with the fire-fly cage from the 
West Indies and the candle-fish of the Eskimo, and included the more 
interesting forms of torches, caudles, lanterns, and the various stone, 
metal, and glass lamps adapted to both animal and mineral oils and to 
electricity. 

EXHIBIT OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. 

In addition to rite exhibit made by the department of ethnology in 
the National M useum, already referred to, the Director of the Bureau of 
Ethnology, Maj. J. W. Powell, was requested to furnish a supplemental 
exhibit which should illustrate the methods employed by said Bureau 
in the study of the North American Indians. This exhibit, which was 
prepared by Mr. Cosmos M in deleft', related chiefly to the Pueblo In- 
dians and the mound-builders. It contained plaster models from life, 
by Theo. A. Mills, of six of the leading members of the Zuhi tribe. 
These were dressed in their characteristic costumes, including the orna- 
ments worn by them. In an adjoining case was a relief map of a sec 
lion of the ZuQi country showing the location of their settlements. 
Next came a series of scale models and photographs Qf many of their 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 165 

dwellings, both ancient and modern. Among these were some oi the 

most noted ruins as well as several of their most populous villages. 
The largesl model, which was about 15 feet square, represented the vil- 
lage of Znni on a scale of 1 to <!<>, all of the important details being 
carefully reproduced. The arts and industries of these people were 
represented by cases containing large collections of their textiles, bask- 
etry, pottery, agricultural implements, and household utensils. The 
mound builders were represented by several carefully prepared models 
of noted mounds from different parts of the country ; among these were 
the Great Elephant Mound of Grant County, Wisconsin, and the Large 
and Small Etowah Mounds of Bartow County, Georgia, with samples 
of pottery and other articles taken from them. 

EXHIBIT OF BIBLICAX AKCH^EOLOGY. 

Owing to the wide-spread interest in biblical studies, Dr. Cyrus Ad- 
ler, Assistant Curator of the Section of Oriental Antiquities, was called 
upon to prepare an exhibit which should enable Bible students (of 
whom it is estimated that there are already more than four millions 
in the Sunday-schools of the United States) to see something of the 
results of the work of the numerous specialists who have devoted their 
time and energies to the study of the people of Bible lands, and to be- 
come familiar with some of the interesting objects which have been col- 
lected and studied, with a view to the better understanding of the lan- 
guage, history, art, social life, and religion of these people. Nearly 
all of the most interesting objects secured by archaeologists are in for- 
eign museums, and the time was too short to have casts of them made 
and forwarded ; but by the co-operation of a number of people in this 
country who had articles in their possession, and by the liberal use of 
photography, it became possible to get together considerable material, 
which with the articles already in the possession of the Museum made 
a very instructive exhibit. The collection was not confined to the Is- 
raelites, but included all of the people with whom they came in contact. 
u Owing to the unparalleled conservatism of these people," says Dr. Ad- 
ler, " proper names, dialectic forms, architecture, costumes, and, what 
is more surprising, considering the changes of faith, even religious 
practices have persisted in the East through thousands of years." and 
the collections therefore properly included many objects still in use. 
The exhibits were arranged by countries, including Assyria and Baby- 
lonia, Egypt, Elam, and Palestine. They contained objects from a 
period beginning 3800 years B. < '.. and continuing to the presenl time, 
including royal seals and impressions of same, casts of obelisks and 
tablets containing pictorial aud historical inscriptions, photographs of 
the Egyptian pyramids, sphinxes, sculptures, mummies of noted kings, 
with specimens of plants, shells, lamps, and costumes collected in the 
several countries named. Among the more interesting objects were the 
casts of the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser II, the Rosetta Stone, the 
Moabite Stone, and the Siloam Inscription.

The Curator of the Department of Mammals, Mr. F. W. True, was 
asked to prepare an exhibit which should illustrate the principles on 
which the present classification of mammals was based. The family 
was selected as the division which would best represent the general 
theory of classification, and it was decided to send a collection which 
should include one or more characteristic specimens of every known 
family. As quite a number of the families were not represented in the 
museum collection it became necessary to secure specimens from other 
sources, and when such could not be obtained, to represent the family 
by means of pictures. Owing to the fact that classification rests partly 
on external and partly on internal characters, both skeletons and stuffed 
specimens were included. The families, excepting only a few of the larg- 
est forms, which from their size had to be separated from the systematic 
series, were arranged in zoological order in one continuous case 140 feet 
long, beginning with the highest order, man, and ending with the lowest 
or egg-laying mammals, thus affording excellent opportunities for study 
and comparison. The collection naturally included many animals with 
which the public had thus far had little opportunity for becoming ac- 
quainted. Among these were the gorilla, chimpanzee, aye-aye, panda, 
walrus, coney, tapir, saiga, antelope, almiqui, shrew, tana, chinchilla, 
coypu, whale, porpoise, manatee, aard-vark, pangolin, armadillo, ant- 
eater, duck-bill, and many other forms seldom found in expositions 
in this or any other country. 

MAMMAL EXTERMINATION SERIES. 

Adjoining the systematic mammal collection was a special exhibit pre- 
pared by Mr. W. T. Hornaday, Curator of Living Animals, to direct the 
attention of the public to the rapid destruction of many of the larger 
animals which are fast disappearing from the country, and are already 
in great dauger of extermination. The series included the bison, or 
American buffalo, moose, elk, antelope, mountain goat, mountain sheep, 
walrus, elephant-seal, and the beaver. The bison was the object of 
special attention, and a large series of pictures were shown to illustrate 
the numerous methods employed by both Indians and whites in its de- 
struction. In the center of the exhibit, upon a sod-covered pedestal, 
was a skeleton of a bison from which the hide had been removed, show- 
ing the condition in which the carcasses are left upon the plains by the 
hide-hunters; and on adjoining screens were specimens of the various 
grades of commercial hides, with a schedule of their past and present 
market values. There was also on exhibition a very instructive map of 
North America, showing by colored areas the original territory covered 
by the buffalo, and its narrowing range from time to time during the 
past quarter of a century, due to the destructive agency of man. In 
the rear of the exhibit was a case containing samples of the hides of

other animals which have been eagerly sought by the hide-hunter, and 
an exhibit of the different weapons used in the destruction of the va- 
rious species. 

SECTION OF niHPS. 

An instinctive exhibit of birds was prepared by the Curator of Birds, 
Mr. Robert Ridgway. It consisted of an extensive collection of finely 
mounted and carefully labeled specimens of the birds of North America, 
and of smaller series of the principal birds of foreign countries. 

The collection of North American birds was very complete, including 
examples of every known genus excepting onlya fewof the larger water 
birds and birds of prey, which were omitted for lack of space. They 
were arranged in proper sequence, thus affording an excellent oppor- 
tunity for the study of the latest scientific classification. In a few in- 
stances, where the birds were too rare and valuable to warrant the send- 
ing of specimens, they were represented by means of original water-color 
paintings by the curator. The collection of foreign birds, though much 
smaller, consisted of the characteristic types of various countries selected 
for the purpose of showing something of the bird fauna of the principal 
zoo-geographical regions of the earth. Among those represented were 
the Australian, Indo-Malayan, and Ethiopian regions, and the principal 
birds of Europe. Another series which attracted much attention from 
the exposition visitors was a collection of the principal birds of litera- 
ture, with the names by which they are known in poetry and appropriate 
quotations from the leading authors regarding them. A collection of 
birds' eggs and casts of same to represent the, various sizes, from the 
egg of the extinct epyorius or giant ostrich of Madagascar, with a ca- 
pacity of two gallons, to that of the humming-bird, and a set of fac- 
simile reproductions of the plates of Audubon's books on the birds of 
North America were also exhibited. 

SECTION OP INSECTS. 

This exhibit was prepared by Dr. 0. V. Riley and Mr. John B. Smith, 
it consisted of a systematic collection illustrating the various families 
of insects, and economic series showing separately the species injurious 
t<> agriculture and to forests. The systematic series represented, either 
by specimens or detailed drawings, all of the families of American in- 
sects. Where practicable, care was taken to select large and showy 
specimens to represent the different families, thus attracting the atten- 
tion of the public as well as that of the specialist to the exhibit. This 
was notably true in the case of the Ooleoptera and Lepidoptera, which 
contained many attractive forms. Each family was accompanied by a 
descriptive label calling attention to its peculiar characters, and in 
many instances was illustrated by several species. This series con- 
tained several thousand specimens, and was much admired both by the 



168 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

public and by students interested in this branch of natural history. 
The economic exhibit contained separate series, each being devoted to 
a particular species, including - insects that feed upon the different 
grains, the cotton plant, the apple, the grape, and the various species 
of ornamental and forest trees. It was prepared for the benefit of the 
agricultural classes, and contained specimens and drawings illustrating 
the development of the various species, their methods of feeding, and 
samples of roots, stalks, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits that had 
been injured by them. The descriptive label accompanying each speci- 
men contained information of practical value to the farmer and fruit- 
grower, and suggested methods by which they could to a greater or less 
degree protect their crops from the ravages of these pests. 

SECTION OF MOLLUSKS. 

The Department of Mollusks in the Museum forwarded a collection, 
prepared by Dr. W. H. Dall and Prof. R. E. C. Stearns. The object, 
as in the case of the other natural history collections, was to illustrate the 
principles on which the present system of classification was based. 
The exhibit, though occupying only about 250 feet of floor space, was 
very complete, and contained specimens representing all of the impor- 
tant families of marine mollusks not only of this country, but of other 
parts of the world. JSTo attempt was made to show the laud shells, as the 
time was too short to get up a collection, and there was not sufficient 
space for displaying the same, even if it had been prepared. 

SECTION OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 

A collection of marine invertebrates was prepared by Mr. F. A. Lucas, 
osteologist of the Museum. It consisted of a carefully selected series of 
typical representatives of the various families of sponges, corals, jelly- 
fishes, echinoderms, and star-fishes. As a rule, the species were repre- 
sented by dried and carefully mounted specimens of the animals them- 
selves ; but such groups as could not be preserved in this way were 
shown by means of glass models obtained from Europe. The collection 
of sponges contained full series of both the ornamental and commercial 
species of our own country and a number of the more important com- 
mercial species from the Mediterranean Sea. The families of corals 
were represented by numerous species from the offshore banks of the 
North Atlantic, by a number of the more attractive forms from the Gulf 
of Mexico, and by a collection of the typical forms from Polynesia. 
The growth of the red or precious coral of commerce was shown by 
means of models. The exhibit illustrating the families of jelly-fishes 
was made up exclusively of glass models, by means of which a number 
of the more delicate forms, including the Portuguese man-of-war, were 
represented. 

SECTION (IF BOTANY. 

The botanical exhibit was prepared by Mr. F. H. Knowlton, Assist- 
ant Curator of Botany. It consisted of a collection of chromolitho- 
graphs of the flowering plants and ferns of the country, and of an ex- 



REPORT OF assistant SECRETARY. 169 

hibit of specimens of marine algae. The series illustrating the flower- 
ing plants included about two hundred and fifty plates, each repre- 
senting a different species. It contained examples of all the princi- 
pal orders, the specimens selected being such as, on account of their 

beauty <>r curious form, would be most likely to attract the attention 
of the public. In many of these plates all of the parts of the plant, 
were represented, and in some instances the parts of the flower were 
enlarged to show the important characters of the species. 

The collection of terns was more complete. It contained eighty-one 
plates, on which one hundred and fifty, out of one hundred and sixty 
species of North American ferns were represented. These plates 
were taken largely from the published works of Eaton, Meehau, 
Sprague, and Groodale. 

The collection of algse included nearly all of the species known to 
occur on the Atlantic coast of the United States and manv of the 
common species from the Pacific. It was originally intended, in addi- 
tion to the above, to show separate collections of the flowers and 
ferns of the Ohio Valley, and also to prepare a comprehensive forestry 
exhibit, which should include sample woods and herbarium specimens 
of the principal trees of the Ohio Valley, photographs of the forest 
trees of the United States, and maps locating the present forest areas 
of the country: but the delay in the passage of the bill authorizing 
the exhibit and the lack of space made it impossible to do so. A 
collection of fossil plants to show the progress made in the study of 
paleontological botany was omitted for a similar reason. 

8ECTION OF MINERALOGY. 

This exhibit was prepared by Prof. F. W. Clarke, Honorary Curator of 
the Department of Minerals, with the aid of the Assistant Curator, Mr. 
W. S. Yeates. It was at first intended to send a complete collection of 
the minerals of North America, the floor space required being estimated 
at 1,200 square feet, and negotiations were begun for the purchase of a 
eollection, valued at $5,500, belonging to Mr. Joseph Willcox, of Phil- 
adelphia, which was especially rich in North American materials, to 
serve as a nucleus of the exhibit. The auditing officer for the Govern 
meat, however, objected to the proposed expenditure, and the plan of 
making a systematic exhibit was therefore of necessity abandoned. The 
exhibit as finally sent consisted of a single case, containing such gems 
and ornamental stones as were available from the collections already in 
possession of the Museum, with the addition of a small amount of gem 
material from other sources. It was limited almost exclusively to North 
American specimens. 

SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION. 

Some months prior to the passage of the exposition bill, Mr. J. E. 
Watkins, formerly with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, was ap- 
pointed curator of a newly-formed section of transportation in the Na- 



170 REPORT OF NATIOXA: MUSEUM, 1889. 

tional Museum, and considerable iuteresfc was already manifested by the 
public in the small collection which he had succeeded in getting together. 
He was requested to secure additional material to supplement this col- 
lection, and to send to Cincinnati a comprehensive exhibit which should 
illustrate so far as practicable, the development of the principal 
systems of transportation in the various countries of the world. 

He outlined a scheme based on the different motive powers, including 
man, the various animals, wind, steam, and electricity. In the division 
of steam transportation, special attention was given to the development 
of the railroad, and numerous models were secured illustrating the 
growth of the locomotive, the car, and the track, including rail, road- 
bed, and bridge. These were supplemented by a map, showing by de- 
cades the progress of railroad construction in the United States. The 
track exhibit was especially complete, containing scale models of nearly 
every style used in this country since the introduction of railroads, and 
also much interesting material from foreign lands. The collection con- 
tained many articles of historic interest, including models or drawings 
of many of the earliest locomotives and steam-boats, chief among which 
were Murdoch's high-pressure locomotive, 1784; Trevithick's locomotive, 
1804; Stevens's experimental locomotive, 1825; "Rocket" and "Stour- 
bridge Lion," both of 1829; Hull's steam-boat, 1739; Rumse.v's steam- 
boat, 1787; steamer "F. R. Stockton," 1839; also, the original papers, 
signed by Louis XYI of France in 1791, granting a patent to John Fitch 
for steam-boat propellers. 

The systematic exhibit already referred to was supplemented by an 
independent series showing the early methods of transportation in the 
original Northwest Territory. This collection, as was expected, proved 
of special interest to the exposition visitors, a majority of whom were 
residents of Ohio and adjoining States. It included a model of the 
" Sandusky," 1837 — the first locomotive in the State of Ohio, and of the 
" Orleans," 1812 — the first steam-boat on the Ohio River. 

While uumerous collections had previously been prepared to illus- 
trate the progress of one or another of the various systems of trans- 
portation, this was, so far as we know, the first attempt ever made to 
bring them all together, and to treat them systematically in one com- 
prehensive series. 

Much assistance was rendered by the Baltimore and Ohio, and Pennsyl- 
vania Railroad Companies, both of which furnished valuable collections 
showing the progress made on their respective lines; and by the officers 
of the Stevens Institute at Hoboken, N. J., who loaned various objects 
of historical interest and allowed photographs and models of others to 
be made. 

SECTION OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE. 

This exhibit was sent for the purpose of showing the various types 
of vessels of the world, especially those of North America. It was pre- 
pared by Capt, J. W. Collins, Curator of the Section of Naval Archi- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 171 

tecture, and was arranged in such a way as to direct attention to the 
improvements in vessels of modern times over those of earlier years. 
The exhibit consisted chiefly of rigged models, builders 1 models, and pict- 
ures. It contained many objects of historic interest which attracted much 
attention. The historical series began with the viking ship, dating back 
to 800 A. D., and included the famous Columbus fleet of 1492, the Car- 
rack of the Sixteenth century, the Spanish Galleon of the Sixteenth 
and Seventeenth centuries, the " Sally Constant" (the "Mayflower" of 
the Virginia Colony), the "Mayflower" of 1G20, and the " Cumberland", 
sunk at Hampton Roads during the late war. The other series contained 
models of the kyack or skin-boat of the Eskimo, the various types of 
fishing vessels of different periods, the principal kinds of merchant ves- 
sels and other sailing craft, and both river and ocean steamers of mod- 
ern pattern. 

SECTIOX OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

The photographic exhibit was prepared by Mr. T. W. Smillie, the 
photographer of the Xational Museum. The original plan was very 
comprehensive, the intention being to show, in so far as practicable, the 
origin and growth of the science, the various processes and appliances, 
the different uses of photography, and the literature of the subject; 
but the limited time remaining after the passage of the bill made it im- 
possible to fully carry out the scheme. The representation of origin 
and growth was therefore practically neglected, and the collection of 
appliances was of necessity somewhat limited, Mr. Smillie's attention 
being devoted chiefly to showing the more important processes and the 
various uses of the science. The collection of apparatus included por- 
trait and landscape cameras of former years, both single and stereo- 
scopic, a complete daguerreotyper's outfit, and a number of the more 
satisfactory portrait, enlarging, landscape, and detective cameras of the 
present day. The series of processes included the Daguerreotype, Tal- 
botype, albumen, collodion, and gelatine negative processes ; also series 
showing samples of plain, albumen, bromide, and other silver prints, as 
well as prints by the platinum, carbon, uranium, asphalt, and the nu- 
merous iron processes. Enlarged prints by the use of whey, platinum, 
and bromide, the collodion transparency, and transferotypes on paper, 
canvas, and porcelain were also exhibited. 

In addition to the ordinary uses to which photography is applied, at- 
tention was directed to its great value in other directions. One series 
of photographs illustrated its use, in connection with the microscope, in 
the study of disease germs, embryology, lithology, mineralogy, etc.; and 
another in connection with the telescope, in making astral charts, in 
studying eclipses, stellar spectra, and the like. Examples were also 
displayed showing its value for other purposes, such as the study of 
botany, zoology, architecture, Lamp flames, explosives, in the detection 
of criminals, in map and chart making, in recording the fluctuations in 



172 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, lss;t. 

various scientific instruments, as thermometers, barometors, and mag- 
net ic needles, in the study of special industries, in the illustration of 
of books, and as an aid to the artist and engraver. The literature of the 
science was represented by a series of photographs of the title-pages of 
more than three hundred books and pamphlets relating to photography. 
A small collection of photographs, forwarded by Mr. A. Howard Clark, 
curator of the section of personal and historical relics, was exhibited in 
this space. It consisted of a series of photographs of Washington and 
Grant relics in the possession of the Museum, and a collection of por- 
traits of men promiuent in the various branches of science during the 
past three centuries. 

SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS. 

This exhibit, prepared by Mr. S. E. Koehler, Curator of the Section of 
Graphic Arts, was intended to illustrate the various methods employed 
in the preparation of blocks and plates for pictorial printing. It was 
divided into four groups as follows : 

(1) The various processes of engraving and printing from the begin- 
ning of the Sixteenth century to the present time, exclusive of the mod- 
ern photo-mechanical processes ; (2) The history of wood-engraving in 
the United States; (3) The history of etching in the United States; 
(4) The modern photo-mechanical processes. The first group contained 
prints illustrating all of the most important processes of this division, 
twenty-four in number, and in the case of the principal ones an attempt 
was made to give, some idea of their history by the exhibition of care- 
fully selected series showing the progress made in several of the lead- 
ing countries including England, Germany, France, the Netherlands, 
and Italy, during different periods. 

As both wood-engraving and etch ing owe much of their present popu- 
larity to American artists either by nativity or adoption, and as the 
Exposition was largely for the purpose of showing the progress made 
in the arts and sciences, it was thought desirable to prepare extensive 
exhibits showing separately the growth of these processes in the United 
States. Considerable space was given to these collections in which 
specimens of the work of all prominent artists in either branch were 
displayed. The series of wood-engravings began with samples of the 
earliest work of Dr. Alexander Anderson, 1818, and included engrav- 
ings by no less than sixty different artists. The earliest etchings shown 
were those by Chapman in 1852, the bulk of the collection being made 
up of work executed within the past ten years. '• Special stress" says 
Mr. Koehler was » laid upon the painter etchings (i. e. original work), 
and the smaller reproductive plates made from about 1877 to about a 
year or two ago, while the large plates of a more commercial character 
which have appeared lately were represented only by a few selected 
specimens." In this collection over fifty of the leading etchers of the 
countiy were represented, thirteen of them being women. 

The fourth group was devoted to the modern photo-mechanical proc-

esses which are playing so important a part in the pictorial printing of 
the present time. Photography proper, being a photo-chemical process 
in which the print is made by the action of the sun's rays, was excluded, 
the exhibit being limited to those processes in which the printing-press 
is necessary to the manifolding of the picture, even though the block or 
plate may have been made wholly or in part by the chemical action of 
light. The various relief, photo-lithographic, zincographic, calographic, 
and intaglio processes were grouped separately, and an effort was made 
to show, by means of prints, the improvement made in each since its 
discovery ; though, as the processes are usually either wholly or in part 
secret, no attempt was made to illustrate the methods by which the 
blocks were produced. Mr. Koehler has prepared a detailed catalogue 
of the exhibit, in which the various processes are briefly described and 
much valuable information regarding their history is given. 

I. REVIEW <)F THE EXHIBITS OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE 

GOVERNMENT. 

State Department. — The State Department exhibit was under the di- 
rection of Mr. llaughwout Howe. It was prepared for the purpose of 
illustrating the work of that Department. It contained many papers 
and other objects of great historical interest. The series of diplomatic 
papers included the letter addressed by Benjamin Franklin to the pre- 
mier of France in December, 1770 (this being the first official communi- 
cation ever seut to a foreign court by an officer of our Government) and 
many other equally interesting papers, among which were letters bear 
ing the signature of many of the leading sovereigns of the world during 
the past century, and of almost every one now in power. The original 
treaty of 17X1* with Great Britain, which secured to us our independence, 
was exhibited, as were also a number of other treaties with Great Britain, 
France, The Netherlands, and Turkey, each bearing the seal of its 
respective government, and a whale's tooth sent asatreaty by the King 
of the Fiji Islands. There was also a complete series of portraits of 
the Presidents of the United States, ami another of the Secretaries of 
State from the time of Jefferson ; also photographs of the principal 
Government buildings of Washington, and of certain of our foreign 
offices, with maps showing the locution of our diplomatic and consular 
stations in all parts of the world. To the above were added many 
interesting historical relics from the library of the department, scries 
of medals awarded to the United States, to officers of the Army and 
Na\ ,\ . and to private citizens, and a full set of the department publica- 
tions, including I rnited States laws, diplomatic correspondence, foreign 
relations, consular reports, consular regulations, commercial relations, 
ami reports on various expositions. 

War Department. — The exhibits of this Department, prepared by 
Capt. II. A. Russell, Bureau of Ordnance, assisted i>\ Lieut. E. S. 
I lent on, Third Art i lien . were anion- the most interesting of I he Govern- 



174 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

merit exhibits. They occupied a floor space of about 4,000 square feet 
iu the eastern part of the south auuex adjoining the space occupied by 
the Navy Department. The collections were made up of materials 
obtained from different sources to show the various implements of war 
and the improvements in t v ;C same during recent years. The older forms 
consisted chiefly of war relics from different parts of the world, the 
greater part of them being objects captured from, or surrendered by the 
enemy during the wars with Great Britain, Mexico, the various In- 
dian wars, and the War of the Rebellion. These were supplemented by 
a large series showing many of the older styles of weapons used by our 
own army during the earlier years of its existence. The series of war 
relics contained a great variety of objects from all parts of the world, 
including spears, pikes, lances, bayonets, halberds, daggers, creeses, 
sabers, swords, scimeters, shields, armors, small-arms, and mounted 
and unmounted guns of various kinds. The collections showing the 
modern war implements were furnished in large part by the Bureau of 
Ordnance, and contained a sufficient number of primitive forms to show 
the origin and development of many of the implements of the present 
day. The series of small-arms began with the old match-lock, which 
was in turn followed by the wheel-lock, flint-lock, percussion -lock, and 
the breechdoading rifle. The series of larger guns contained mounted 
and unmounted specimens of various forms, including the muzzle- 
loading cannon, Napoleon gun, breech-loading steel field-piece, Gatliug 
gun, volley gun, Krupp gun, Hotchkiss gun, and numerous other forms. 
There was also a large series of projectiles of various styles, a collection 
of fuses, and samples of the uniforms worn by soldiers of different rank 
in the various branches of the Army. 

Navy Department. — The Naval exhibits, prepared under the direction 
of Lieut. Richard Rush, assisted by Ensigns E A. Clements and John 
Gibson, occupied about 4,750 square feet of floor-space fronting on the 
main aisle of the Government wing of the Park building, and extending 
backward for some distance into the south annex. They consisted of 
separate collections forwarded by the Bureau of Ordnance, Bureau of 
Construction and Repairs, Bureau of Navigation (including the Hydro- 
graphic Office, Office of Compasses and Naval Observatory), and by the 
U. S. Naval Academy. 

The exhibit of the Bureau of Ordnance consisted of steel breech-load- 
ing rifle guns of various sizes, Parrot rifle gun with fittings, howitzers, 
Gatling guns, small-arms of different patterns, specimens of projectiles 
and fuses, and a fully equipped torpedo-boat. The Bureau of Construc- 
tion and Repair sent a very valuable collection of models of our largest 
and most modern war vessels, including several now building. The 
Bureau of Navigation exhibited a complete set of day and night signals, 
and the flags of all nations. The Hydrographic Office forwarded a series 
of instruments used in its survey work, a portable observatory with the 
necessary equipment for the telegraphic determination of longitude, a 
collection illustrating the methods of chart construction from the first 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 175 

rough survey plottings to the completed chart, relief models in plaster 
showing the contour of the ocean-bed in various localities, and wind, 
current, thermal and other charts issued by this office as aids to navi- 
gation. The Office of Compasses sent a full set of mariner's compasses 
and other instruments for determining magnetism. The Naval Observa- 
tory exhibited a complete outfit of apparatus for astronomical work, pho- 
tographs of the heavenly bodies, and a set of instruments and electric 
apparatus to illustrate the operations of the Observatory time system, 
and to show its relation to the various commercial interests of the coun- 
try. Daring the continuance of the Exposition this department, through 
its Washington office, operated a time-ball by means of which the cor- 
rect time was furnished daily. 

Treasury Department. — The exhibits of this Department were made 
up of separate collections by several bureaus, including the Depart- 
ment proper, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Bureau of Print- 
ing and Engraving, and the Life-Saving Service. The collective ex- 
hibit, which occupied an area of 4,250 square feet at the farther end 
of the south annex, was under the general direction of Maj. Herman 
Kretz, representative, assisted by Lieut. C. H. McClellan of the Life- 
Saving Service, and Capt. C. O. Boutelle and Dr. J. H. Clark of the 
Coast and Geodetic Survey. 

The exhibit of the Treasury proper consisted of a complete collection 
of portraits in oil of the Secretaries of the Treasury from the organiza- 
tion of the Department. The exhibit of the Coast and Geodetic Survey 
was composed in large part of the scientific instruments and other 
apparatus used in its magnetic, hydrographic, geodetic, and topographic 
work, with a full set of the maps, charts, and publications of the sur- 
vey, and a set of standard weights and measures, and of the weights 
and measures of the metric system. 

The Bureau of Printing and Engraving sent an exhibit illustrating 
the various kinds of work done by its employes, including the different 
styles of engraving, and samples of printing by both hand and steam 
presses. The objects selected for showing the processes were United 
States bonds varying in size from $100 to $50,000, currency notes and 
silver and gold Certificates ranging from $1 to $10,000, internal rev- 
enue certificates and a collection of vignette portraits of two hundred 
of the leading American statesmen and inventors. 

The collections sent by the Lite-Saving Service consisted of a care- 
fully selected series, illustrating by means of pictures, apparatus, and 
models, the methods employed by it in the saving of botli life and prop- 
erty. It contained a complete station outfit, including self bailing 
life-boat and carriage, cannon, projectile, shot-line, life-car, breeches- 
buoy, and a complete set of lines, ropes, blocks, and signals; also a 
beach wagon fully equipped for service, samples of the life-jackets ami 
swimming-suits worn by the crew, ami statistic.il summaries of the 
work accomplished during the pasl lew years. 



17(1 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Department of the Interior. — The exhibits of this Department occupied 
the east front of the park building and the eastern side of the north 
annex. They were made up of separate collections from the Patent 
Office, General Laud Office, Census Office, Geological Survey, Bureau 
of Education, Indian Bureau, Bailroad Bureau, and Pension Office. 
The representative of this Department was the late Marcellus Gardner, 
who died after a brief illness while the exposition was still in progress, 
Prof. F. W. Clarke being designated as his successor. The bulk of the 
collections were sent by the Patent Office and the Geological Survey. 
The former sent upwards of two thousand five hundred models, which 
were arranged systematically by classes of inventions. Among the 
number were several of historic interest, including the original models

illustrating the different kinds of erosion, and a large collection of both 
plain and colored photographic transparencies of natural scenery indif- 
ferent parts of the country. The Laud Office exhibited maps and charts 
of the United States, and paintings in oil relating to gold, silver, and 
coal mining and to oil-wells. The Bureau of Education sent collections

kitchen and kindergarten methods. It also sent models of ancient im- 
plements, portraits of ex-Commissioners and prominent American and 
foreign educators, with statistics of schools and colleges. The Indian 
Bureau forwarded a collection illustrating the methods employed by it 
in the education of Indian children at the Government schools, with

by means of maps, the results of the Tenth Census of the United States; 
aud the Bailroad Bureau exhibited maps showing the development of 
our present railroad system, with photographs of the most noted rail- 
road bridges of the country. 

Department of Agriculture. — The exhibits of this Department occu- 
pied about 4,000 square feet of space fronting on the main aisle of the 
Government wing of the Park building, opposite the Post-Office exhibit, 
and extending back a short distance into the northern annex. They 
consisted of separate collections prepared by several bureaus of the De- 
pal tment under the general direction of Mr. William Saunders, repre- 
sentative. The Botanical Division sent about two hundred species of 
grasses, all carefully identified, with the locality from which they came, 
and other information regarding them. The Forestry Division exhib- 
ited sections of the wood of about one hundred of the commercially im*

portaut forest trees of the United States, with samples of their seeds. 
These were accompanied by maps showing- the location of forests, prai- 
ries and other treeless regions of the country, and the tanner's interest 
in forest property. The same division sent a series of photographs 
illustrating the effects of deforestation, another to show the methods 
adopted in France for restoring the forests, and a third to direct atten- 
tion to the results of tree planting in the city of Washington. The 
Pomological Division sent a series of colored drawings of the principal 
American and English fruits. The Mycological Division prepared a 
collection to show the various diseases of plants and the methods of 
treating them. The Ornithological Division sent a very interesting col- 
lection of the birds which are either directly or indirectly beneficial or 
injurious to agriculture, with a list of the various animals and plants 
upon which they feed. The Division of Animal Industries forwarded 
specimens illustrating the diseases of animals, their distribution, and 
the apparatus and methods employed in their study and treatment. 
The Chemical Division established a laboratory for practical work in 
agricultural chemistry, under the supervision of Mr. Gr. L. Spencer, who 
was in attendance at the Exposition to explain the details of the various 
methods. The Statistical Division sent several series of maps and 
charts to show, first, the distribution of the different food plants and 
other plants of economic interest; second, the area devoted to the cul- 
tivation of each, with statistics of production at different periods; third, 
the effect of price upon production; and fourth, the yearly export of 
agricultural products to different countries. 

Pout Office Department. — The exhibits of this Department occupied 
about 2,500 square feet in the east wing of the Park building at the end 
adjoining the central fountain. They were prepared under the direction 
of Maj. R. D. S. Tyler, representative of the Department. The main 
feature of the exhibit was a working post-office, complete in every par- 
ticular, which, through the cooperation of the postmaster at Cincin- 
nati, supplied the necessary mail facilities for the Exposition. Adjoin- 
ing this was an exhibit consisting of objects, models, and pictures 
illustrating the work of the several branches of the postal service. 
These included representations of the various methods of carrying the 
mails, such as the mounted carrier, sled, stage-coach, postal-car, and 
both river and ocean steamers, maps showing the post routes with the 
frequency of service and the location of the various offices, photographs 
of the principal post-office buildings of the United States and of several 
European countries, portraits of the leading post-office officials, copies

orders, historical series of stamping tools, mail-bags, letter-boxes, locks, 
and other articles. There was also an exhibit showing the work of the 
Dead-Letter Office, and, in addition, full statistics of the work of the 
Post-Office Department in its various branches. A very interesting 
addition to the exhibit was a machine for the manufacture of stamped 
envelopes, forwarded and operated by the owners. This machine au- 
tomatically gummed, stamped, folded, counted, and bunched envelopes 
at the rate of about 4,500 per hour. 

Department of Justice. — The exhibits of this Department occupied 
about 750 square feet of floor space to the right of the Department of 
State in the south annex. They were under the direction of Col. Cecil 
Clay, representative, who prepared several series of pictures to illus- 
trate the work of the Department. One of the features of the exhibit 
was a collection of large portraits in oil of all the Attorneys- General 
from the establishment of the Government. Another series of pictures 
showed the principal court buildings, with a list of the court officers in 
each judicial district, statistics of the work of the United States courts 
from 1883 to 1887, inclusive, and statistics of the legal business of the 
United States Supreme Court and the Court of Claims. A full set of 
the publications of the Department was also exhibited. 

The United States Fish Commission. — A very popular and instructive 
display was made by this Department under the direction of Capt. J. 
W. Collins and Dr. T. H. Bean. It occupied a space of about 3,000 
square feet at the extreme end of the north annex. The exhibit con- 
sisted of collections illustrating the methods employed by the Commis- 
sion in its scientific investigations, in its fish-cultural work, and in its 
study of the commercial fisheries. One of the most attractive features 
was a series of aquaria containing live fishes and other aquatic animals 
and plants. Among the fishes were many of the economic species of 
the Ohio River basin and a number of interesting forms from other 
parts of the country. The Division of Scientific Inquiry was repre- 
sented by photographs of its zoological stations, models of its vessels 
for exploration, and by samples of its apparatus for biological and phys- 
ical research, such as nets, dredges, sounding apparatus, thermometers, 
etc. It also exhibited a large series of marine animals from various 
localities and different depths. The Division of Fish-culture showed, 
by means of models, the method adopted by the Commission in taking 
the eggs from the parent fish for purposes of artificial propagation, and 
by apparatus supplied with live eggs of different species the methods 
employed in hatching them and in rearing the fry. This exhibit was 
supplemented by a complete fish-cultural outfit, including apparatus 
for collecting and transporting the eggs, hatching-troughs, boxes and 
jars suitable for developing eggs of the various species, models of cars 
and samples of tanks, cans, and pails used in the transportation of fry, 
rearing and feeding troughs, samples of fish-food, and models and pho-

tographs of the more important fish-cultural stations. The Division 
of Fisheries exhibited plaster casts of all of the principal food fishes, 
papier-mache* casts of the porpoises, the oil and bone whales, specimens 
of the edible mollusks of the country, and maps showing 1 the distribu- 
tion of the fishes of greatest commercial importance. It also sent pho- 
tographs of fishermen engaged in different branches of the sea and river 
fisheries, as well as pictures of their homes and villages, and, in addition, 
a series of pictures showing the various forms of fishing- vessels and 
boats, and the apparatus and methods employed in the cod, halibut, 
herring, mackerel, aud other fisheries, and statistical charts showing 
the yield in different years.

The Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum participated 
in the Centennial Exposition at Marietta, in conformity with the Pres- 
ident's order of July 11, 1888, which permitted the head of any Depart- 
ment to send such exhibits to Marietta, as, in his discretion, it was

ting the head of any Department to determine what, if any, of the exhibits from his 
Department should be sent to Marietta, pursuant to the provisions of the act, and to 
cause the removal of the same to Marietta, in charge of some careful and discreet 
person, if the appropriation allowed his Department is sufficient, and if in the discre- 
tion of the head of said Department such removal is proper and expedient. 

Grover Cleveland.

I Public Resolution No. 26.] 
Joint RESOLUTION declaring the true intent and meaning of the aot approved May 28, 1888. 

Resolvedby the Senate and Some of Representatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, That it is the true intent and meaning of the act of Congress ap- 
proved May "28, 1888, hy the President of the United States, entitled "An act making 
appropriation to enable the several Executive Departments <>f the Government, and 

the Bureau of Agriculture, and the Smithsonian Institution, including the National 
Museum and the Commission of Fish and Fisheries, to participate in the Centennial 
Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, to be held at Cincinnati, Ohio, 
from July 4 to October 7, 1888," that the President of the United States may, in his 
discretion, make an order directing that any documents, papers, maps, not original, 
books, or other exhibits which properly and pertinently relate to the establish- 
ment of civil government in the territory northwest of the Ohio River, may be sent 
it i >< > i i an Executive order from any of the several Departments in said act named, or 
from the exhibits now at Cincinnati; and that the appropriation of money in said 
act to defray the expenses of such exhibits may be made applicable, in so far as the 
President of the United States may direct, to the payment of the expenses of the care 
and transportation to and return of such exhibits from Marietta ; and the same shall 
be paid from such fund heretofore set apart for each Department, as the President 
may order. Xor shall anything in this act be so construed as to prevent the purchase 
of suitable materials and the employment of proper persons to complete or modify 
series of objects and classes of specimens, when, in the judgment of the head of any 
Department, sm-li purchase or employment, or both, is necessary in the proper prep- 
aration and conduct of an exhibit. Nor to authorize the removal from their places 
of deposit in Washington of any original paper or document, or laws or ordinances 
whatever. 
Approved, July 16, 1888. 

O wing to the absence in Europe of Professor Langley, the secretary 
of the Smithsonian Institution, Mr. G. Brown Goode, the acting secre- 
tary and representative to the Exposition,- was unable to leave his 
official post in Washington. T was therefore delegated to represent 
Professor Goode at the Marietta Centennial Exposition. 

The executive order permitting the sending of exhibits to Marietta 
was not received until noon of July 14, the day before the opening of 
the Centennial, and at 9.40 p. m. of that day, I, together with Mr. Paul 
Brocket t, took the first express train at Washington, with thirty-one 
boxes, containing 7,327 pounds of exhibits in charge. 

Arriving about noon of the 15th, these exhibits were conveyed to 
the City Hall, and by 2.30 a. m. the following day, the centennial 
anniversary of the inauguration at Marietta of General St. Clair as 
the governor of the "Northwest Territory," the display of the Smith- 
sonian Institution and the National Museum was in order and ready 
lor examination. 

It was thought that students of Marietta and the archaeologists would 
be interested in a collection illustrative of the arts of the Haida Indians 
of Queen Charlotte Archipelago, British America, as these Indians are 
in the same condition of culture as the builders of the earthworks at 

Marietta, and so, to give, a general idea, of the .arts of the ancient mound-

cal elements and compounds of the body, so far as possible to science 
to obtain or represent them. This exhibit, which is explained by the 
accompanying list of objects shown, and by copies of the large descrip- 
tive labels, attracted perhaps more attention than any other sent by 
the Museum, curious and interested crowds being seen at all times ex- 
amining it. 

In addition to the collections from Washington, Mr. J. E. Watkins, 
Curator of the Department of Transportation in the National Museum, 
who was in attendance at the Cincinnati Exposition, was telegraphed 
to bring from his department at that Exposition such models, engrav- 
ings, and paintings as could be spared, illustrative of the methods of 
transportation adopted by the early settlers in America, and of the 
early navigation of the Ohio River, together with the means of reach- 
ing the Ohio Valley from the sea-board, from aboriginal times to the 
introduction of the locomotive. 

This exhibit, which was placed in the center of the hall aud directly 
in front of the entrance, proved very attractive, so much so, in fact, 
that it was found necessary to protect it with a railing from eager but 
not unfriendly hands, that frequently took the birch-bark canoe on im- 
promptu journeys around the room, and sometimes tried to set the ma- 
chinery to work in the models of the antiquated steam-boats on exhibi- 
tion. 

The transportation exhibit may be briefly described as follows : 

(1) Type of birch-bark canoe used on the Ohio River by the Indians. 

(2) Engraving of ship Sally Constant, which brought the first settlers 
in Virginia to Jamestown, among whom were many of the ancestors 
of the pioneers of the "Northwest Territory." 

(3) Boat similar in construction to that built by Captain Devoll in 
1787, and known as the Mayflower of the Ohio. Captain Devoll having 
been a constructor of whaling ships in Massachusetts, the lines of the 
hull are similar to boats of that time constructed in the east. 

(4) The Orleans, 1S12, the first steam-boat on the Ohio River; con- 
structed in 1 SI 1 at Pittsburgh. Pulton and Livingstone, having met 
with success in introducing the steam-boat on the Hudson, four years 
later transferred their sphere of labor to the western waters. This boal 
was on her way to New Orleans during the earthquake of L812, and, 
reaching there safely, continued to run between that point and Natchez 
until July 14, 1814, when she was sunk off Baton Rouge. Her ma- 
chinery, however, was saved, and with a new boiler was transferred to 
another boat, whieli was called the \(ir Orleans. 

The Baltimore and Ohio Railway in 18l'.S began to lay its tracks from 
Baltimore toward the Ohio River. The steam locomotive at that time 
was not in successful operation, and many experiments were made in 
the construction of cars and in the application of power. Models illus- 
trating these experiments were also shown. 

(5) Closed passenger-car with weather-boarded sides, and windows 
Similar to those in dwelling houses; built to be drawn l»s horses. 



18f) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 188C 

((j) Double-deck, stage-body car, also to be drawn by horses. 

(7) Horse-power tread-mill car. This car was driven at the rate of 12 
miles per hour by a single horse in the tread-mill, which was geared to 
the wheels by a band. 

(8) Sail-car, with which experiments were made with a view to utilize 
the power of the wind, as in boats. 

(9) First car drawn by a locomotive on the Baltimore and Ohio Kail- 
way. 

(10) Engraving of first train of cars drawn by a locomotive in the 
State of New York, on the line of communication between Boston and 
New York. 

(11) Engraving of the first passenger-car on the Camden and Amboy 
Railway; used on the route from New York to Philadelphia. 

(12) Model of canal packet-boat; used on the Pennsylvania Canal on 
the through route from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. 

(13) Model of canoe used by the Haida Indians. 

(14) Indian of the Northwest returning from the hunt with a bunch 
of ptarmigan. The full-sized figure illustrates the manner in which 
snow-shoes are used to aid individual movement. 

In the Exposition Hall, besides the exhibits sent by the Smithsonian 
Institution and the National Museum, was the interesting display of 
the State Department. This embraced copies of the most important 
treaties made by the United States, a fae- simile of the Declaration of 
Independence, photographs of several historical pictures of much in- 
terest, and pictures of most of the Presidents of the United States. 

The U. S. Geological Survey had an attractive exhibit of photographs 
and transparencies, one of the finest of the latter being a view of the 
Grand Canon of Colorado, looking west. The photographs of dwellings 
in the Zuni villages, showing the mode of entrance to the houses, and 
giving an accurate idea of many features in the life of a people just now 
the object of so much interesting research, attracted the attention of 
ethnologists and others. 

In the armory building of Marietta the local display proper was to 
be seen. Here one could find relics of the mound-builders and of the 
Indian tribes who disappeared at the coming of the white man. Then 
there were precious heirlooms of the first families of the Northwest ter- 
ritory, in the shape of antique furniture, clocks, books, deeds, pictures, 
needlework, old china, silver, pewter, spinning-wheels, and watches. 

There were Washington relics, there were La Fayette relics, there 
were many articles that had belonged to General Israel Putnam, and 
to his grandson, the Israel Putnam who was one of the pioneers of Ohio, 
and there were relics of many other of Ohio's most distinguished chil- 
dren, civil and military ; there were also many articles that had been 
the property of Burr and of Blenuerhassett. The historian and the 
relic hunter alike were attracted by this remarkable collection.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF JAMES STEVENSON. 

James Stevenson was born in Maysville, Ky., December 24, 1840. 
His father, who settled in Kentucky early in the century, was a Vir- 
ginian, and, it is believed, probably of that hardy Scotch-Irish family 
of Indian fighters and riflemen to which belonged Col. Hugh Steven- 
son, of the Berkeley Riflemen, and his brothers, Col. Richard and 
Col. Valentine Stevenson, all soldiers of the Revolution. He was 
a vigorous, active boy, and at an early period showed an enthusiasm 
to explore the Rocky Mountain region and to see the Indian in his 
home. He read all the books of travel and adventure he could borrow, 
and at the age of thirteen he ran away from home and joined a party 
of the Hudson Bay Fur Company's traders, bound up the Missouri 
River. Dr. F. V. Hayden was a passenger on the same packet, on his 
way to explore the fossiliferous regions of the Upper Missouri and Yel- 
lowstone. He noticed that Stevenson had taste for natural history, 
and invited him to join him in his work. 

The boy showed tireless energy in collecting objects of natural his- 
tory and ethnology along the buttes, mesas, and river benches of the 
Mitu raises Torres, ami in time became an explorer of intrepid courage 
and indefatigable zeal. 

He remained in the region of the Upper Missouri and the Yellowstone 
month for three years, and became acquainted with the Crows, Black- 
feet, Gros Ventres, and other Indians, up to that time little changed by 
intercourse with white men, and acquired a knowledge of their customs 
and characteristics. 

In 1857 the Pacific Railroad surveys of the Government having been 

fairly begun, Stevenson, still an assistant of Professor Hayden, was 

attached to Lieut. G. K. Warren's party, and subsequently to that of 

Lieut. F. W. Reynolds. At this time he made a useful collection of 
fos.sil mammals and reptiles, and another illustrating the zoology and 

botany of the " Bad Lands." The labor and exposure incident to ex- 
ploration at that time can not be properly appreciated in these days 
of rapid and luxurious travel. 

In 1861 James Stevenson enlisted as a private soldier in the Thir- 
teenth Regiment, New York Volunteers, and remained iu the service 
until 1865. He took part in all the heavy battles of the Army of the 

1-7 



188 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Potomac and won an officer's commission. After the war he again 
joined Professor Hayden in his exploration of the Upper Missouri, 
under the auspices of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. 

Soon after the return of peace, the Pacific Eailroad project was taken 
up by Congress. Among the Western members of the House who be- 
came its advocates was General John A. Logan, who took the lead in 
combating the statement that the Territories had no coal. He main- 
tained that coal existed in abundance, and that it could be located by a 
proper geological survey of the region. Stevenson was his principal 
authority for his statements, and urged upon him the necessity for such 
surveying works. After consultation with Professor Baird, General 
Logan, in the winter of 18G7, proposed an amendment to the sundry 
civil bill authorizing the organization of a geological survey under the 
direction of Professor Hayden, and by a vigorous effort secured its 
passage. 

The legislation of 1867 was the beginning of the geological and geo- 
graphical survey of the Territories. Stevenson was made the executive 
officer of the new organization, and retained this position during its 
entire existence. 

His tastes were rather toward ethnology than geology, and his win- 
ters among the Blackfoot and Sioux Indians were occupied in part in 
studying their customs and their dialects. 

From 1808 to 1878 he took part in all the adventures of the Hayden 
survey; with it he explored almost all of the Territories, and had a 
share in bringing to light the hidden marvels of Yellowstone Park, and 
in urging its retention as a public reservation. He followed the great 
rivers of the continent to their sources, and discovered a new path 
across the Rocky Mountains. He ascended the Great Teton, and veri- 
fied an Indian tradition of the presence of a stone altar upon its top. 

His frontier experience fitted him for understanding thoroughly the 
requirements of explorers in the field. He was a good judge of char- 
acter and showed much tact in planning and expediting the operations 
of the mixed trains engaged in the survey work. He led working par- 
ties of experts trained in topography, geology, and natural history over 
the unexplored regions of Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Montana, 
Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Dakota.* 

When the various geological and geographical surveys were consol- 
idated in 1879, Mr. Stevenson became associated with the operations 
of the Bureau of Ethnology, under Major Powell, and continued his 
investigations of the 1 udians. When Clarence King resigned the direct- 
orship of the new geological survey and Major Powell was selected to 
succeed him, Mr. Stevenson was appointed the executive officer of the 
latter organization. In this new trust the had charge of outfitting and 



* His work was chiefly in the following regions: 1851-'53, Upper Missouri. 1859- 
'60, Wyoming and Montana (thin Nebraska), with Reynolds. 1866, Bad Lands in 
Dakota, with Hayden. 1867, Nebraska, with Hayden. L868, Wyoming, -with Hay-

supplying its parties in the field and of its business operations in (lie 
Bast. His relations with the members of both Houses of Congress, dur- 
ing the many years he appeared before that body in the interests of the 
U. S. Geological Survey and other scientific organizations, were always 
pleasant, and the members of Congress, of both parties, had faith in 
his integrity. Senator Edmunds once declared ou the floor of the 
Senate, when some Senator proposed a reduction in the salaries of the 
director and executive officer of the Geological Survey, that Mr. Steven- 
son was "one of the best workers in the world." 

In 187!) he began the exploration of the prehistoric cliff and cave 
dwellings of Arizona and New Mexico, unearthing an extended series 
of buried ruins and making a large invaluable collection of ancient 
pottery, costumes, weapons, and ceremonial and industrial utensils, 
now in the National Museum. He made a study of the religious prac- 
tices of the Zuni tribe of Indians and the history and folk lore of the 
Navajos and the Moquis. In this latter work he had a faithful assist 
ant in Mrs. Stevenson, who made an especial study of the domestic 
and religious side of the Indian character. It was a source of regret 
to Mr. Stevenson that his duties with the Survey prevented him from 
completely publishing the investigation he had planned, and it remains 
for his widow to complete for publication the results of the work which 
they began together. 

In 1886, while exploring some of the highest mesas of Arizona and 
New Mexico, he was attacked by that singular disease of those regions 
known as"mouutain fever," from which he partially recovered after 
his return to the East. In spite of the remonstrances of his friends he 
spent the season of 1887 among the ruins iu the Tewan Mountains of 
New Mexico and at the pueblo of Sia, where he found a rich field for 
study. He discovered that the Sia, like the Moki, hold ceremonials 
with the rattlesnake (a secret most jealously guarded by these Indians), 
and he succeeded in obtaining one of the ancient vases in which the 
snakes are each year gathered. His collection of idols and fetishes 
from Sia is the rarest yet obtained from any pueblo. 

When he came East in November he was suffering from valvular 
heart trouble, and, after a brave fight for life, died in New York City 
July IT), 1888. 

The full story of his useful life would fill a book. His resources 
when leading a party through a wild district were limitless, and he was 
always ready to meet, by quick action and apt understanding, any acci- 
dent or miscarriage in the field. One of his associates tells the follow- 
ing incident, which illustrates the readiness of his faculties:

190 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

In July, 1871, the Hayden survey reached the shores of the Yellowstone Lake, and 
as it came into camp for the first time on its banks, the beautiful sheet of water 
courted navigation. No provision whatever had been made for building a boat — the 
thought had not entered the minds of Dr. Hayden or Mr. Stevenson when they out- 
fitted for the exploration, and nothing therefore was taken into the luggage of the 
party and its pack-train for such a contingency. As the members of the party gazed 
with delighted eyes upon the broad expanse of this big mountain lake, a general 
desire to sail out to the islands upon its waters was loudly expressed, coupled with 
regret that no fit means for so doing was available, rafting being wholly inadequate. 
Stevenson said nothing, but quietly took the cook's axe, called two of the packers 
and went with them into a thicket of young birch and spruce trees, where he speed- 
ily trimmed out the ribs and gunwales of a double-ended and skiff-shaped boat. He 
lashed these into place and then took one of the cargo covers — a large square sheet 
of heavy canvas — with which he neatly covered this rude frame. A small mast was 
stepped, and a pair of oars adjusted as they were hewn out, together with a large 
steering sweep. He began this work about 2 o'clock in the afternoon ; just before 
nightfall or dark (about 9 o'clock then and at that place) the little boat, some 13 feet 
in length, was launched, and Mr. Stevenson pushed out from the shore for a brief 
trial trip. The boat was a perfect success, and by its aid a complete hydrographic 
survey was made before the party left that region. 

In ways like this he overcame the many unforeseen obstacles which 
arise in the path of a scientific exploring party. Climbing mountains, 
winding through forests and caiious, crossing ugly, treacherous streams 
and arid plains, in heat or in cold, in rain or in sunshine, or meeting 
hostile savages, Mr. Stevenson was always in the front, always ready, 
and always geuial, aud always the quiet and resolute master of the sit- 
uation. 

Three descriptive and illustrated catalogues of archaeological and 
pueblo collections were prepared by Mr. Stevenson and were published 
by the Bureau of Ethnology. He also prepared for publication papers 
relating to the myths, ceremonials, and sand paintings of the Navajo 
Indians, and to the archaeological remains of the southwest. 

The death of James Stevenson was a positive loss to the institutions 
to which he devoted his life, viz, the U. S. Geological Survey, National 
Museum, and Bureau of Ethnology, and to scientific explorations. No 
offers however flattering could allure him from his life's work. He 
labored from a love for truth, aud was ever ready to lend his aid to 
any movement for the advancement of science. His modesty and un- 
selfishness won for him the esteem of all who knew him.

REPORTS OF THE CURATORS OF THE U, S. NATIONAL MUSE1 \l 
UPON THE PROGRESS OF WORK DURING THE FISCAL

•2711 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOUY 
IN THE U. S, NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889, 



]*y <>tis T. Mason, Curator. 



Among the collections secured during the year, the following are 
worthy of especial mention : 

Dr. Washington Matthews's type set of Navajo blankets upon which 
his paper published in the third annual report of the Bureau of Eth- 
nology is based. 

A small lot of specimens from the Klyoquot Indians well authenti- 
cated by James G. Swan, to be used in labeling older objects from the 
same locality. 

Antiquities and sketches from Egypt, by Dr. James Grant Bey, of 
Cairo, Egypt, accompanied by letter giving full information. 

The entire contents of an Indian grave, presumably Choctaw, by 
Dr. W. A. YVhitten, Moline, Mississippi, to be exhibited as a polyor- 
ganic museum unit. 

A valuable series of religious objects from Thibet, collected by Mr. 
W. W. Rockhill. Each specimen was secured by Mr. Rockbill himself 
and is well authenticated. 

A lot of objects from Mr. Edward Lovett, in England, especially use- 
ful in the illustration of the first steps in our modern inventions. 

Mr. James Moouey, having spent two summers among the Cherokees, 
in western North Carolina, studying their dances and ceremonies, eon- 
tributes excellent series of dance paraphernalia, with lull information. 

From Mrs. Col. James Stevenson the Museum has secured some rare 
pieces of old Pueblo pottery, and her own private collection of Zuni 
arts, with detailed instructions for labeling and mounting. 

Col. J. I. Allen, of Stillwater, Montana, has sent a rare collection 
from that almost inaccessible region. 

Special mention is made of these accessions, because they fulfill the 
requirement of the curator with regard to accurate information. 

During the year new sections have been organized in the exhibition 
series. In order to interest a large number of scholars not hitherto 
specially attached to the institution, efforts were made to gather in the 
National Museum facsimiles of all the inscriptions, seals, etc., in the 
country, relating to what is called in England" Biblical Arch geology," or 

• i 



282 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSKUM, 1SS9. 

the study of countries lying within an SOO-iniic radius around Palestine. 
So rapidly has this plan developed that a new section was formed under 
the curatorship of Dr. Paul Haupt, with Dr. Cyrus Adler, as assistant 
curator. Both of these gentlemen are connected witli the Johns Hop- 
kins University, Baltimore. A report of this section will be made by 
Dr. Adler. 

Another exhibit organized may be called the ethnic series. In it 
by means of charts, colored maps, life-size lay figures, busts, miniature 
lay figures, painted portraits, and colored photographs, it is designed 
to teach the visitor the spread of various types of mankind, and to show 
just how these types appear. Great care has been bestowed upon this 
section. From Paris have come M. Hebert's reproductions. Many 
pieces have been prepared by our own workmen. The Bureau of Eth- 
nology contributes photographs of all Indian delegations visiting the 
city. The Austrian minister has given a set of maps. This series is so 
installed that a public-school teacher may bring her class to the Museum 
and give to them a practical lesson in ethnology. 

In another section of ethnic installation the curator is enabled to ex- 
press his renewed obligation to the U. S. Navy. In a former report men- 
tion was made of the great help rendered by Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, U. S. 
Navy, in the installation of the Eskimo collections. During the last 
year the curator was aided by Ensign Albert P. Niblack, U. S. Navy, 
in arranging the specimens from the strip of our continent lying be- 
tween Mt. St. Elias and Vancouver Island, along the Pacific coast, 
partly in British Columbia and partly in Alaska. This region is 
sometimes called the Northwest coast of America. The only objection 
to this title is the fact that in the Wilkes' narrative the same term is 
applied to the strip from San Francisco Bay to the Straits of San 
Juan de Fuca. There are several distinct linguistic stocks here, the 
Koloshan, the H aid an, Tsimsian, Haeltzukan,.and Salishan, but the 
region forms one of these unique areas in which the arts, the modes 
of life, even the philosophical and religious conceptions have been 
-mded and molded by surroundings. 

Ensign Niblack was on duty in the Museum from October 3 to 
March 22. He was ordered to the Smithsonian to prepare a report on 
the Coast Indians of Alaska and Northern British Columbia from 
notes made in connection with the survey ot Alaska in 1885, 1886, and 
1^87, such orders being in pursuance of a plan formed by the Navy 
Department iu 1881, to further the progress of scientific research by 
enlisting the interest of naval officers on their cruises iu making such 
collections and notes as might prove of value. The ethnological ma- 
terial in the National Museum from southern Alaska offered a fine 
field for illustrating the ethnographic character of these Indians, 
and in connection with the photographs and sketches taken in the 
field, form the basis of the illustrations of the report. Two charts also 
accompany the report, one representing the Indian stocks, as defined 



DEPARTMENT OP ETHNOLOGY. 283 

by the most recent investigations io British Columbia, and the other 
the location of the different tribes of the Koloshan and Baidan .stocks 
about Dixon Entrance, which arm of the sea forms the natural 
boundary between Alaska and British Columbia. In connection with 
this latter chart it may be well to state that it outlines the hunting 
and fishing grounds of the different tribes as far as obtainable by the 
writer. The report itself does not deal with the linguistic character- 
istics, the religious beliefs, or superstitions and traditions of the 
Indians. Otherwise it aims at a somewhat systematic general ex 
position of the habits, customs, arts, industries, and characters of the 
Indians composing the Koloshan, Baidan and Tsimshian stocks and 
in connection with the accompanying illustrations will serve as a de- 
scriptive catalogue of the collection in the National Museum from this 
region. In the selection of the material lor illustrations from the 
Museum collections, characteristic specimens were formed into an 
ethnographic collection illustrative of these Indian stocks, similar to 
the Eskimo collection now so graphically arranged in the Museum. 
General descriptive cards were written to temporarily explain the 
significance of the collections until such time as the individual cards 
may be prepared from the report. From the narrative of early voy- 
ages the primitive customs and characteristics of these natives are 
contrasted with those of the different periods in the past century. 
Much new material is presented, notably the illustrations of ancient 
wooden and leather armor, the preparation of tobacco, details of 
house and canoe construction, several methods of hunting and fish- 
ing, the significance of totemism, the steps in the development of the 
arts of painting and carving and outline of their principal ceremonial 
institutions. This report will undoubtedly form the basis of any 
further ethnological research in that region, and the section will bean 
object lesson to explain the report. 

Another scries of objects arranged for public inspection in the Museum 
is designed to teach the history and elaboration of a single group of 
industries, namely, those connected with the protection and manipula- 
tion of tiie. Mr. Walter Hough, my assistant, has devoted much time 
to this study, and has been able to gather the fire-making tools of 
nearly all the tribes of our aborigines from the farthest north to Cape 
Horn. By study and correspondence he has also found out the methods 
of applying these, until he can, with the simplest savage device, himself 
create lire. Collections have also been made of tinder-boxes, tinder- 
wheels, strike-a lights, stick-matches or "spunks,"' early friction matches, 
lighters, etc., and the series is now nearly complete for this country. 
Mr. Hough has also devoted much time to the arrangement of the il- 
lumination collection, with a view to tilling up the lacuna' and showing 
the elaboration of lighting apparatus. While the collection and instal- 
lation of ancient and foreign lamps has been attended to, special atten- 
tion has been given to procuring the earlier forms in our own country 



284 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

from colonial times down to the era of kerosene. Study has been made 
of the ancestry of the older American lamps, and the forms have been 
traced to Germany, England, Scotland, and other countries — the shapes 
of lamps in the different sections of the United States depending on 
the country from which the immigration came. 

Models have been made of candle-dipping apparatus and other 
objects that could not be procured, or were unsuitable for exhibition. 

Germane to this subject is that of heating. This collection, though 
smaller, has been exhibited and has received several important addi- 
tions within the past year. 

A series to illustrate this whole subject, both by countries aud in its 
elaboration, was sent to the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888. A series 
of antique lamps was contributed to the exhibition of Biblical Archae- 
ology, also shown at Cincinnati. 

The curator has given especial attention to the study of transporta- 
tion on the backs of men and women, to aboriginal hide dressing, to 
aboriginal cradles, aud to the evolution of common tools, the knife, the 
hammer, the saw, etc. To iuterest the boys who visit the Museum, a 
series of "jack-knives" has been arrauged for public inspection, and the 
interest which such a case excites is shown by the gifts made constantly 
to the series. 

In the latter part of the year the curator commenced to collect for 
public reference a card catalogue of the resources of anthropology. By 
this is meant not a bibliography of anthropology, but a guide catalogue 
to the resources of the science, so that a special student, a lecturer, or 
a college professor can be put at once into communication with the 
chief sources of information. For this work a student at the National 
Deaf Mute College, who has spent his leisure and his holidays with me, 
has been specially detailed. By this means the literary resources of 
the department will be made as useful and instructive as the material. 

For the purpose of educating people in correct methods of anthropo- 
logical study great csire was taken in the preparation of exhibits for 
the expositions at Cincinnati and Marietta. 

At the former place were shown a series of charts giving the classi- 
lication of the human species by Hseckel, Topinard, Friedrich Muller, 
Welcker, de Quatrefages, and W. H. Flower, a ma}) of the world 
painted to show the distribution of the chief types of humanity, large 
glass cases fitted up with groups of Zuni and Ute Indians in costume, 
and three hundred painted portraits of individuals belonging to the 
various races of men have been prepared by Mr. A. Z. Shindler. 

Another series to which great attention was paid was a set of vit- 
rines, each devoted to the natural history of a separate art or aseparte 
thing. All the tools and specimens of partly finished work belonging 
to the basket-maker, mat-weaver, root-digger, bread-maker, tanner, 
shoe-maker, bow and arrow maker, etc., were so mounted and illustrated 
as to teach the process of the art. 



DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 285 

Another series was made to teach the lesson of geographical distri- 
bution. For instance, tliree hundred arrows were so mounted and 
labeled as to help the visitor to trace the effect of environment on the 
arrow. In the same way were treated other implements. At Marietta 
another lesson entirely was taught. Here the object was to make the 
ethnic concept supreme. The Makah Indians, living at the northwest 
corner of Washington, were selected, and specimens of their handiwork 
so arranged as to show their homes, dress, handicrafts, arts, social life, 
and religion. The life history of a single group was made manifest. 

The curator has during the year, at the request of the Director of the 
Museum, made three tours of inspection, to examine the Valentine col- 
lection in Richmond, the Western Reserve collection in Cleveland, and 
to study the public and private museums in the vicinity of Boston. 

The first named is an enormous private gallery in the vicinity of 
Richmond illustrating the aboriginal life on the James River. It is 
worthy of a more public installation. In the same collection are about 
one thousand articles from North Carolina made in soft micaceous mate- 
rial absolutely sui r/eneris. The curator was greatly interested in the 
ingenuity manifested in the design and fabrication of these pieces. 

The Western Reserve collection at Cleveland is located in the upper 
story of a building, and should be more attractively exhibited. There 
are in this hall many pieces of great value. It is especially rich in the 
archaeology of Ohio. 

The Peabody Museum at Cambridge exhibits in every room the 
training in anatomy of its two distinguished curators. If we omit the 
National Museum, there is no other place in our country where archae- 
ology is more richly illustrated. In the shell heaps of the whole 
Atlantic coast, the palaeolithic relics of New Jersey, the results of care- 
ful dissection of mounds and graves in the Ohio drainage, this museum 
leaves little to lie desired and presents a great deal worthy of im- 
itation. 

From these tours of inspection the curator returns impressed with 
the great service which may be rendered to science by the co-operation 
of great museums and by friendly assistance rendered to local collec- 
tions, and woidd recommend the preparation of a directory of anthro- 
pological ami archaeological resources in America. 

In lieu of costly expenditures for the purpose of collecting, the cura- 
tor has found it convenient to have in various out-of-the-way places 
local agents and referees, from whom, by patient questioning and care- 
lid collecting, he lias been able to gather material under circumstances 
which confer great value upon it. In this way a cradle, a bow and ar- 
row, a weaving-Stick, a fire-drill, and so forth, may be followed up until 
the student has received complete information from reliable source. 
Especial mention may be here made of Col. .1. I. Allen, Montana; 
Charles Willoughby, Quinaiell ; -I. (1. Swan, I'o.t Townsend, Wash- 
ington; L. Frost, aud N.J. Purcell, California j Lieut, T, Dix Holies,

Edith Blake, Nova Scotia. 

Another method adopted for enriching the department of ethnology 
has been a number of exchanges with museums. During the year a large 
series of objects from our modern Indian tribes was sent to the Peabody 
Museum in Cambridge, for which our collection will receive accessions 
from the explorations of Professor Putnam. 

Exchanges have also been conducted with the Cincinnati Art Museum, 
with Dr. Gosse, of Geneva, Switzerland, with the Royal Ethnological 
Museum in Berlin, and with Mr. Edward Lovett, in England.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES 

IN THE U. S, NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



By Cyrus Adlek, Assistant Curator. 



The word "oriental," as usually understood in museum administra- 
tion or in philological or archaeological circles, covers a broad held. 
India, China, Japan, Siam, Armenia, Persia, Phoenicia, and Cyprus, 
Palestine and the Jews, the Samaritans, Arabia and Mohammedanism, 
Syria and Egypt are included within the range of the American Orien- 
tal Society, or of the Poyal Asiatic Society. The scope of the Interna- 
tional Congress of Orientalists, held in 1889, is indicated by the follow- 
ing division into sections : 

First. Semitic and Islam : 

a. Languages and literatures of Islam. 

b. Semitic languages, other than Arabic ; cuneiform texts and 

inscriptions, etc. 

Second. Aryan. 

Third. African, including Egyptology. 

Fourth. Central Asia and the Far East. 

Fifth. Malay and Polynesia. 

Much of the material which would find place in a department estab- 
lished with such a scope, had been collected for the Museum and in- 
stalled in other departments before the organization of a section espe- 
cially devoted to Oriental Antiquities was contemplated. 

The establishment of this section was due originally to a desire to 
collect in the National Museum copies of the smaller Assyro-Babylouian 
objects preserved in this country. These objects (principally seals) are 
of much importance in connection with the history of the Assyro-llalty 
Ionian religion and art, and the Museum has devised a plan for copying 
them which facilitates their study and exhibition. It is hoped that 
among other results there will grow from this work a catalogue of all 
the Assyro-Babylouian objects preserved in this country. 

The Section of Oriental Antiquities, in view of the limitations upon 
its scope and resources, is practically devoted to Biblical Archaeology — 
to the history, archaeology, languages, arts and religions of the peoples 
of Western Asia and Egypt. Material is ehosen which especially illus- 
trates Biblical history, and labels are prepared from this point of view.

290 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The first six weeks of the fiscal year (which include;! a stay of two 
weeks in Cincinnati) were devoted to the arrangement and labeling of 
the exhibit of Biblical Archaeology for the Centennial Exposition of 
the Ohio Valley. The last two weeks of August, as much time as could 
be spared from the work at the Johns Hopkins University during the 
winter, and the latter part of May and June were speut in arranging, 
labeling and putting on exhibition specimens acquired, in conducting 
correspondence with a view t > increasing the collection, in gathering a 
working library for the use of the Section and of properly accredited 
Orientalists visiting Washington, in the preparation of a report on the 
progress of oriental science in America during 1S88, and in the trans- 
action of the business connected with the meeting of the Eighth Inter- 
national Congress of Orientalists at Stockholm. 

The collection of casts of Babylonian and Assyrian seals has grown 
satisfactorily during the year. 

While attending the exhibition at Marietta, Ohio, in July 1888, Mr. 
W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the Museum, and Mr. J. Elfreth Watkins, 
Curator of the Section of Transportation and Engineering, noticed a 
Persian seal; they secured an impression of this object, which was for- 
warded along with the name of its owner, Maj. E. C. Dawes. The cor- 
respondence which followed, resulted in Major Dawes offering his small 
collection for copy, accompanied by the information of the expected 
return to this country of their collector, the Bev. Dr. J. H. Shedd. Dr. 
Shedd also sent a small collection for copy and gave information of the 
existence of a collection made by himself, but sold some time since; 
through the instrumentality of Mr. A. Van Name, Librarian of Yale 
College, this collection was traced to the hands of Prof. O. C. Marsh, of 
New Haven, who placed it at the disposal of the Museum for copy. 

The small but valuable collection of Miss M. W. Bruce, of New 
York, to which attention was first called by Madame Zenaide A. 
Bagoziu,* was secured for copy through the instrumentality of Madame 
Ragozin. It includes three cylinder seals and six contract tablets. 

President D. C. Gilman, of the Johns Hopkins University called atten- 
tion to a communication from Prof. Spencer F. Baird, under date of Jan- 
uary 29, 1864, in which he referred to objects " collected at Babylon and 
Nineveh, by my old pupil, Rev. Israel S. Diehl." A careful search 
revealed no trace of their whereabouts, but with the assistance of 
Bishop Newman, it was found that they were in possession of Mrs. 
Anna Randall Diehl, of New York, who deposited the collection of 
seals in the Museum, 

The manner of obtaining these small objects has been dwelt upon to 
show how they are scattered throughout the country, and how the 
kind assistance of friends of learning is necessary to rescue them from 
their hiding places.

SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES. 291 

Prof. Paul Haupt, Honorary Curator of the Sectiou, spent the sum- 
mer of 1888 abroad, and visited the Royal Museum of Berlin, and the 
British Museum. From the former he made a selection of casts of 
Assyrian and Egyptian objects, illustrating the collections in the Royal 
Museum of Berlin, the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities at Turin, Italy, 
tbe Louvre at Paris, the Boulak Museum at Cairo, Egypt, and the 
British Museum. Tbe National Museum is indebted to tbe officers of 
the Royal Museum of Berlin for courtesies in its transmission, and for 
excellent packing, whereby the entire collection arrived in good con- 
dition. 

Two Egyptian scarabei, the gift of Miss Aline E. Solomons, Wash- 
ington, a series of Egyptian photographs, and the Egyptian ethno- 
graphic series prepared by Mr. W. Flinders Petrie, have also been 
added to the collection. 

Labels have been prepared for all tbe Assyro-Babyloniau seals men- 
tioned above, as well as for those received during tbe previous year. 
Only a portion of these objects lias thus far been placed on exhibition. 
The labels included a statement of the material of the original when 
known, a history of the original, translation of the inscription, and sig- 
nification of the representation where it could be determined. Labels 
were also prepared for the series of Assyrian photographs from the 
British Museum, the Bonfils photographs, and the Assyrian and Egyp- 
tian objects from the Royal Museum of Berlin. In February space was 
assigned tbe section in the west hall, and on March 2 the collection was 
installed, the larger slabs on frames especially constructed for the pur- 
pose. 

There have been no published researches on the specimens collected, 
though the collection of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian seals lias 
been studied with a view to future publication. It may not be im- 
proper in this connection to call attention to the proposed edition of 
the "Life and Writings of Edward llincks" by the Semitic Seminary 
of the Johns Hopkins University. In July the Acting Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution consented to make the Institution a depository 
for papers and manuscripts sent to this country to further the prosecu- 
tion of the work. Prof. F. Max M idler, of the University of Oxford, 
under date of September L'7, forwarded manuscript letters of Dr. Ilineks 
in his possession ; and under dare of October 29, he kindly offered to 
permanently deposit these letters in the Smithsonian Institution.* 

The Museum secured an interesting Persian astrolabe. After a pre- 
liminary examination it; was submitted to Dr. C. Johnson, jr., Fellow- 
elect in Semitic languages, of the Johns Hopkins University, lieis 
now engaged upon it. and presented a study, suggested by this instru- 
ment, at the May meeting of the American Oriental Society, entitled, 
•• The Chaldean Astronomy."

292 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The catalogue of the section is kept by the Department of Ethnology. 
The number of specimens on exhibition (including one hundred and 
fifty photographs) is about four hundred and twenty -five, with an equal 
number in the reserve and study collections, which include a collection 
of paper squeezes from the Boulak Museum. 

We are indebted for co-operation and assistance, in addition to the 
persons already named, to the Hon. Oscar Straus, ex-United States 
minister at Constantinople; Prof. Howard Osgood, of Rochester, New 
York; Dr. James Grant Bey, of Cairo, Egypt; and Prof. D. G. Lyon, 
of Harvard University. 



REPORT ON THE SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING 
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



By J. ELFRETH Watkins, Curator, 



The routine work in the Section of Transportation and Engineering 
during the fiscal year 1888-'89, was interrupted by my absence from the 
Museum during almost the whole month of July, at the Ohio Valley 
Centennial Exposition, at Cincinnati, where several series of models, 
photographs and drawings were placed upon exhibition, to illustrate 
the successive stages in the development of the art of transportation 
from aboriginal times to the present era of the steam-ship and the loco- 
motive. 

It is believed that this was the first attempt in the history of expo- 
sitions, to present an object-lesson of the development, step by step, of 
our great systems of transportation. 

While this first effort must be regarded as an experiment, it is 
gratifying to know that it met the approval of those interested in pre- 
serving the history of engineering science. This is particularly true of 
the objects in the fourth series alluded to below. 

The exhibit was arranged in seven series. 

The first was intended to show the methods adopted by the aborig- 
ines and early settlers, and contained objects of special local interest 
to the residents of the Ohio Valley and of the old Northwest Territory. 

The second contained only objects illustrating the development of (1) 
the American; and (2) the English locomotive. It is believed that this 
series contained a larger number of objects than had ever before been 
assembled to show the history of the locomotive. 

In the third, illustrating the development of the American passen- 
ger car, the objects were arranged according to dates, rather than as a 
series showing the progress of development. This arrangement was 
made necessary owing to the large number of experiments that were 
made before the present type of American car* came into general use. 



"Many of tlio objects in this aeries were illustrated in "The Evolution of the Rail- 
way Passenger Car," by J. Elfretta Watkins, Harper's Weekly, August 25, 1888.

294 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



Iii the fourth series were exhibited forty-five models,* illustrating the 
development of the American rail and track. In addition to these 
models several rail sections that had been in service prior to 1835 were 
shown, attached by the original fastening to the stone blocks which 
were used by early railway constructors. 

In selecting objects for the fifth series, devoted to the development 
of the American steam-boat and modern steam-ship, many illustrations 
of early attempts at invention, which may be regarded as chimerical, 
were omitted. This series was intended to show the beginnings of ma- 
rine steam engineering, together with a very few types of modern steam- 
ships. 

The sixth series contained maps, showing the beginning and extension 
of the American railway system from 1830 to 1888 ; and in the seventh, 
palanquins, sledges, elephant howdahs, etc., illustrating methods of 
transportation in foreign lauds, were assembled. 

The arrangement of objects in the alcove assigned to the Department 
of Transportation and Engineering at Cincinnati was completed about 
the last of July, when, upon returning to Washington, my attention 
was directed to the rearrangement of the few objects which remained 
upon the floor of the Museum. 

Late in November, 1888, many of the objects in the exhibit alluded 
to above were returned from Cincinnati, requiring a rearrangement of 
the exhibition series,. which was completed early in March. Since that 
date the work of correspondence and the care of the objects which 
have been added to the collection have engrossed as much of my atten- 
tion and time as could be spared from other duties in the Department 
of Property and Supplies, the present organization of which, I trust, 
will permit me to devote more effort to the extension of the Section. 

At the annual convention of the American Society of Civil Engineers 
held at Seabright, New Jersey, June 20-26, 1889, the following preamble 
and resolutions were unanimously adopted : 

Whereas the authorities of the .Smithsonian Institution have established in the 
National Museum at Washington a department devoted to the preservation of the 
history of American Engineering science: 

Resolved, That the American Society of Civil Engineers herehy expresses its grati- 
fication at the estahlishment hy the Smithsonian Institution, with the authority of 
the General Government, of a department in the National Museum for the preserva- 
tion of objects of interest hearing upon the history of American engineering, and 
recommends that American engineers co-operate with the Smithsonian Institution in 
furthering the ohjects for which the Department of Engineering has been established. 

Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution, and to the Curator of the Engineering Department of the National Museum. 

John Bogakt, 
Secretary American Society Civil Engineers. 



* Illustrations of these models may be found in the " Development of the American 
Rail and Track," by J. Elfreth Watkins, read before the annual convention of the 
American Society of Civil Engineers, Seabright, New Jersey, June 21, 1889. 



Section of transportation and engineering. 295 

Among the important accessions received daring the year the follow- 
ing may be noted : 

A handsome Japanese kago, presented by Tokugawalyenari, eleventh 
Taikun of Japan to his daughter, upon her betrothal to Prince Hosokawa 
aDaimio of lligo, 1835, obtained through Hieromich Shugio. This 
kago is made of wood, beautifully lacquered and elaborately embellished 
with crests of the Tokugawa and Hosokawa families. The interior is 
handsomely upholstered and decorated. 

A model of a Japanese jinrikisha (light-covered vehicle with two 
wheels, drawn by a man or boy), together with the small painting which 
accompanies it, gives an excellent idea of the manner in which this 
popular conveyance of Japan, which takes the place of the London cab 
is used. 

Among the objects especially prepared for the Cincinnati Exposition 
which have found a permanent place in the collection, is a series illus- 
trative of the history of transportation before the advent of the loco- 
motive, of which the following are worthy of note: 

Apache squaw with carrying basket (full-size figure), illustrating an 
aboriginal form of burden bearing, since known as "toting" by the 
negroes of the Southern States. 

Pack-mule (mounted specimen), illustrating means adopted by early 
settlers to transport freight across the Alleghany Mountains, the 
pack-saddle and manner of packing being in accordance with prevail- 
ing methods among the mountain " packers." 

Ohio River Hat-boat (model), The Mayflower of the Ohio. It was 
upon a similar boat that the earliest settlers journeyed down the Ohio 
River and disembarked at Marietta. 

Steam-boat Orleans, 1812 (model), the lirst steamboat on the Ohio 
River. This boat was built under the direction of Robert Fulton and 
Nicholas Roosevelt. 

Conestoga wagon, 1785-1830 (model). Wagons of this type were 
used in the transportation of emigrants and freight from the East 
across the Alleghanies to the Ohio and Mississippi Valley. 

Stage coach (model). Type in use between Pittsburgh and Phila- 
delphia in 1825. 

Canal passenger packet-boat, 1840 (model). Type used on the 
Pennsylvania Canal, Columbia to Iloilidaysburg, on the through line, 
Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Through the courtesy of Mr. William J. 
Latta, general agent, and Mr. F. W. Webb, foreman of the Pennsyl- 
vania Railroad Company, at Philadelphia, the last three models 
noted above were constructed at the Philadelphia shops, being a repro- 
duction in miniature of the vehicles and canal packet-boat exhibited 
li\ tin- Pennsylvania Railroad Company in the trades' parade at the 
Celebration of the Centennial Anniversary of the Adoption of the 
Constitution, in Philadelphia, October, 18S7. 

The series illustrating the history of the American locomotive has 



296 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

been very materially strengthened by the addition of several valuable 
models, among them being : 

Trevithick's locomotive, 1804 (model). This was the first steam loco- 
motive to help man, and was designed and constructed by Richard Trevi- 
thick. It ran for several months in 1804 between Panydarren Works 
and the Glamorgan Canal, near Aberdare Junction, Wales, hauling cars 
laden with coal and pig iron. 

John Stevens's experimental locomotive, 1825 (model.) The first 
locomotive built in America- of which there is a reliable record. The 
original locomotive built by John Stevens had a multi-tubular boiler,* 
and was experimented with on a circular track at Hoboken, New 
Jersey, during the years 1825, 1826, 1827, and 1828. This model was 
constructed in the National Museum workshops, from information fur- 
nished by Mr. Francis B. Stevens (a grandson of John Stevens), a dis- 
tinguished mechanical engineer of Hoboken, New Jersey, who rode 
upon the locomotive when he was a boy, and who was thoroughly 
familiar with its construction. 

Locomotive Best Friend, 1830 (model). The first locomotive con- 
structed in America for actual service on a railroad. Built at West 
Point Foundry, New York, for the South Carolina Railroad. Made 
trial trip January 15, 1831. This model is constructed from the original 
drawings in possession of the American Society of Civil Engineers. 

Locomotive John Bull. Camden and Amboy Railroad. India ink 
drawing (on mat 30 by 40) from tracings of the original working draw- 
ings which accompanied the locomotive from Stephenson's Works, New 
Castle-ou-Tyne, showing how the locomotive appeared when set up at 
Bordentown, New Jersey, August, 1831. The tender built at Borden- 
town shortly afterward, was improvised from a small four-wheel con- 
struction car, a whisky hogshead being used for a water-tank. The 
conuecting-rods showu were never used, owing to sharp curves in the 
road. 

Locomotive Sandusky (model). Driving wheels, 4 feet G inches; 
cylinders, 11 by 16 inches. The first locomotive in the State of Ohio, 
1837. This, the first locomotive built by Rogers & Co. (then Rogers, 
Ketchum & Grosvenor), at Paterson, New Jersey, was originally built 
for the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company, but, not 
being accepted by them, was purchased by J. H. James, of Urbana, 
Ohio, president of the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad. It was 
shipped by canal October 14, 1837, and when it arrived iu Sandusky, 
November 17, 1837, not a foot of railroad had been laid in the State. 
The gauge of the wheels of Sandusky, 4 feet 10 inches, thus became the 
established gauge in the State of Ohio. This model was also con- 
structed in the Museum workshops. 

* The original multi-tubular locomotive boiler, constructed by John Stevens in 1825, 
for this experimental locomotive, was deposited in the U. S. National Museum by the 
authorities of the Stevens' Institute, Hoboken, New Jersey, iu the last fiscal year, 
and is referred to iu my auunal report for 1887-'38. 



SECTION OP TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING. 297 

The handsome model of the locomotive Old Ironsides, built by 
Matthias Baldwin in 1832, constructed at considerable expense by the 
Baldwiu Locomotive Works, and presented by them to the Museum, is 
one of the most valuable accessions of the year. This model, accurate 
in every detail, a faithful miniature of the early handiwork of the 
founder of the company which has sent locomotives to every quarter 
of the globe, will be a great aid to the future historians who may wish 
to place upon record the facts connected with the beginnings of loco- 
motive building in America. The original u Ironsides" hauled the first 
passenger train in the State of Pennsylvania. 

Through the courtesy of the Steel Street Railway Company of Johns- 
town, Pennsylvania, who presented the Museum with fourteen sections 
of street rails, and three sets of joint fixtures, it has become the pos- 
sessor of a nucleus of a collection, which it is to be hoped may soon be 
expanded until it shall illustrate the history of the street railway — pre- 
eminently an American invention in the beginning, which has since been 
carried to every pact of the globe. It is highly important that the his- 
tory of a system which has had so much to do with the growth of every 
American city should be preserved. 

It is to be desired that other friends of the Museum will add to this 
nucleus by collecting early forms of street rails and track appliances. 

Through the kindness of Mr. F. W. Webb, of the London and North- 
western Bail way, of England, whose numerous contributions have been 
acknowledged in previous reports, the Section has been enriched by a 
series of graphic photographs of the exterior and interior views of the 
railway carriages occupied by the Queen of England, and other members 
of the royal family, in their journeyings by rail, to different parts of the 
kingdom. The arrangement and decorations of these carriages, especi- 
ally that reserved for H. R. H. the Prince of Wales, are in marked con- 
trast to the palatial "Special" cars used by American railway officials 
and men of wealth. 

Among the railroad relics received is "the bell of the old locomotive 
Rahway, cast in 1838. This bell was one of the first alarm-bells ever 
placed upon a locomotive, the bells which preceded it being generally 
used to communicate signals to the engineer by the conductor or 
brakeman. For this bell, as well as for a section of track, consisting of 
rails and wooden joint blocks, in use for many years on the New Jersey 
Railroad between Jersey City and New Brunswick, the Museum is 
indebted to Mr. James B. Smith, of Newark, New Jersey, one of the 
oldest supervisors on the Pennsylvania Railroad system. 

Another valuable relic is a section of the first heavy iron rail rolled 
in America, a gift of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This rail is f| 
shaped in section and was rolled for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 
Company, in 1*1 1, by the Mount Savage Boiling Mill in Alleghany 
County, Maryland. To commemorate this event the Franklin Institute 
of Philadelphia awarded a silver medal in October, 1844, to the pro- 



298 REPORT OE NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

prietors of the Mount Savage Rolling Mill. A duplicate of this medal 
has been promised by that Institute for the collection. 

A number of valuable drawings illustrating the development of 
marine steam-engineering have been added to that series, among them 
being : 

Print of Jonathan Hull's steam-boat, 1737, from draught published 
according to act of Parliament, 1737. This is the first feasible propo- 
sition for navigating boats by steam on record. 

Rumsey's steam-boat, 1787. This is the boat in regard to the con- 
struction of which General Washington wrote to Rumsey after seeing 
his boat driven by the tide against the stream, and of which there is a 
piece of the original chain-gearing in the collection. 

Steam-boat constructed by John Fitch, 1787. This boat carried pas- 
sengers, who paid fare, between Philadelphia and Burlington, on the 
Delaware River. 

Engine and propeller wheels of steam-boat constructed by John 
Stevens, with twin screws, in 1804 ; on mat 30 by 40 inches, made from 
the original engine in the Museum of the Stevens Institute, Hoboken, 
New Jersey. 

The Clermont, Fulton's first American steam boat. This steam-boat 
made the first trip from New York to Albany in August, 1807, and re- 
mained in continuous service for several years. 

Steam-boat Phani.r, the first steam-boat to navigate the ocean and 
the first vessel built with wave lines. The engine and hull were con- 
structed under the direction of John Stevens, at Hoboken, New Jersey. 
This vessel was launched about fifteen days after the Clermont, and 
made the ocean trip from Sandy Hook to Cape May, on the way from 
New York to Philadelphia, early in 1808. 

Fulton's first ferry system, being au enlarged facsimile of original 
drawing made by Robert Fulton, 1812. This was the system in use at 
Fulton Ferry, New York City, for many years. 

Steam-ship Savannah, the first steam-ship to cross the Atlantic, 1S19. 
This vessel sailed from Savannah May 22, 1819, under command of Capt. 
Moses Rogers, and arrived in Liverpool, June 20, 1819. 

The original log of this voyage in the handwriting of Sailiug-Master 
Steven Rogers is also preserved iu the collection. 

Among the relics relating to early steam-boats which have recently 
been obtained, may be noted : Fac-simile of draught of letter from 
John Stevens, of Hoboken, New Jersey, to Robert Hare, jr., of Phila- 
delphia, written November 16, 1805, describing the steam-boat with 
twin screws, which is illustrated in the drawing alluded to above. 

Also an original copy of the Philadelphia "Federal Gazette and 
Daily Advertiser," published Monday, July 2G, 1790. This paper con- 
tains an advertisement of the time-table of Fitch's steam-boat, showing 
the leaving and arriving time at Philadelphia, Bristol, Burlington, and 
Bordentown. Deposited by Richard G. Stevens. 



SUCTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING. 299 

During the .year an entire re-arrangement of the exhibition series was 
attempted, under the following temporary classification : 

(1) Objects and implements for burthen-bearing by man and animals. 

(2) Objects and implements of human and animal traction (street- 
railway ears excepted). 

(3) Originals, models, and drawings of stationary steam-engines. 

(4) Originals, models, and drawings of locomotives* 

(5) Models and drawings of passenger and freight cars. 

(0) Originals, models, and drawings illustrating the development of 
the American rail and track (steam railways and horse railways.) 

(7) Models, relics, and drawings showing the beginning of the steam- 
boat and development of marine steam-engineering. 

(8) Maps showing beginning and exteusiou of the American railway 
systems. 

■ 

(9) Electrical machines (telegraph and motors). 

(10) Air-ships, etc. 

Owing to the nature of things, the study series is composed almost 
entirely of drawings and other graphic illustrations, in arranging which 
the same general classification has been temporarily adopted as pre- 
vails in the exhibition series. 

1 cannot close this report without calling attention to the necessity 
for additional space, iu order to accommodate the normal growth of the 
Section. 

From personal intercourse and correspondence with a number of 
prominent engineers and railway constructors, I feel satisfied that the 
collection could be rapidly increased by the addition of valuable ob- 
jects, if the space could be found to exhibit them. Iu no country in 
the world has there been such a revolution in the methods of con- 
structing bridges as in America, yet we are compelled to refuse to ex- 
hibit models of the early structures, now rapidly going out of use, 
owing to the crowded condition of the exhibitiou series. And the same 
statement holds good in regard to historic locomotives, cars, and other 
bulky objects, it being possible to devote only GOO square feet of floor 
space to the locomotive and railway car. 

So much progress has been made in solving problems that have 
arisen in connection with electric propulsion, both on land and water, 
during the last few years, that it would seem proper to begin to collect 
objects illustrating the early history of the devices which have gradually 
been developed into the motors, etc., now practically successful and in 
commercial use. 

Such a collection, if properly made, would also require considerable 
space for exhibition, and must therefore be delayed for the present. 



REPORT ON THE SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS 
IN THE U, S, NATIONAL MUSEUM. 1889. 



By S. R. KOEHLEK, Curator, 



Although, this section was organized in January, 1887, no official re- 
port has as yet been made. The report now submitted embraces, there- 
fore, the period between January 1, 1887, and June 30, 1889. 

It will be advisable to preface the general review of the work done 
within this period by some remarks explanatory of the principal aim 
which has been kept constantly in view in the formation of the collec- 
tions of the section of graphic arts, in consouauce with the general 
plan laid out for this section, from the beginning of the present organi- 
zation of the Museum. This aim being of a peculiar character, on the 
one hand, and the notions held by the mass of the people concerning 
the nature and functions of art being, on the other, of the vaguest kind, 
it is often found difficult, even by persons interested in art, to grasp it. 
The concisest way of stating it will be to say, that the aim of the sec- 
tion of graphic arts is to represent art as an industry. This must not, 
however, be understood as implyiug the application of art to industry. 
The expression must be taken in its literal sense, as conveying the idea 
that art productions of all kinds, from the great frescoes of the most 
distinguished painters to the slightest illustration produced by the 
latest photomechanical process, are here to be considered, primarily, 
from their material, that is to say, their technical side. Art thus takes 
its place in the scheme of the Museum, side by side, and on terms of 
equality, with the other great industries, — agriculture, the fisheries, 
mining, transportation, etc. — and the artist is recognized, not merely 
as an ornamental appendage, whose useless labors may be ignored 
with impunity, but as a valuable member in the social organization 
of mankind, whose creations answer to a human want, and whose 
material necessities it is quite as important to understand and minis- 
ter to as those of the farmer, the wool-grower, the fisher, the engineer, 
the weaver, and so on. This view of the matter does not in the least 
degrade art, as those are apt to think who approach it exclusively from 
the sesthetic side. It simply recognizes the fact that art stands upon a 
material basis, in common with all other branches of human activity. 

Jt appears from what has thus far been said that the ultimate aim 

301 



302 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1881). 

of all art — the expression of ideas by artistic nieaus — is uot consid- 
ered directly in the scheme of the section of graphic arts. These 
ideas and their development in the progress of time, are, nevertheless, 
also illustrated, or eventually will be, for, in pursuing the study of 
the technical means employed in the graphic arts, it is necessary to 
inquire into their historical evolution, and this can not be done by a 
mere bringing together of the tools and materials used at different 
times. It unavoidably involves an examination of the results, and 
these latter tend to show that the tools and materials themselves were 
influenced by the ideas which sought expression. An historical col- 
lection of specimens illustrating the progress of the graphic arts is, 
therefore, quite as much a necessity as a collection of tools and mate- 
rials, and it is obvious that such a collection will furnish the oppor- 
tunity also for the study of the intellectual aspect of art. The appar- 
ently purely material and unintellectual starting point of the scheme 
laid out for the section of graphic arts, thus leads in the end to a much 
broader, as well as profouuder, illustration of the subject in hand than 
can possibly be provided in ordinary museums of art which ignore 
means and deal with results only. Naturally, in endeavoring to bring 
together a series of examples illustrating the technical activity of the 
artist, it is found much easier to acquire prints of all kinds than draw- 
ings and paintings. This difficulty it has been sought to overcome in 
a measure by adding a collection of photographs from paintings, etc. 
These, however, can give but a very inadequate idea of technical pecu- 
liarities, while, on the other hand, they add largely to the illustration 
of the progress of ideas as expressed in art. 

For the sake of completeness it may be well to state here that the 
section of graphic arts confines itself strictly within the limits indi- 
cated by its name, that is to say, to drawing and painting and the 
various methods of producing pictures to be multiplied in the press, 
or, in other words, to the various methods of delineation on surfaces. 

As comparatively but little material (308 numbers in all) had been 
collected at the time when t took charge of the section, the first thing 
to be done, in the almost total absence of means wherewith to make 
purchases, was to solicit contributions from artists, publishers, and 
private persons. The measure of success attained is shown by the 
list of donors and depositors printed as Appendix A. Of the 2,891 
entries in the catalogue up to June 30, 18S9, only 294 represent objects 
purchased, at a cost of $2,308.23,* — mostly old prints and such tools, 
etc., as could not be obtained as gifts. Among these purchases (occa- 
sioned principally by the Ohio Valley Centennial Exposition, at which 
the section of graphic arts was represented by a special exhibition) 
there are some very tine and important examples of engraving and 
etching, such as Rembrandt's " Christ Preaching," known as " Le petit 

*In this statement the collection of photographs acquired before I was appointed, 
is not included, as it has not yet been registered, 



SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS. 303 

La Tombe," B G7, certainly one of the most beautiful impressions of 
this admirable plate in existence ; very good impressions of Diirer's 
" St. Jerome in his Chamber," B GO, and " The Great Horse," B 97 ; a 
iine proof of Nanteuil's " Pompone de Bellievre," B-D 37 ; a splendid 
proof, before the coatof-arms, of Wille's " Satin Gown," Le Bl 55; a 
subscriber's impression, before any of the later retouches, of Midler's 
" Madonna di S. Sisto," after Raphael, etc. It will be quite impossible 
to speak here at length of the many valuable gifts received during the 
period under review. Some idea of their importance may be gathered 
from the details given in the list of donors and depositors, which in- 
cludes also the material received previous to my official connection 
with the Museum, such as the collection illustrating the etching process, 
given by Mr. Peter Moran ; the collection illustrating the technical 
processes of lithography and chromo-lithography, given by Messrs. L. 
Prang & Co.; the exhibit of the Photo-Engraving Company, and that 
illustrating the process of electrotyping made by Messrs. W. H. Whit- 
comb & Co. Two items must, however, be emphasised here as being 
of special importance and fitness in the U. S. National Museum. I 
allude to the plate, with a set of trial proofs, of Asher Brown Dnrand's 
" Ariadne," after Yanderlyn, given by his sou, Mr. John Durand, and 
to the collection of proofs from plates engraved by Johu Cheney, given 
by his sister-in-law, Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney. Generally speaking, 
special stress has been laid, in the historical division, upon a good 
representation of Americau art, and the list of donors again will show 
that these efforts have been liberally seconded by artists, publishers, 
and other friends of the Museum. 

The time from January, 1887, to February, 1888, was given up wholly 
to the collecting of specimens and the preparation of cases. During 
the months of February and March, 1888, these specimens were placed 
on exhibition on the western side of the northwest range. The extent of 
the collection at that time, and the arrangement adopted, are shown by 
the placard which was prepared for display in the hall, a copy of which 
is annexed to this report as Appendix B. 

Part of the month of May, the month of June, and part of July of the 
same year were devoted to the preparation and installation of the ex- 
hibition of the section of graphic arts at the Ohio Valley Centennial 
Exposition at Cincinnati. To avoid the almost total depletion of the 
exhibition cases at the Museum, the greater part of the specimens 
shown at this exhibition was borrowed lor the purpose, and the lack of 
specimens, representative of the work of the past, necessitated the pur- 
chases above alluded to, which were paid for out of the special appro- 
priation made by Congress to defray the expenses of the Smithsonian 
Institution arising out of its participation in the Exposition. A more 
detailed account of this exhibition will be found in the catalogue, printed 
in the "Proceedings United States National Museum, Vol. x., Appen- 
dix," The rapid growth of the collection, from 036 entries in the cata- 



304 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

logue on March 31, 188S, the time when the first arrangement of speci- 
mens in the Museum was completed, to 2894 on June 30, 1889, making 
necessary a re-arrangement and expansion, the whole of the northwest 
range was given up to the section of graphic arts, the casts from Mexi- 
can sculptures, etc., which had occupied its eastern half having been 
removed to the Smithsonian building, and the exhibition as it stands 
at this writing was put into place during the months of May and June, 
1889. As arranged at present, the eastern side of the hall is occupied 
by the technical exhibition, illustrating the older processes of producing 
pictures for multiplication in the press (relief engraving, intaglio en- 
graving, lithography, and the substitutes devised to take the place of 
these processes), aids in drawing used by engravers and by draughtsmen 
for photo-mechanical processes, methods of reducing and enlarging, and 
the modem photo-mechanical processes (phototyping, photogravure, 
photolithography, collographic processes, Woodburytype, etc.). On 
the western side are shown the specimens illustrating the various 
methods of drawing and painting, with the monotype, and the histor- 
ical collection of relief engravings, intaglio engravings, lithography, 
and color printing. As an appendix there have been added some speci- 
mens showing the industrial applications of printing. The collection 
of photographs, illustrating the history of painting, is also displayed 
on this side of the hall. The arrangement adopted has already, how- 
ever, shown itself inadequate, and a re-arrangement and filling up of 
gaps is impending, although the lack of space will preclude any con- 
siderable further expansion. 

It has been impossible, of course, to place on exhibition all the ma- 
terial collected, and the large number of specimens left over has been 
roughly arranged, under technical headings, in two storage cases. As 
the collection grows, it is to be hoped that this mass of interesting and 
valuable material may be made available to students. For the present, 
all that can be done is to provide for its safe-keeping. The culling and 
arrangement of duplicates, to be used for exchanging, also remains to 
be attended to. It is not to be expected, however, that this feature will 
attain the same proportions iu the section of graphic arts which it has 
attained in other departments of the Museum, dealing with the prod- 
ucts of nature. During the period covered by this report only one 
specimen has been obtained by exchange. 

A most valuable subdivision of the section, specially important from 
its practical bearings, is that devoted to patents relating to all the 
graphic arts, including the modern photomechanical processes. Under 
the direction of Mr. J. W. Osborne, of Washington, who has given his 
advice and time gratuitously, lists of such patents issued in all coun- 
tries are now being made, and many of them have already been pro- 
cured. But the completion of this work and its utilization by the 
public must be deferred to the future. 

A pressing necessity, finally, is the labeling of the specimens ex- 



SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS. 30T) 

hihitcd and the preparation of an elementary manual for the use of 
visitors, without which the collection is practically useless. All that 
can be said concerning this matter is that a number of essays have been 
made which, it is hoped, wdl lead to a result before long. 

The present state of the collection, so far as the number of entries 
on the catalogue shows it, has already been alluded to. On June 30, 
L888, there were 1,071 entries, showing that the additions during the 
liscal year just ended were 1,223, making a total of 2,894 on June 30, 
1889. Of these entries 26 were loans which have been returned. These 
are more than offset, however, by the entries which represent series 
consisting of several specimens, so that the number of specimens actu- 
ally constituting the collection may safely be said to be considerably 
over 3,000. How many of these are on exhibition and how many in 
the reserve collection it is impossible to say, as the specimens on exhi- 
bition have not yet been numbered. The varied character of the col- 
lection can in a measure be ascertained from the list of donors and 
depositors which accompanies this report.* 

Unfortunately this list does not include one of the most important 
gifts received during the year, the collection, namely, of Mr. J. W. Os- 
borne, which has not yet been registered, although many of the most 
important specimens in it have already been placed on exhibition. 
This collection contains, besides a very full record of the development 
of Mr. Osborne's own photolithographic process, specimens by many of 
the earliest experimenters in the same and similar directions, such as 
Fox Talbot, Paul Pretsch, Poitevin, Asser, etc., together with fine ex- 
amples of lithography, engraving, etc. 

The condition and extent of the section of graphic arts has been thus 
far, and still is, such as to preclude the possibility of special researches 
upon the material belonging to it, and it is to be feared that it will be a 
long while before the opportunity for such researches can be offered. 
Papers by collaborators there are none, since there are no collaborators. 
My own activity as a student and with the pen during the period em. 
braced by this report has necessarily been quite limited, as my time has 
been taken up almost entirely by the routine work and the purely man. 
ual labor which my position in this museum and as curator of the print 
department at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston have forced upon 
me. A list of the few papers, etc., that I have published during the 
year will be found in the Bibliography (Section IV). Several papers 
were published during the time of my connection with the Museum 
previous to the liscal year of 188:-'89. These are noticed in the Museum 
report for 1887-'88.

306 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

to Jane 30, 1889, I beg leave to add some suggestions concerning the 
future. 

The first and most important point to be kept in view, if the growth 
of the section of graphic arts is not to be arrested, and if it is the desire 
io build it up normally and properly proportioned in all its parts, is the 
n ecessity of an adequate yearly appropriation. The appeal to artists, 
publishers, and others has, indeed, been liberally responded to, but it 
goes without saying that a collection depending almost wholly upon 
gifts can not possibly attain to the logical development, the complete- 
ness, and the superlative quality which alone would answer the ends 
sought, and be worthy of a great nation claiming to occupy the first 
rank in material welfare and in intellectual attainments. An even 
cursory examination of the collection as it now stands will show that 
it is deficient in many respects, and that in a number of cases specimens 
have been admitted without regard to quality simply because they 
illustrated some technical point and could be had for nothing, it is 
vain to expect gifts of valuable drawings, paintings, and old prints, 
exceptupon rare occasions and at long intervals. Such specimens must 
be bought, and it is, moreover, necessary that the curator should be in 
a position to secure them whenever and wherever they offer. Really 
desirable specimens rarelv have to wait for a purchaser, and such oppor- 
tunities must therefore be quickly seized when they occur. 

While, as has been pointed out, the principal aim of the section of 
graphic arts is to represent art as an industry, there are yet other 
possibilities within its grasp that should not be lost sight of, and of 
which it may, indeed, be said that they are the natural outgrowth of its 
activity. The attempt to illustrate the technical processes of graphic 
art and the historical development of these processes unavoidably 
leads, as has already been shown, to the formation of a collection em- 
bodying the results reached, that is to say, to a collection of drawings, 
paintings, and prints. It will probably be advisable to restrict the 
acquisition of drawings and paintings, for the present at least, to only 
such examples as are absolutely necessary for the elucidation of strictly 
technical details. There is less call, however, for such a restrictive 
policy in the case of prints. A print collection is very far from being 
simply a means of ministering to Aesthetic desires. It may be put to 
almost unlimited practical uses, and is quite as much an educational 
apparatus as a collection of books. Indeed, it might be claimed that 
it is often a much more powerful educational instrument, since prints 
present to the eye what books endeavor merely to construct in the 
mind. A print collection, therefore, is not only strictly within the 
province of the Smithsonian Institution ; it is, indeed, one of the means 
of instruction which it is in duty bound to provide as an institution for 
the dissemination of learning. This universal value of print collections, 
the artistic aspect of which is only a subordinate feature, has long been 
recognized in Europe, and it is about time that their importance should 



SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS. 307 

be realized also on this side of the water. It will, of course, be a long 
time before we can hope to equal such great national collections as that 
of the British Museum with its uncounted treasures, the French collec- 
tion with its more than two millions of specimens, or the Print Cabinet 
at Berlin with over a million and a half, but this conviction ought all 
the more to spur us on to make at least a beginning as soon as possible, 
more especially as the prices oi prints are going up with unpleasant 
rapidity, and as a most favorable opportunity for such a beginning is 
just now offering. In saying 'his I have in mind the Sewall collection, 
which is for sale in New York, and which can be bought at a figure 
representing about one-third of what would be its value if the speci- 
mens composing it had to be bought in open market. The collection 
contains about eighteen thousand prints, representing all periods and 
schools, and is the result of forty years'' collecting. I would respect- 
fully recommend that a special appeal be made to Congress to secure 
this collection for the U. S. National Museum. 1 would furthermore 
suggest that what is left of the Marsh collection, bought by Congress 
in L849, be definitely turned over to the Section of Graphic Arts. Un- 
fortunately the largest and most desirable parts of this collection, 
including all the tine Diirers, Reinbrandts, etc., which the origiual 
inventory enumerates, have unaccountably disappeared, but there still 
remain several volumes of single prints, and, presumably, the various 
gallery works, etc., belonging to it, which, if added to the present col- 
lections ot the section, would considerably increase their interest. The 
prints m question ought, however, to be taken out of the volumes into 
which they have been pasted, and ought to be carefully examined and 
mounted on separate sheets, so that they can be classified scientifically. 
As at present arranged, these volumes are not much more than picture 
hooks for the gratification of idle curiosity. 

In a print collection, the property of the people of the United States, 
America ought, as a, matter of course, to receive tin? fullest share of 
attention. It has been my constant endeavor, as before stated, to give- 
due prominence to American art in the collection in my charge, and in 
these efforts I have been liberally seconded by artists, publishers, and 
others. But again, by mere reliance upon gifts, the aim to be followed 
cannot lie reached, and this aim ought not to be less than to make the 
division of Americana t he first of its kind among the insl itutions of the 
United States, so thai all investigators may in the future turn to it with 
the jusl expectation that here they will find the best and richest mate- 
rial lor then' researches. It would seem possible to take an important 
step towards the attainment of this end without cost to the nation as 
represented through government. Under the copyright law two copies 
of each copyrighted print, book,etc, are deposited in the Congressional 
Library. I would respectfully recommend that Congress be asked to 
pass a law directing that one copy of each copyrighted print, illus- 
trated book, etc., now in the Congressional Library be turned over to 



308 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

tbe V. S. National Museum, to be there deposited iu the section of 
graphic arts, aud that all similar matter henceforth received be simi- 
larly divided between the Congressional Library and the U. 8. National 
Museum. 

Another need of the section of graphic arts is a special library. 
Even in the present embryonic condition of its collections, books of 
reference are often wanted which ought to be at hand for immediate 
use if they are to be of any use at all. The Marsh collection again 
offers a nucleus of great value, and I would venture the further sug- 
gestion that the books belonging to it be turned over to this section. 
Thus placed they will do good service, whereas at present they do lit- 
tle or none. The attention given to such a special library ought not, 
however, to stop here. In accordance with the original aim of the 
section, it is quite indispensable that it should collect all technical aud 
historical treatises relating to the graphic arts, and more especially the 
former. So far as American productions of this kind are concerned, 
the direct aid of Congress might again be invoked here. It is desirable 
also, and indeed necessary, that a number at least of the journals 
dealing with the graphic arts should be kept, including those in which 
the developments of the modem photo-mechanical processes are 
recorded. 

It stands to reason that the plans for the future so far outlined can 
not be carried out, unless considerably more room can be devoted to the 
collections, and unless the service can be provided which will make it 
possible to throw them open for the use of students. It will be quite 
impossible, and, indeed, would not be desirable if it were possible, to 
exhibit all the material collected and to be collected. Hooms will, there- 
fore, have to be set apart in which the portfolios aud cases containing 
the reserves can be kept, with the possibility of expansion in the future, 
and providing also the necessary space for tables for visitors, and, in 
connection with these, public rooms, special Workrooms not accessible 
to ordinary visitors, in which mounting, restoring, classifying, etc., can 
be carried on. Before a definite plan is adopted for the arrangement of 
these rooms, it would of course be necessary to make a thorough study 
of similar institutions iu Europe, so as to assure the adoption of the 
system which actual experieuce has shown to be the best. 

That such collections, liberally administered, might be made of the 
greatest use, both educationally and practically, does not admit of the 
slightest doubt. Their educational value has already been dwelled 
upon, and I may, therefore, confine myself to a few closing remarks upon 
their practical use to the busy portion of mankind to whom art really 
is an industry. To these workers the section of graphic arts might 
easily be made a central bureau of reference. It is already beginning 
to assume the character of an archive, in which are deposited the 
records of the labors of inventors within its sphere. Thus it has in its 
keeping the original Saxtou engraving machine, and its collections com- 



SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS. 309 

prise as full records as it will ever be possible to gather of the develop- 
ment of the Osborne photo-lithographic and of the original Ives half- 
tone process, while several other inventors have promised to prepare 
similar records of their achievements. That such material, together 
with the patents now collecting, must be of inestimable value to future 
inventors is self-evident. With a view to the further extension of the 
practical utility of the section, all makers of machinery and tools, and 
manufacturers and dealers in materials used in the graphic arts are 
encouraged to send not only specimens of their wares, but also their 
circulars and catalogues, and the latter are given or sent to applicants 
for information to whom they promise to be of interest. Few such ap- 
plications have, indeed, been received so far, but it is to be Loped that 
as the character aud aims of the section of graphic arts become more 
widely known, the facdities which it offers, or hopes to be able to offer,* 
will be utilized more freely. 

It will, I think, need no further argument to show that the section 
of graphic arts may be made not only a valuable institution for the 
scholar and the student, but that it may become practically useful to 
the large body of men and women who depend upon the graphic arts 
as a pursuit, quite as much as the Bureau of Education, the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, or the Fish Commission are helpful to the teacher, 
the farmer, and the fisherman.

TRATING THE GRAPHIC ARTS. 

It is the aim of the Section of Graphic Arts to illustrate all the methods and proc- 
esses ever used for the expression, graphically upon plane surfaces, of artistic 
ideas, or for the representation of natural and other objects. It therefore embraces 
drawing and painting, as well as the various methods of engraving, so far as the 
latter have been used for the production of prints. The held is a vast one, aud the 
present collection must be looked upon as only a fragmentary attempt to illustrate 
the main poiuts in the scheme. The collection is arranged as follows :

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY 

IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1!! ,!, » 



By Thomas Wilson, Honorary Curator. 



The general character of the work for the year ending June 30, 1880, 
has been much the same as in former years, although there have been 
changes and much extra work. Implements of the usual character 
have been received and have been examined, classified, arranged, en- 
tered and numbered, as formerly. To this customary routine were the 
added duties incident to the Cincinnati Exposition (whicli opened July 4, 
1888, and closed November 15, 1888), the investigation of paleolithic 
implements and of rude notched axeis, and other matters, involving a 
great increase of the clerical work of the office. The number of imple- 
ments received, to be catalogued and displayed, has been largely in- 
creased, and likewise the number of objects sent for examiuatiou and 
report. 

The reception of three hundred new trays during the year gave an 
opportunity long desired, to place specimens in trays instead of loosely 
upon the shelves and bottoms of the cases. In November 1888, the 
work of repainting the trays and cases was begun, requiring the re- 
moval and changing of position from case to case of every tray and 
specimen in the entire collection. This work has been continued until 
the present time. It is now almost finished. 

During the last two and a half months of the year, carpenters and 
laborers have been at work putting new shelves in the cases, wherever 
possible, to utilize vacant space (this work is not completed); placing 
shelves in the window-seats for the reception of the stone images from 
Central America and the West Indies, twenty of which are thus dis- 
played; and placing casters under the tall upright cases, seventeen 
of whicli are thus arranged. This has been preparatory to the pro- 
posed re-arrangenient of the cases in the Museum, placing four rows 
of cases instead of three, as before, and making three aisles, one of 
which is the center, instead of four aisles as heretofore. By this ar- 
rangement much space is gained. The cases which before approached 
the center of the hall, and so nearly covered it, are now retired towards 
either cud of the hall, leaving a large space in the center which affords 
room for rearrangement and better display of the Pueblo village mod- 
els and the Mexican architectural sculptures (Lorillard and Abadiauo 

317 



318 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

collections) which have heretofore been so much crowded as to do them 
injustice. The main aisles among the cases are slightly narrower than 
before, but by the substitution of single for double cases, as heretofore 
employed, the lateral aisles have been widened so as to afford ample 
relief against any crowd, however large. I am satisfied that we could 
manage without crowding the 29,000 persons who visited the museum 
on the 5th day of March 1889, and that this arrangement of cases is an 
improvement. 

IMPORTANCE OF THE SCIENCE OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 

Prehistoric anthropology is a new science. During the past eighteen 
hundred years the Christian, and, consequently, the civilized world, has, 
untilthe beginning of the nineteenth century, lived on in the belief that 
man's appearauce upon earth dated no more than 4,000 years before the 
commencement of our era, and was without knowledge of prehistoric 
man, nor did it have a suspicion of his existence. 

The wise men of Denmark in the early part of the nineteenth century, 
while investigating and studying the Runic characters and legends 
engraved upon their ruined stones, and in their sagas, discovered evi- 
dences of a human occupation of their country earlier than any of which 
they had heretofore known or suspected. This occurred about 180G, 
and in 183G Mr. Thompson the renowned Danish archaeologist (who 
founded, and for fifty years directed, the prehistoric museums at 
Copenhagen) published his first memoir in regard to prehistoric civili- 
zation, which he named after the material principally employed for cut- 
ting implements, "The Ages of Stone, Bronze, and Iron." These divis- 
ions have ever since been universally accepted. 

In 1854 Dr. Ferdinand Keller recognized at Meilen on Lake Zurich, 
Switzerland, certain evidences which developed into our present knowl- 
edge of the Swiss Lake-dwellers, although it has since been proved 
that lake-dwellings existed in many other countries of Europe. 

Beginning with 1841, M. Boucher de Perthes, residing at Abbeville, 
on the river Somme, discovered certain flint implements rudely chipped 
in the shape of an almond or peach-stone, with the cutting edge at the 
point. He found them deep in the gravelly terraces of the river Somme, 
and in such position and association as to force the conclusion that fchey 
were the handiwork of man and of an antiquity before unsuspected. 
His labors were continued with varying success in the gaining of con- 
verts until the year 1859, when, by agreement, a committee of fifteen 
gentlemen, supposed to be best qualified for the task, and in their 
departments certainly the most learned men of France and England, 
met on the ground for the purpose of making personal investigations. 
After discussion, dispute, and difference of opinion, of which I need not 
speak here, it was finally decided that M. Boucher de Perthes was cor- 
rect in his theory, and that these implements were the work of man 
and of an antiquity heretofore unknown. 



DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 319 

Bere was born the new science of prehistoric anthropology, and 
since then it lias not only been recognized as a science, but whenever 

ami wherever it has been studied and understood, it has increased in 
dignity and importance. 

KNOWLEDGE OP PREHISTORIC MAN EARLIER IN AMERICA THAN EUROPE. 

I have said that the civilized world had, until the beginning of the 
nineteenth century, lived without knowledge of prehistoric man, and 
without even a suspicion of Ins existence. This is more true in Europe 
than in America. The knowledge of prehistoric man began on this 
continent several hundred years before it did in Europe. Columbus 
formed his acquaintance on the discovery of America. The white man 
upon arriving beheld the prehistoric man face to face, and had ample 
opportunities for knowing, studying, and finding out everything that 
was discoverable from contact with him. Though many books have 
been written about the prehistoric man of America, and their authors 
have described him as they saw him, yet we know but little of his true 
nature. The scientific study of this subject has begun only of late 
years, and we are still ignorant concerning his history or life prior to 
the discovery of America in 1402; whence became, to what race he be- 
longed, or what were his habits, customs, or monuments. We are even 
wanting in knowledge of those things peculiar to him since that time, 
and which have been manifested to us in every period of our contact 
with him. The study of his language, sociology, religion, mythology, 
has but just commenced. Many have written descriptions of their visits 
to the Red Man of North America, have given histories of their travels, 
and have written entertaining books on the subject. But these have 
largely been fugitive, isolated, and without connection with any other 
than the tribe visited, the voyage described, or the travel undertaken. 
Nor was there any connection proposed between those writers who 
might have taken up the same line of investigation with other tribes or 
in other parts of the country. I would not dwarf or belittle the labors or 
discoveries of our pioneers ; but, conceding for them all that their friends 
can claim, they have done but little toward giving an accurate or com- 
prehensive anthropologic and ethnologic history of the North American 
Indians. As to their history in prehistoric times, before Columbus, no 
attempt was made by these historians. Collections have been made of 
the implements of the North American Indian, and large prehistoric 
museums established in nearly all parts of the United States, beginning 
back a hundred years or more, which arc and will be of great interest 
and value in writing such a history. Bui in the majority of these cases 
the work has been that of collectors, sometimes for commerce, but more 
often co gratify that thirsl for things of antiquity which seems a part 
of the second nature of mankind. A study of anthropology will he 
scarcely claimed by any one as the motive on which these collections 

were based. So. while we Lave had an earlier knowledge in America 



320 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

of prehistoric man, it has not attained to the dignity and importance, 
as a science, which it has in Europe. 

The Smithsonian Institution, National Museum, Bureau of Ethnol- 
ogy, Peabody Museum, and several other institutions whose names will 
occur to the reader, are exceptions to this statement. There are many 
private persons who should also be excepted, and the number, I am 
gratified to say, who are giving serious attention to this matter and are 
doing faithful and valuable work in this connection, is increasing each 
year. 

I have considered, as part of my duty, the endeavor to awaken and 
elevate the public mind to the importance of the new science of prehis- 
toric anthropology, and, so far as possible, prevent the search for In- 
dian relics as a matter of commerce, and cause collectors to regard 
these objects in their true light as aids to science; not as gewgaws and 
trinkets. 

In-the performance of this duty I have, during the past year, deliv- 
ered ten public lectures; distributed from my office several hundred 
copies of circular No. 47, descriptive of the prehistoric exhibit at the 
Cincinnati Exposition, that has a bearing in this direction, and have writ- 
ten (not yet published) a study of prehistoric anthropology which, be- 
ing intended for general distribution, it is hoped will not be without its 
effect. There has been also prepared a circular (No. 49) containing in- 
formation for the guidance of explorers and collectors. 

IMPORTANCE OF THE SCIENCE OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY BETTER RECOG- 
NIZED IN EUROrE THAN IN AMERICA. 

Despite the fact that the discovery of prehistoric man in Europe was 
so many years, possibly so many hundreds of years, later than his dis- 
covery in America, 1 am compelled by the facts to declare that Europeans, 
because of their interest in the new science, have established prehis- 
toric anthropology on a broader basis and a tinner foundation, and have 
given to it more thorough and scientific treatment than has been done 
in the United States. If I make a comparison in this regard between 
the two countries to the detriment of our own, it will only be that we 
may benefit thereby, may take warning and so redouble and direct our 
efforts, using the opportunity and material which we have in such im- 
proved methods and increased endeavors that in future years the dif- 
ference will not be to our disadvantage. If the following statements 
will direct the attention and increase the energy of our scientists to 
proper exertions in this regard, I shall feel amply repaid for my labor. 

Our acquaintance with the aborigines of this country began with Co- 
lumbus in 1492, but the real history and our first actual knowledge of 
them began no earlier than 1600, probably JG01 or 1008 — now only two 
hundred and eighty years ago. Americans, therefore, of the present 
day are removed from the prehistoric man of the whole country only by 
that period, nor is it even so long, for this was the commencement of 



DEPARTMENT OP PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 321 

our knowledge. The authors at that time saw him face to face, and 
were thus enabled to describe him and write his history. He has con- 
tinued with us ever since, and we have from that time to the present 
Had full and ample opportunity to increase our information concerning 
him by investigation, examination, and personal contact. 

In France and England, in fact over all Western Europe, the period 
when the last possible contact with prehistoric man could have taken 
place, the time when all our knowledge concerning him, acquired from 
observation, was gained, ended with the invasion by Caesar. So that, 
while the American goes back no further than two hundred and eighty 
\ ears to study the prehistoric man of his country, and has had him pres- 
ent ever since, tin- Frenchman, the European, has to go back nigh two 
thousand years, and his opportunities of personal contact ended at that 
time, if if had not done so before; for it is not at all certain that the 
Gaul of that epoch is to be considered as prehistoric. He may have 
been related to him, possibly his descendant, but it appears certain 
that the prehistoric bronze age had ended in that country, and the iron 
age begun, from four hundred to nine hundred years before the advent 
of Caesar. 

1 have said this much to show the difference in the respective oppor- 
tunities for the study of prehistoric man between Europeans and Amer- 
icans. The territory of France is about 200,000 square miles ; that of 
the United States is about 3,600,000 — eighteen times larger than France. 
Mile for mile and acre for acre, the United States will yield as much to 
the student of prehistoric archaeology as will that of France; yet with 
this difference in area of equal fruitfuluess, the United States Govern- 
ment is far behind that of France in its interest and assistance given to 
this science. Compare the National Museum of France, to wit, that of 
St. Germain, with the department of the National Museum of the United 
States. The St. Germain Museum is installed at St. Germain -en-Laye, 
a few miles out of Paris — the palace of that name, built by Francis I. 
1 have not the exact dimensions, but it is in the form of a triangle; the 
front or shortest line is, I should say. 400 feet long. It is given up en- 
tirely to the officers of the institution and to the chambers and living 
apartments of the officers. The other line of the right angle has been 
(in-- proofed throughout and completely restored, and is now occupied 
with the halls of exhibition. This restoration is being continued upon 
the other wing. The work began in 1879 and is not yet completed. 
The building is four stories high, and there are now twenty-five halls 
tilled with prehistoric objects and open to the public. One entire story 
US devoted each to the paleolithic and neolithic periods of the stone age 
and one to the bronze age, while the basement contains the heavy 
stone, principally architectural monuments, of the Roman occupation. 

Except the latter, the display made, the objects shown, the epochs, 
periods, or ages represented, are the same as those now crowded into 
my hall. With all her wealth of antiquity eighteen times greater than 
H. Mis. l'4T, pt. 2 21 



322 KEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

that of France, the Uuited States devotes to the objects and implements 
of her prehistoric races less than one-eighteenth part of the museum 
space occupied by France. 

In the management and direction of tbis museum and of matters per- 
taining to this new science there exists about the same difference. 
The director of the museum is a member of the institute and approxi- 
mates in the dignity and importance of his position to that of the Secre- 
tary and the Director of our entire National Museum. The work of the 
Bureau of Ethnology is committed into the hands of a commission of 
savants of which M. Henry Martin, the great French historian, was, 
and M. Gabriel de Mortillet, Depute, is, the chief. 

I shall not attempt to compare the work of this commission with its 
representative in the United States, but I may indicate the difference 
when I say that the monuments belonging to the prehistoric age, which 
are attached to the soil and part of the real estate which have been 
purchased, restored, and are now owned by the Government of France, 
are to be numbered by the score, if not by the hundred. 

The department of prehistoric anthropology in the British Museum 
has for its curator an eminent man of science, who receives a salary of 
£1,500 per annum, equal to $7,500. 

The Museum of the Irish Academy of Dublin possesses a greater 
value in prehistoric gold ornaments alone than it has cost the United 
States for our entire Museum, with all its specimens, services, manage- 
ment, and furniture. 

The Prehistoric Museum of Antiquities at Edinburgh, Scotland, is 
also extensive. It is devoted exclusively to the antiquities of its own 
country, and forms a complete museum in itself. It has at its head for 
curator, and for assistant and secretary, Professor Anderson and Dr. 
Arthur Mitchell, names which stand as high in their science as do any 
others of their country in any science. 

The Prehistoric Museum at Copenhagen is so extensive and so rich 
that it might be classed as one of the wonders of the world. It occu- 
pies the entire palace of the Prince, has eight exhibition halls, with a 
full corps of professors, curators, etc., who occupy the highest ranks in 
science. The riches of this museum are almost beyond computation 5 
10,000 polished stone hatchets and axes, the contents of 11 workshops, 
one alone of which furnished 200 hatchets, 58 percoirs, 4,000 scrapers, 
1,426 arrow-heads, trenchant transversal', 51 cases of bronze imple- 
ments and ornaments; and gold objects so numerous and valuable that, 
though kept on exhibition during the day (under lock and key, of 
course), are taken out each night and stored for safety in an immense 
steel safe. 

Stockholm has a national museum devoted entirely to prehistorics, 
for which the government has organized a bureau aud erected a fine 
museum building, with Messrs. M. M. Hildebrand and Montelieus as 
professors 



DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 323 

The University of Laud devotes the basement story to its prehistoric 
museum, with Professor Soderberg for its professor aud lecturer. 

The university at Upsala, one of the oldest and finest in all Europe, 
is cu gaged in the same direction. 

The university at Cliristiania, Norway, has also the same kind of ar- 
rangement. Rygh and CJudset are its professors. An idea can be had 
of the importance with which prehistoric science is viewed in this coun- 
try, when I s;iy that the numismatic museum of Christiauia possesses 
a finer collection of United States coins and medals than does our Na- 
tional Museum, and still their desire to keep their own antiquities is 
so great that they refuse to exchange them for those of any foreign 
country. 

The mention of these Scandinavian museums with the names of some 
of their professors will give but a faint idea of the dignity which has 
been accorded to the science of prehistoric anthropology in those coun- 
tries and the attention which it has there received. These countries 
are entitled to and they have maintained a leading place in the science. 
So much so that he who was its acknowledged head in Europe and the 
world, Worsaae, was taken into the King's cabinet and served the later 
years of his life as minister of public instruction. 

I need not mention the great prehistoric museums of Germany: that 
at Berlin with Virchow, probably the leading anthropologist of the 
world, at its head ; that at Munich under the direction of Dr. Johannes 
Rauke, and so on ; dotted over the country iu every city from the Bal- 
tic to the Alps. 

Much might be expected from Switzerland, for it is the laud of the 
prehistoric lake-dwellers; and she has not disappointed our expecta- 
tions. Berne, the capital, has no less than three governmental prehis- 
toric museums; one, belonging to the republic, was purchased by it 
lately from Dr. Gross, of Neuveville, for the sum of 00,000 francs. The 
canton and the city each own a museum of no mean extent, where are 
gathered and displayed all objects found iu the neighborhood. The 
other cities and cantons of Switzerland are equally alive to the im- 
portance of this science and equally active iu its study and pursuit. 
Geneva, with Dr. Gosse at its head, Lausanne, with Morel-Fatio, Yver- 
don, Neuchatel, Bienville, Steen, Constance, Zurich, are all active, en- 
ergetic, and industrious in gathering the objects in their vicinity and 
in the general increase and diffusion of knowledge concerning their 
prehistoric ancestors and people. 

The same story may be told with regard to Italy. Genoa, Pisa, Turin, 
Milan, Verona, Vicenza, Parma, liegio, Bologna, Imola,Marzebotta, Flor- 
ence, Arrezzo, Cortona, Perugia, Chiusi, Corneto, all possess extensive 
museums, aud Rome has three or four great governmental establish- 
ments, organized with presidents and professors, and approaching the 
dignity of institutes and colleges, with museums attached, all devoted 
to the study of antiquities almost if not quite prehistoric. 



324 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

This list might be extended indefinitely. Austria, Hungary, Poland, 
Russia, are all interested iu this new science, and are devoting them- 
selves to the spread of its knowledge and to the increase of their 
museums. 

I have failed largely iu my purpose if before this time I have not 
convinced the reader that the United States, both government and peo- 
ple, have not been aroused to an appreciation of this new science, and 
have not attached to it the importance to which it is entitled and which 
it receives iu other countries. 

The International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Arch- 
aeology holds its tenth session in Paris during August (1889). These 
congresses were organized and have been holding their regular meet- 
ings since 1865 or 1867. They have had members, delegates, from all 
adjoining countries; they have usually met in the capital of the coun- 
try, and never twice consecutively in the same country, with a number 
of members varying from 500 to 1,500, according to the contiguity of 
the place of meeting. Their bulletins formed volumes of several hun- 
dred pages, that at Stockholm over a thousand, yet no scientific organ 
ization from the United States has ever had any representative, and 
since the meeting at Paris in 1878 there has not been a single American 
present, in any capacity, at any of the meetiugs. The same comparison, 
continued with regard to the means of instruction in the different 
couutries, America aud Europe, would make about the same showing. 
Each of the countries of Europe may, I think, fairly claim that they are 
equal to, if not ahead of, the United States iu their appreciation of aud 
assistance to the science of prehistoric anthropology ; even little Switz- 
erland, with a territory of 16,000 square miles, would say she was not 
behiud us. Frauce, with her area of 204,000 square miles, would un- 
doubtedly claim superiority over the United States. The area of the 
United States is greater by far than that of all Europe, aud its archae- 
ological area, acre for acre, is equally rich in specimens, and would 
afford a proportionate number and a proportionately good opportunity for 
the study of the history of the prehistoric man ; and yet, I repeat, every 
country in Europe, if it but knew the exact status in the United States, 
would claim that it was superior in interest and study of the scieuce of 
prehistoric anthropologj\ 

In the means of education in this new science the same comparison 
holds good between Europe and the United States. In the societies of 
the different countries, established for the advancement of science, a 
section is devoted to anthropology, as is done in the United States. 
But the ten different countries of Europe make ten different societies 
there against one in America. In Fiance, Germany, Italy, Denmark, 
Sweden, Scotland, and possibly in England, though 1 can not say cer- 
tainly, there have been courses of lectures organized and conducted iu 
connection with the societies of anthropology and the museums (such as 
comprise my department) in nearly all the principal cities. I may men-

t ion that of Paris as the most extensive and complete, yet the others 
are of no mean proportion. In Paris the organization comprises seven 
lecturers, and they provide one lecture each day during the entire col- 
lege session, from October until June, each being on the subject of an- 
thropology. The lecturers are paid for their services, and they carry 
on their work with an earnest diligence for which we can find no par- 
allel in the United States. The good effects of these lectures and of 
this education is manifest in the interest taken in the society, which 
numbers at Paris near seven hundred members, with an annual income 
of 20,000 or more francs, and with a capital of over 00,000 francs. 

Enlarging upon this question of the comparative want of interest on 
the part of the United States Government and people, I might remark 
the number of scientific missions which have been sent out by these 
European governments in pursuit of this science. lu 1884-85 France 
sent Dr. Poussie to Australia and India to make studies in ethnology, 
Le Bon to India to study primitive architecture, Jules Monsier to make 
archaeological researches in the Caucasus, Monsieur Bran to Malacca and 
Sumatra to make ethnologic collections, Gauthier to Turkey and Per- 
sia for researches in natural history and anthropology. Ernest Chan- 
tre, curator of the prehistoric museum at Lyons, was sent by the gov- 
ernment to make anthropological researches in the Caucasus. He has 
just published his report in five large volumes, quarto, with 440 figures 
and 140 chromo lithographic or heliographic full-page plates. M. 
Cartailhac was sent on a like mission to Spain and Portugal. His re- 
port is published in one large volume, with 450 engravings and four 
plates. The most extensive and complete works, with the finest illus- 
trations concerning our own country, do sometimes come from the 
hands of these foreigners thus sent out. Wiener reports Peru, Lucien 
Briart the Aztecs, while the most comprehensive work on the subject, 
entitled ''Prehistoric America," is written by a Frenchman, the Mar- 
quis Nadaillac. 

The curators of European museums are being continually sent to visit 
and examine other prehistoric museums than their own. In a report 
just received, published by the keeper of the National Museum of An- 
tiquities at Edinburgh, Dr. Anderson, and his assistant, Mr. Black, is 
to be found a note of some of these visits. "In connection with most of 
the principal archaeological museums on the Continent provision has 
been made for enabling the officers and attaches of the museum (who 
had been at their occupation as experts) to enlarge their knowledge in 
the lines of their specialties by travel and research." In 1842-45 Wor- 
saae was sent from Copenhagen through Sweden, Norway, North Ger- 
many, and Russia; in 1*40-47 to (heat Britain: and the result was the 
publication of his "Danes and Northmen in Britain," which is still the 
standard work. Mr. I'ndset, a young attache of the ( Mirisriania Museum, 
was sent to Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France, and Britain, as a result 
of which he published his Norse Antiquities. Since then he has traveled 



326 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

over Europe and published his report, "The Iron Age in Europe," the 
standard book on that subject. In 1878-'79 Dr. Sopbus Midler, a young 
attache of the Prehistoric Museum at Copenhagen, was sent through 
Germany, Austria, and Italy, returning through France and Britain. 
He studied the zooinorphic ornament in Europe, and he has published 
the most complete monograph on the subject which has yet appeared. 
Dr. Montelius, keeper of the National Museum at Stockholm, was sent 
throughout Europe to study the fibula of the bronze and iron ages. 
Sweden and Norway each set aside $560 annually for similar purposes. 
The report of Dr. Anderson, which I have just mentioned, was the result 
of sundry voyages made throughout Scotland, visiting the local archreo- 
logic museums, for the expenses of which an annual appropriation of $200 
has been made. 

The closer we examine and study the policy of the European govern- 
ments and compare their achievements and those of their people and 
institutions with those of the government and kindred institutions of 
the United States, the greater the contrast. Take the laws of the vari- 
ous European governments for the preservation of, by obtaining title to, 
mounds, earth-works, caves, dolmens, and other prehistoric monuments. 
The most of the European countries have passed such laws. In England 
Stonehenge belongs to the government, and Abury is now in the same 
line, if the transfer has not been actually completed. Denmark, Sweden, 
and Norway own great numbers of prehistoric monuments. In France 
they are to be counted by the hundreds, while Italy probably surpasses 
all others. In Italy these matters have received most serious considera- 
tion at the hands of the government, and a complete system of laws are 
now in force providing for the proper investigation of these monuments* 
their preservation, and the conservation of the objects found therein. 
Any person in the kingdom making a disco very of arch selogical objects is 
required to make it known to the proper department of the government 
at Rome. If he would excavate, he must also notify the Government, 
and it will send an inspector, who will supervise the excavation, keep a 
diary of all work done and a register of all objects found. This he does 
from actual observation, for he is required to be on the ground every day 
during the progress of the work. At Corneto-Tarquini the excavations 
have been continued practically for twelve years past by the same band 
of workmen under pay of the town, with a permanent Government in- 
spector. Antiquities discovered in Italy can not be removed from the 
Kingdom, certainly not from the Roman provinces, without first sub- 
mitting to the inspection of the Government officers, who claim the first 
right of purchase. Not until after they have declined to purchase will 
a permit be given for exportation. 

I do but state it fairly when I say that the United States, so far from 
having any such governmental control over or interest in any of the pre- 
historic antiquities, whether monuments or otherwise, has no serious 
thought of such control. Neither the Goverameut nor any of its officers 



DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY. 327 

or institutions have ever, to my knowledge, eveD considered a proposition 
for the purchase of any of these prehistoric monuments; and if they or 
any of them have ever supervised an excavation, it certainly has not been 
with a view to purchase the objects that they might be displayed in auy 
of the museums. By our law no officer or institution has either power 
or authority to purchase real estate, whether it be a prehistoric monu- 
ment or not. No such power has ever been proposed to be given by 
Congress, and we stand to-day in this position upon this subject, that the 
Smithsonian Institution, which may fairly claim to be the representative 
scientific institution of the Government, can not purchase any one of 
our numerous prehistoric monuments for the purpose of its preservation 
(as was done in the case of the Serpent Mound in Ohio) for want of the 
necessary legal authority. More than that, it can not accept and hold 
the title of any such monument, however great its value and necessity 
of preservation, even if such monument shall be presented as a gift.* 

I will not attempt to complete the comparison of labors performed 
and interest taken in the science of prehistoric anthropology between 
the two countries Europe and America. That will be known by 
American readers without citations. I make two remarks concerning 
American investigations and publications that, with a few exceptions, 
are easily recognized. The work has been done by piecemeal, a little 
here and a little there, devoted to a single locality or a single view of 
the subject, isolated, divided, without connection or harmony either in 
investigation, publication, or comparison, without any comprehensive 
or general system by which the workers, each performing his own 
labor, should assist. 

The duty of investigating prehistoric man in the United States clearly 
belongs to the scientists of our own country. It is the history of our 
own people and country, depending upon investigations made upon our 
own soil ; a studying, and, if need be, the excavatiou of monuments 
erected upon territory belonging to us. If it is to be done at all, it should 
be done by us. True, there is no law nor any legal obligation by which 
we can be required to make these investigations or perform this labor, 
and naught but national pride and our own sell' respect will compel 
it. We should apply'to science the Monroe doctrine of politics. We 
should recognize and declare our ability to do this work and our inten- 
tion to perform it, that we may contribute to the science of the world, 
a history of our prehistoric people. If the work is not done by us, or 
insufficiently performed, it should not be because the matter was neg- 
lected or forgotten liy either our Government or people, but for the rea- 
son that we decided it was not worth the effort, and in this we must jus- 
tify ourselves in the eyes of the world. The sciences of astronomy, 
chemistry, metallurgy zoology, and paleontology may have certain de- 
mands for recognition, but their claims rest upon other countries with 
equal weight as upon ours. Uur country is under no greater obligation

328 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, L889 



in respect of these and similar sciences than are other countries of the 
world. But in respect of tbe prehistoric anthropology of this coun- 
try it is different. The duty weighs heavier and solely upon us. 

The Smithsonian Institution and National Museum stand as beacon 
lights to the American people in respect to science, and are the great 
representative scientific institutions of our country. In this regard 
they represent the United States Government; they stand for it and 
speak for it. They have the ear of its Executive and of its legislature, 
and exercise an influence with the Government not possessed by pri- 
vate individuals or organizations, and therefore a certain responsibility 
rests upon them whether they will or nor. 

As a means of correcting the defect mentioned, 1 would respectfully 
suggest the giving of greater attention to the dissemination of informa- 
tion among the people. This can be done through publications, by 
means of lectures, and by the organization in kindred societies for con- 
cert of action and more extensive preparation at their meetings for the 
presentation of this subject in its proper light. 1 also suggest the 
preparation of series of specimens illustrating the science of Prehistoric 
Anthropology, accompanied with descriptive letter-press and catalogue; 
these to be distributed to all institutionsof learning in the United States, 
receiving in exchange such implements and objects as are possible. 
Perhaps the most important factor of all would be the endeavor to in- 
crease the knowledge and interest of the executive and legislative of- 
ficers of our Government, so that the science of Prehistoric Anthropol- 
ogy could be certain to receive in the future their countenance, support, 
and assistance. 

IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS DURING: THE YEAR. 

Dr. E. C. Black, Wheatland, Indiana, sent twenty leaf-shaped imple- 
ments from a cache or deposit. He states that they were found while 
plowing the side of a clay hill in an old field in Harrison Township, 
Knox County, Indiana. The laud had been in cultivation eighteen 
years, and its beiug a hill-side indicates that the implements were 
buried in the ground for a purpose. (Accession 2107G.) 

The Cincinnati Society of Natural History (through Horace P. Smith, 
108 Broadway, Cincinnati, Ohio), forwarded a collection from the cem- 
etery at Madisonville, Ohio, consisting of flint knife, drills and 
scrapers, rude and fine spear and arrow-points, chisel and gouges, per- 
forators, scrapers made from the leg-bones of deer (peculiar to Madi- 
sonville), bone beads and needles, animal teeth such as bear, beaver, 
porcupine, woodchuck, elk, lynx, and raccoon. Also perforated uuio 
valves, carbonized maize and ashes from altar mound number 3; 203 
specimens. (Accession 2120G.) 

C. T. Wiltheiss, Piqua, Ohio. Six flint Hakes and points, I perforator, 
17 rude implements more or less leaf-shaped (Hint), 14 disk-like imple- 
ments of slate (Plate V), 1 L polished stone hatchets, 2 grooved axes, 1

notched ax (granite), -'> pieces of slate rudely worked, and 2 unfinished 
ceremonial objects of slate; ">() specimens. 

Be says, ''The implements wash out of the cast bank of the Miami 
River, on the bottom-lands, from a stratum of yellow clay covered by a 
layer of black loam 8 or 1 feet in thickness." 

The thirteen disks are so well shown in the plate as to render descrip- 
tion useless, except to say that they are the same on both sides, are 
quite flat and thin. Their edges are not defined nor sharp enough for 
them to have served in their present condition as a cutting implement, 
and there is no trace of service by which their purpose (tan be surmised. 
One has a slight notch in its edge, but it appears to have been acci- 
dental. Others (not shown) are of different forms, one with a rude 
hammered or chipped edge, another with a rude notch indicating a 
possible handle, but the entire series is unusual. (Accession 20311.) 

G. B. Frazar (West Med ford, Massachusetts) sent a collection of 
hammers, paleolithic implements, arrow and spear points, knives, etc., 
found on the Mystic, in Medford, West Medford, and Arlington ; also at 
Spy Pond, Arlington, Massachusetts. This collection is quite interest- 
ing, and important from the fact that there were but very few speci- 
mens of the paleolithic class from Massachusetts in the Museum. (Ac- 
cession 21781.) 

Mr. P. L. Jouy, U. S. National Museum, contributed a collection from 
the prehistoric graves in Corea, in which are included stone daggers, 
arrow and spearheads, knives, chipped and polished hatchets, polished 
jade, Megatama or curved jewels, amber heads, and a polished stone 
ornament. These objects are rare and unique, and are the only speci- 
mens of prehistoric stone implements that have been received from 
Corea. They are a valuable contribution to prehistoric archaeology. 
(Plate VI.) (Accession 21859.) 

From W. D. Dreher, Knoxville, Tennessee, was received a grooved 
ax found between Loudon and Kingston, eastern Tennessee. This is 
one of the finest specimens ever received by the Museum. (Accession 
22057.) 

Mr. Warren K. Moorehead, Xenia, Ohio, forwarded a large and val- 
auble collection of prehistoric antiquities, mostly from the Ohio River 
Valley, for exhibition in the Museum. The collection deserves special 
mention. It is the result of years of work in the field, and when the 
specimens were obtained from other sources he has the exact locality 
where found given, so that the identity of each specimen is secured. 
It would be impossible to give a complete catalogue of the collection in 
this report, but it contains examples of almost every object known to 
American archaeologists in the localities which he has investigated. 
The objects from mounds are mounted separately. Each specimen is 
numbered, and Mr. Moorehead has a complete catalogue to which refer- 
ence can he made at any time; 4710 specimens. (Accession 21695.) 

The Musee d'Ethnologie, Geneva (through Dr. II. J. Gosse, director), 



330 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

sent a collection of Lacustrien pottery and bronzes, including vases, 
weights, etc., of clay; bronze bracelets, buttons, pins, rings, instru- 
ments, ear-rings, collars, fish-hooks, razor, hatchet, lance-head, sickles, 
knives, and pieces of wire. (Accession 28577.) 

From Halbert East (Jeffersonville, Indiana) was received a large col- 
lection of stone and bone implements, etc., embracing nuclei, paleo- 
lithic implements, notched axes, hammers, scrapers, perforators, airow 
or spear points, polished hatchets, grooved axes, pestles, fragments of 
pottery, bone implements, fragment of human skull, bones and teeth of 
animals, jaw-bones of drum fish, awls or needles made of fish-spines, 
fresh-water shells, and an encrinite bead; 756 specimens. (Accession 
21498.) 

He states that the largest number and most desirable of the speci- 
mens were found in a burial place near Clarksville, Indiana, evidently 
deposited with the bodies of the owners. Some were on the surface 
and at various depths below it. while others were taken from the graves 
or gathered on the slope of the shore line after heavy rains or high 
waters. I have never found a whole vessel of pottery or fragments 
larger than those sent. Many of the stone implements have been little 
changed from the stone as it was created, while others have been skill- 
fully wrought and smoothly finished. Nearly all the pieces of bone 
have been worked. The shells are part of such as I found quite plenti- 
fully with the human skeletons. 

Dr. F. A. Steinmeyer (Bonaparte, Van Buren County, Iowa), sent five 
paleolithic implements, which were found in the vicinity of Bonaparte 
at a depth ranging from 2 to 5 feet under the soil, which was clay. 
They were in their original position, and the deposit appeared to be 
accidental. (Accession 20684). 

Livingston Stone (Baird, California) sent two rude stone axes, which 
he says were formerly used by the Win-ni-mim Wintum Indians, 
McCloud River, California. They were — i. e., this kind of ax — in 
actual use among these Indians during the life-time of the older mem- 
bers of the tribe, and were the only axes used by them before the ad- 
vent of the white man 40 or 50 years ago. The larger one was em- 
ployed to cut down large trees, and the smaller one for brush and 
small trees. They are simply pieces of stone so cloven as to leave a 
comparatively sharp edge. (Accession 21035). 

One of the earliest, possibly the very earliest announced principle 
having a bearing upon the discovery of prehistoric man, was that by 
the three Scandinavian savants Nilson, Thomsou and Forchammer, in 
the early part of the nineteenth century, wherein they declared that 
rude implements belonged to an earlier civilization than those more 
highly finished. The ruder the implements, the greater their antiquity. 
It was in the application of this principle by these three wise men that 
the discovery of prehistoric man was made. I will not deny the cor- 
rectness of the principle — but it has been misapplied and misconstrued —

until 1 know of none which has beeu productive of greater error in the 
study of prehistoric civilization. Correct enough if applied to ;i whole 
people or to a series of their arts and industries, but it has beeu distorted 
by superficial investigators who apply it to a siugle object. These 
investigators passing upon an implement, especially one of stone 
and rude in construction, declare it to be of great antiquity, simply 
because it is rude, and this without regard to the locality in which 
it was found or the objects associated therewith. This has resulted in 
the propagation of great errors in regard to ancient civilization. If 
one wanted a common illustration of this error, let him consider tools of 
different trades — say carpenters, blacksmiths, tinners — and compare 
those used by workers in a complete establishment with those of a 
country workman who did only rough work. 

I am impelled to make these observations in studying these two rude 
stone axes received from Mr. Stone (Catalogue Nos. 139793, 139794). 
Only one, the largest, is illustrated ; from it one can easily understand 
what the smaller one is like. (Plate VII.) 

Now these implements were made with less work and in a shorter 
time than probably any other. They are of the extremest type of sim- 
plicity and rudeness, and yet they are probably the. most modern of any 
implement of similar type in the Museum. The one illustrated appears 
to have been a part of a large solid bowlder projecting from the earth 
with a worn and rounded edge at the top. A "heavy blow projected 
against the side of this rounded edge would knock off a large spawl, 
which became at once the completed ax. The rounded edge of the 
bowlder served for a grip, while the opposite side was the edge. It is 8 
inches long, Gi wide, and 2 thick, and weighs 4J pounds. Its material 
is diorite. The smaller one is 4 inches long, 2\ wide, 2 thick, and 
weighs one-half pound. Its material is indurated shale. Thus we 
have a veritable ax actually used for cutting trees so rude and simple 
as to be made at a single blow, and is withal quite modern. 

This implement, for all its rudeness, has no relation to paleolithic im- 
plements. The paleolithic age or period has sometimes beeu called the 
age of chipped stone, because its stone implements were made by chip- • 
ping, and in contradistinction of the neolithic age or period wherein 
most of the implements of stone were smoothed or polished. But these 
descriptions are only fortuitous. The term " paleolithic" in connection 
with prehistoric archaBOlogy means the ancient stone age; "neolithic" 
means the recent stone age, while the term "eolithic" has been given 
to the dawn of the stone age, said to belong to the tertiary geologic 
period. These prefixes eo, paleo, and neo are Greek, and refer to com- 
parative periods of time, and not to the implements, nor their kind or 
manner of making. While the principal implements of the paleolithic 
age were of stone, yet all were not so. Important implements of that 
age have been found in great numbers made of horn and bone. Bar- 



Oo'2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

poons, tish spears, all manner of points, needles, spoons, etc., were thus 
made, and they were all smoothed and polished; yet they belonged to the 
paleolithic age quite as much as did the rude chipped stone implements. 

The rude stone axes sent by Mr. Stone are not paleolithic, do not be- 
long to that age, and have no relation with or resemblance to any pale- 
olithic implements. They belong no more to the paleolithic age than 
would a split bowlder or piece of stone chipped to an edge by a hunter 
who, loaded and armed with all the scientific appliances of the nine- 
teenth century, having lost his hatchet, and being overtaken by night, 
should improvise and make such an implement to cut the needed brush 
for his fire or boughs for his bed. 

This implement, rude and simple as it is, has no resemblance to the 
true paleolithic implements — not in form, shape, mode of manufacture, 
kind of chipping, nor the formation or sharpening of its edge. Any one 
acquainted with them would recognize the difference at once and could 
not be deceived. 

From William Taylor (San Diego, Duval County, Texas) was re- 
ceived a rude flint implement, found near top of Equus beds, one-half 
mile from San Diego, where species of Mylodon, Glyptodon, and three 
species of Equus and Elephas have been found. (Accpsion 21181). 

From the U. S. Fish Commission (Washington, District of Colum- 
bia) was received archaeological specimens from Patagonia, Straits of 
Magellan, Lower California, and California, collected by the Fish Com- 
mission steamer Albatross duriug her voyage from Virginia to Cali- 
fornia in 1887-'88. 

The localities from which the specimens were obtained are as follows: 
Port Churruca, Elizabeth Island, Saint Martas Islaud,and Gregory Bay, 
Straits of Magellan, Pichilingue Bay, Gulf of California, Margarita 
Island, Lower California, and San Celmente Island, California. 

The greatest number of objects collected at any one point was at 
the Kitchen Midden, Elizabeth Island, Straits of Magellan. 

The stone implements of flint and obsidiau number four hundred and 
forty-five and include hammers, rude implements of paleolithic type, 
leaf-shaped implements, scrapers or knives, arrow and spear points, 
pitted stones, pebbles slightly worked, and a large number of chips and 
flakes. Bone implements were also found, such as perforators, knives, 
etc. The bones of animals and birds received have been identified as 
follows: Whale (species not identified), Sea Lion, Ota Ha jubata; Sea 
Bear, Arctocephalus; Penguin, two species, Aptenortytcs and Spheniscus; 
Cormorant, two species, Phalacrocorax xdbiventris; and Phalacrocorax 
magellanicus; Steamer Duck, Tachyeres cinereus and Gull, Larus. 

A large number of bones are in such a fragmentary condition that 
it is almost impossible to identify them with any degree of accuracy. 

The shells (426) belong to the following species : Patella, Mytilus, and 
Valuta. The specimens obtained at the other localities mentioned are 
perhaps of equal importance, and should, in the future, be made the 
subject of a more elaborate report. (Accession 21<>!>9.)

Thomas Wilson (U. S. National Museum) gave a collection of bone, 
stone, and shell implements, embracing hammers, rude pieces of worked 
dint, chips and flakes, leaf-shaped implements, scrapers, arrow-points, 
perforators of stone and bone, fragments of pottery, and valves of 
unios from Hahn's held, oue mile east of Newton, Anderson Township,

<J4 specimens. A rude chipped implement, found in the surface of an 
ancient cemetery at Sand .Ridge, Anderson Township, Ohio; five rude 
chipped implements, found 12 to 20 feet below the surface in the gravel 
drift of the Little Miami River, at Loveland, Clermont County, Ohio. 
(Accession 21238.) 

Also a large collection from Flint Ridge, Licking County, Ohio, con- 
sisting of flint cores, flakes, rude implements (so-called turtle-backs), 
small leaf-shaped implements, arrow and spear points, hammers, a rude 
maul, polished stone hatchets, notched implement, Hakes retouched 
with intent to deceive, and a number of specimens showing crystals; 
L029 specimens in all. (Accession 21351.) 

Mr. James C. Wright, of Fredonia, Licking County, Ohio, an enthusi- 
astic but careful collector of prehistoric arclneologic specimens, was 
reported to me as being the owner of a statue of a bear, found at the city 
of Newark. I wrote to him a letter of inquiry, and our correspondence 
resulted in the following letter: 

I send you by mail to-day a cast of the stone bear, as requested. It is owned by nie 
and has been in my possession ever since it was found. The stone bear was taken 
from a mound in the city of Newark, this county, in the year 1881, being found 4 feet 
below the surface, associated with human bones. There is no doubt of the genuiue- 
uess of this relic, as there are a number of persons who saw it at the time it was 
Ion ud. Mr. Jacob Holler, a day laborer, was the tinder, and I purchased it of him 
soon after. 

1 had heard of this find while on a visit to the city of Newark, and 
bad seen a cast. It was then called the stone bear, and was continually 
spoken of as such. Upon receipt of the cast T recognized at a single 
glance that it was not the statue of a bear, but intended to repre- 
sent a human form clad in bear's skin, the head being brought over the 
crown and serving as a sort of head dress, after the fashion of a lion's 
skin of Hercules and Alexander. In the illustration (Plate VTH), the 
photograph has been taken of the cast, showing front and profile views. 
1'lie subject has been conventionally treated, 'flic entire head of the 
bear is represented on the top of. the head of the man in such way as to 
show the entire skull of the bear and not the skin alone, while the arms 
of the m, m appear inserted within the skin of the fore legs of the bear, 
flic appropriation of the skin of the beast which had been slain by 
the hunter who had shun it, as a trophy of his skill and prowess, is a 
custom prevailing in all countries and ages, the beginning of which is 
lost in antiquity. Its survival into modern times and in civilized so- 
ciety is shown by the same use ol tin' brush of the fox, the scalp of the 



334 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

wolf, and the skin of the lion and tiger. It probably existed in prehis- 
toric times, and while no direct evidence has been found of such a cus- 
tom in the eastern hemisphere, the object herewith figured is evidence 
of its existence, and the use of the skin of the slain beast, either as a 
garment or a fetich, or both, among the prehistoric peoples of Amer- 
ica. The custom is found in the times of earliest given history. Her- 
cules stands in the Grecian mythology as the earliest and most notable 
representative of this custom. Hercules having slain his music teacher 
Linos, was banished by his putative father Amphytriton. At the age 
of eighteen he slew a lion that infested Mount Kythaeron and preyed 
upon the flocks of his father. Eeturning to Thebes he wore the lion's 
skin hanging from his shoulders as a sign of his success, and from this 
one may suppose that it was already a custom and that he was not the 
first to inaugurate it. But the skin with which Hercules is generally 
represented was not that of this lion. Of the twelve great labors put 
upon him by Eurystheus the first was the destruction of the Neinean 
lion. Its skin was known to be impenetrable, proof even against the 
arrows of Hercules. He entered the cave where was its lair, closed the 
entrance behind him, grappled the monster in his arms and strangled 
him. He tore off the skin and resolved to wear it in his own defense, 
and thus he came to be represented with the lion's skin, either carry- 
ing it across his arms or wearing it down his back, with the skin of its 
head fitting to his crown like a cap, and the fore legs knotted or crossed 
under his chin. 

The early coins give us some insight into this matter. Beginning 
with 700 B. C, the coins bore the type of the various animals — lion, 
bull, horse, boar, etc. — also the creatures of mythology, as the Chimera, 
Gorgon, etc., while they early began with types of the gods — Aphro- 
dite, Poseidon, Pegasus, Minotaur, Apollo, etc. Among these early ap- 
peared Hercules. On a coin from Termera, dating probably about 480 
B. C, Hercules is represented kneeling, with the lion skin about him and 
its head drawn over his crown. On two coins of Cyprus, Hercules is 
represented with his bow in his left hand, his club in his right, and 
wearing the lion skin. A coin of Thasos, about 411 B. C, represents 
Hercules in the act of drawing the bow and wearing the lion skin. In 
the foregoing the hero is represented at full length, and, consequently, 
the lion's skin is extremely small and somewhat indistinct. But on a 
coin from Camariua, which was destroyed 405 B. C, is the type of the 
head of young Hercules, which shows the lion's skin with great detail 
aud beauty. The fore paws are drawn together and crossed on his neck 
under the chin. The under jaw of this lion is conventionally treated, 
and is shown as laid upon the under jaw of the god, the lion's open 
mouth encircling his ear. 

A gold coin from Syracuse, about 412 B. C, shows the head of Her- 
cules again with the lion's skin, and others from Cos Cyprus aud other 
places, so that they cease to be rare.

Alexander the Great adopted the lion's skin head-dress, and in a large 
proportion of his coins, especially the tetradrachm, he is thus repre- 
sented. It was at that period and in this coinage that Hercules began 
to be represented with his club, his effigy being usually upon the re- 
verse, while on the obverse was depicted Alexander with the lion-skin. 

On some of* the coins, instead of the lion skin, Alexander is repre- 
sented with his head covered by the front portion of the skin of an ele- 
phant, showing the tusks; this was adopted, as is supposed by some, 
after his victories in India. 

It is probable that this object is unique in the locality in which it has 
been found. The Indians of that locality, and possibly all over North 
America, were in the habit of employing skins of beasts to cover them- 
selves, whether for protection against cold or enemies, but more prob- 
ably during their dances and ceremonies, in which they may have rep- 
resented the animal whose skin they wore. Numerous cases of this 
kind can be found. The buffalo dance among the Mandans is one of 
this kind. It is described in the Smithsonian Report, 1885, Part n, 
page 309. It is there said that this dance was to make the buffalo come 
when the Indians are likely to starve for want of food. Their song was 
to the Great Spirit, imploring him to send the buffalo, and promising to 
cook the best of it for him. 

It is not improbable that in this way the skins of various animals thus 
worn, and which in other countries served as the coat of arms of the 
individual or family and became the foundation of heraldry, here found 
their coun terpart in the different clans of various tribes, as the bear, the 
wolf, the fox, etc., or in other localities it may have served as the totem 
of the individual or his clan or tribe. 

It is to be remarked that the physiognomy of the individual isnotat 
all Indian. He holds in his right hand, as it were by the neck, the 
amputated head of another individual, which can be best seen by turn- 
ing the front view upside down, which brings that head into a natural 
position. The hair of this head is strained tight away from the head, 
and drawn together and held at the foot of the statue. The features of 
this head bear no greater resemblance to that of the Indian than does the 
first. There are also ear ornaments in both figures, which have a re- 
semblance to those from the farther south, Mexico and Central America, 
rather than to anything pertaining to tin; Indian. 

In fact, all the peculiarities of the human portions of this figure point 
to such a resemblance rather than to the North American Indian. 

Another floating straw of evidence in this direction is to be found in 
Figs. 1 and 2 of Plate IX. Fig. ! is a stone object, in form of the llama, 
and was brought from Teru by Mr. W. E. Curtis during his late visit 
to that country, the result of which he has just published. Fig. "2 is a 
cast of an objecf bearing a great resemblance to the llama, and in fact 
to nothing else, t he original of which is in the possession of I )r. Snyder, 
and which was found in a mound in Miama County, Ohio. It has been

known that the llama belongs to South America aud to the southern 
part of North America. Among the discoveries of Mr. Cushiug, in 
charge of the Hemenway expedition on the Saiado River, were rude pict- 
ures aud outlines of animals which can only be likened to the llama 
if they represented any living animal. Dr„ Washington Matthews has 
made an investigation into this matter, aud his report with these figures 
is in train for publication. It was, I believe, his opinion that no traces 
or evidence of the existence of the llama in North America farther 
north than the Saiado River had ever been found. It is not intended 
by these observations to make any assertion with regard to the truth 
of these matters, but only to offer them in the way of suggestion, as 
affording subject for consideration. (Accession 21794.) 

REVIEW OF SPECIAL RESEARCHES. 

The continuation of researches as to the existence aud frequency of 
occurrence of paleolithic implements in the United States has been 
continued, aud the department is still in receipt of letters from persons 
whose attention was called to the subject by Circular No. 3G. 

During the year 14 accessions, numbering in all 3031, were received 
in this department for examination and report. 

On December 10, 1888, a circular letter in regard to a rude ciiipped 
stoue ax or adze was sent to a large number of contributors to this 
department, and responses have been received from fifty-two persons, 
which will be given in a future report, when fuller information has been 
received. (Plate X.) 

The examination of steatite bowls, trays, and plates affords an inter- 
esting study. 

They have been investigated on the Pacific better than on the Atlantic 
slope, though some ardent, intelligent seekers have made discoveries 
which unfortunately have not been published. The most common form 
is oval, boat-shaped, with handle at the ends. They are blocked out 
rudely at the quarries and then carried away to be finished leisurely. 
The marks of pecking and cutting are shown in Fig. 1, Plate XI, as is the 
partly wrought handle at the end. This specimen is broken, as are 
nearly all found in the quarries. Fig. 2 is a rude notched ax, said to 
have been found in a quarry along with Figs. 3 and 4, all from Gooch- 
land County, Virginia, and presented by G. W. Reed. The latter are 
an adaptation of the common polished grooved stone ax (No. 4), being 
more pointed than usual. They were evidently to be used with a 
handle, and may have served to fashion either the inside or outside of the 
bowl. Figs. 2 and 3 may have been used in quarrying. These, with the 
many others of the same type and the numberless other industrial and 
art objects of the same culture, seem to fix the epoch of the steatite 
implements as neolithic and late Indian. The two implements, Figs. 
.">, Pennsylvania, (5 District of Columbia, have no groove, and probably 
were held in the, hand. Their points are peculiar, and with Fig. 4 may

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY 
IN THE l. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, L889. 



By William Tf. Holmes, Honorary Curator. 



Little work has been required in this section beyond the reception 
and installation of new accessions. The collections and additions for 
the year fall considerably short of those of preceding years. Through 
>ur official collectors, chiefly agents of the Bureau of Ethnology, 532 
specimens have been received. Through purchase we have 151, and 
through donation IV>~>. 

Among the more important collections are donations of pottery from 
^ mound near Lake Apopka, Florida, by Dr. Featherstonehaugh, and 
r>f pottery from a mound on Perdido Bay, Alabama, by Mr. F. H. Par- 
dons. The latter collection is one of the most important ever received 
from the Gulf coast. 

Researches connected with this section made by the curator were 
limited to a study of the pottery of the Potomac tidewater region. A 
paper upon this subject will appear in the July number of the American 
Anthropologist.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF FORESTRY COLLECTIONS 
IN THE l'. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



By B. E. Ferxow, Honorary Curator. 



The establishment in April of this year of a section of forestry col- 
lections in the National Museum is an event, significant in so far as it 
recognizes the existence of forestry as an art worthy of representation 
in a museum. I believe that there is no such special section to be 
found in any other great museum of the world, and my report may 
therefore properly consist in the justification of this new branch of 
museum work, a brief outline of what such forestry collections should 
contain, and how they are to be classified. 

Forestry is an art in the same sense as agriculture, and comprises 
all that part of human activity which concerns it sell" with the produc- 
tion of timber and the management of the artificial or natural forest as 
a crop, or for its beneficial influences upon other conditions of life. 

The basis of all forestry is of course the growth of trees. Yet its 
sphere must not be confounded or mixed up with that of the horticult- 
urist, or the orchardist, or the landscape gardener, who use trees for 
ornamental purposes or for their fruit. The aim as well as the methods 
of the forester are distinct from those of these other branches of arbori- 
culture, and the scope of forestry is as distinctive. 

Forestry may be said to be the latest art invented by human intelli- 
gence, and practiced only by fully civilized people with reference to 
the use of the soil ; and its development ami extent of application may 
be fairly considered as a measure, if not of the intellectual, yet, of the 
cultural development of a country. 

Willi the growth of population grow the demands on the products of 
the soil, and the most prolitable use of soils for the production of food 
and for other necessities — the relegation of the soil to proper uses — 
becomes the problem of a nation which lives and progresses intelli- 
gently. 

We find, therefore, in the most densely populated regions the cult- 
ural arts most highly developed; and in ;i country like Germany, it is 
only wise and providential policy with regard to flic use of the soil, 
which makes the subsistence of an ever-increasing population on a con- 

343 



344 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

fined and naturally not bverproductive area possible. Agriculture 
and forestry are practiced there on the most scientific methods. 

Besides the production of useful material for the arts, there has been 
more or less distinctly recognized from olden times, a certain connec- 
tion of forest growth with climatic, water, and soil conditions. Lately 
this assumed or observed connection has been subjected to scientific 
scrutiny, and while in some respects the claimed inttuences have not 
yet been quantitatively determined, or as in the case of the influence 
on rain-fall even qualitatively defined, yet the most advanced students 
of the question of forest influences are agreed upon the existence of 
certain mechanical influences which a forest cover may exercise upon 
the seasonal flow of water, upon local conditions of atmospheric 
and soil humidity, and upon all local and climatic hygienic conditions 
which are determined by the atmospheric movements in the lower 
strata, and upon which the mechanical barrier of a forest belt must 
natually bear. 

The forest, then, has an interest to man both for the valuable mate- 
rial it furnishes and for its bearing upon conditions of life hydrologic, 
climatic, cultural, hygienic, and ethical; this last influence is by no 
means to be underrated in the life of a nation. 

In our own country the recognition of the value of this natural re 
source, the forest, is only just dawning. We are only just realizing 
that under the clearing for agricultural laud, and under the drain for 
wood and lumber — which now represent an annual product valued at 
over one billion dollars — and under careless destruction by fire, and 
the absence of all application of the art of forestry, the natural forests 
are being decimated at a rapid rate; no regard being paid to future 
requirements, no regard to the disturbances which begin to make 
themselves felt here and there in water-flow, and to other conditions 
produced by the removal of their protecting cover. 

The tree-planting on the Western wind swept plains, scanty indeed 
when compared with the large area in need of such protection, is almost 
the only sign of intelligent appreciation of the value of forest growth. 
A begiuuing has been made to remedy matters, which in a country 
with our institutions, must consist mainly, in the first place, in educat- 
ing the masses. 

This educational work is carried on by associations, by the press, by 
the Forestry Division in the^ United States Department of Agriculture; 
and now the National Museum, which with its object lessons is the 
great educator of the people, joins these forces by making the subject 
of forestry a part of its exhibits. The reasons, then, for forestry ex- 
hibits and the justification of instituting a separate branch of forestry 
collections in the Museum are: 

(1) The importance and singleness of the art of forestry being sep- 
arate in its aims and methods from all other arts and industries: 



SECTION' OK FORESTRY COLLECTIONS. 345 

(L*) The absence of an appreciation of the value and character of 
forestry in our country, which calls for the education of the people; 

(3) The value of object lessons in educating - the people, which is the 
main function of the Museum. 

While other art exhibits of the Museum are more in the nature of a 
record of that which has been accomplished, and serve to show the 
progress of the art through the various stages of its development, and 
incidentally to serve the educational object of furthering general and 
special knowledge in the respective branches, I conceive the object'of 
forestry collections at present to be principally educational. Forestry, 
as an art, being hardly yet known in our country, the exhibits will have 
to lead up to the art by making known its aims and needs, and by 
facilitating an acquaintance with the objects upon which it is to be ex- 
ercised — the forest and its component parts; also by exhibiting the 
experiences and practices of other countries, in order to stimulate the 
application of the art in our own country. The sequence in which, 
therefore, the exhibits are to be secured, will have to be with reference 
to their educational value in the direction outlined. 

RANGE OF FORESTRY COLLECTIONS. 

To define and circumscribe the range within which forestry collec- 
tions ought to be kept, it will be well to find the fields on which it bor- 
ders, from which it borrows, and upon which it works. 

Other museums, like that at Kew, have a branch of economic botany; 
a part of this field must be occupied by forestry collections. Forest 
botany is a branch of economic botany, and forms naturally also an 
object of forestry collections; and such branches of physiological bot- 
any as apply to tree-growth belong also in its sphere of representation. 

Technology and chemistry, as far as these bear upon the application 
of wood in the arts, upon the derivation of by-products from wood, 
upon increasing the durability of wood-material, etc., come under the 
consideration of the forestry collector, only, however, in so far as they 
exhibit or influence the quality of the raw material, to produce which, 
the art of forestry is called into requisition. 

While the application of wood in all branches of human art would 
furnish an endless array of manufactured objects for exhibit, if seems 
expedient to make use of such exhibits in forestry collections, only so 
far as they illustrate the capability of the material for a certain class 
of manufactures. 

Machinery and engineering find application in the exercise of the 
art, and as far as they are used exclusively in the transformation of the 
raw material of the forest, in the production of the forest crop, or bear 
upon forestry work in general, they must find representation in forestry 
collections. 

With these limitations in mind, we may propose a preliminary classi- 
fication of exhibits under the following sections : 



346 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

A. Relation of forestry to other industries and conditions of life in 
general. 

' B. Description of the objects upon which forestry is to be applied 
and of the raw material. 

C. Methods of utilization and application. 

J). Methods of production and management. 

E. Bibliography and miscellaneous. 

Section A would serve, so to speak, as an introduction to the subject 
of forestry. Under it would be classified such exhibits as represent the 
importance of forests to the industrial and cultural life of the nation, 
their influence upon soil, water, and climatic conditions, and their eth- 
ical value, forest conditions of tbis and other countries, statistics of 
supply and demand. The value of the application of forestry upon the 
natural forest areas, the history of the development of the art in other 
nations and our own, methods of education, may be exhibited in statis- 
tical tables, charts, maps, etc. 

Section B would represent not only the nature of the material of 
which our forests are composed, describing the forest trees by botan- 
ical specimens, wood-sections, and illustrations (forest-botany), and 
more especially the economically valuable timbers by slabs and other- 
wise, but also by maps, charts, and illustrations, the distribution, loca- 
tion, and condition of forest-areas and the distribution of species (for- 
est geography). Photomicrographs and veneer sections will show the 
structure of the various woods; peculiarities of growth and character- 
istics of the living tree will be made clear by suitable specimens. 

The aim in this section will have to be not to expand too much in the 
direction of general botany, but to keep in view that forestry deals with 
vegetable products for a special purpose mainly, and this purpose must 
guide in the selection and limitation of the exhibit. 

The timbers of foreign countries may also be exhibited as far as their 
knowledge is of interest, as bearing upon the forestal development of 
our country, or as aiding to make us appreciate our own forest wealth. 

Section C admits of the greatest expansion, and the limitations 
above mentioned will have to be specially kept in view in selecting the 
material for exhibit. Besides the raw material in shape for manufact- 
ure and partly manufactured, there may be exhibited such complete 
manufactures as show the adaptability of certain woods to special uses. 

Here will also be exhibited the tools and machinery (in models, etc.) 
of the lumberman and the wood-worker, as far as they belong to the 
history of harvesting the crop and shaping it for the market. 

The methods of obtaining the so-called by-products of the forest, 
such as tan bark, turpentine, charcoal, and the various products of dis- 
tillation, also cellulose and wood-pulp manufacture; processes for sea- 
soning and preserving timber, etc., must be represented in this section. 

The exhibits for Section I) represent forestry proper, and, since for- 
estry is hardly yet practiced in this country, will at first have to be 



SECTION OF FORESTRY COLLECTION'S. 347 

largely composed of material obtained from foreign countries where 
the art of forestry is practised, representing the tools used in forest 
planting, the maps and plans used in forest management, graphic illus- 
trations of rates of growth, and the methods and instruments employed 
to measure them ; instruments used in thinning, pruning, and the re- 
sults of these operations on the growth. Methods of protecting agaiust 
insects, methods of reforestation as used to guard against landslides 
and torrents; a seed collection, specimens of plant material, a root 
herbarium belong also in this exhibit. 

Section E would contain whatever of passing interest and curiosity, 
not at present otherwise classified, may fall into the province of for- 
estry, and, further, such collection of reference literature, reports, maps, 
charts, photographs, as will aid the student to understand the relation 
of forests and forestry to human life, and show its history and develop- 
ment as an art. 

The short time since my appointment and other duties have prevented 
the installation of any exhibits, excepting one. This consists of a 
series of thirty pbotolithographs from the work of the French forest 
administration, illustrating the effects of deforestation in the Alpine 
districts of southeastern France, and the methods applied to counter- 
act the torrential action thus produced ; two statistical tables give in 
briefest manner an idea of the forestry interests of the United States; 
two half-sections of Sitka Spruce from the northwest (228 years old and 
7 feet in diameter) show the rapidity and immense dimensions of the 
growth in that section; while a historic chart adapted to a section of 
Tulip Poplar (5 feet in diameter) from the Mississippi Valley brings to 
the mind of the beholder by referring the annual ring-growth to his- 
torical data, the long periods of time which are required to produce our 
forest giants in the East and which form the basis of calculation in the 
art of the forester. The whole exhibit, placed on one panel 14 by 12 
feet, is designed to create in the mind of the visitor the first interest in 
the subject of forestry and in the forestry collections to come. 

The material on hand has not yet been classified, except superficially. 
It consists of parts of exhibits which have served in various exposi- 
tions, and, while forming a valuable nucleus for the collections, is far 
from being exhaustive in any one direction. Through the co-operation 
of the Department of Agriculture, and especially of its Forestry Divis- 
ion, it is hoped that the collections will soon be sufficiently ample to 
justify their installation. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS 
IX THE l'. S, NATIONAL MUSEUM, L889. 



By Frederick W. True, Curator. 



At the opening of the last fiscal year the preparations for the Ohio 
Valley Centennial Exposition, which had occupied the month of June, 
were nearly completed. A number of matters, however, still demanded 
attention, and the exposition work was not entirely off our hands until 
a month later. Early in the fall the Curator was called upon. to assist 
in the routine work of the Assistant Secretary's office. For this rea- 
son, and also because for a considerable part of the time the Chief Taxi- 
dermist was occupied by special work, outside of his regular duties, 
the progress made in the department during the year was not so great 
as it would have been under more favorable conditions. 

The exhibition series received more important additions than, per- 
haps, during any other year. The collection contains representatives 
of a larger number of families of mammals than ever before. A por- 
tion of these specimens were received in exchange, others were pur- 
chased, and the remainder originally formed a part of the series exhib- 
ited in the Cincinnati Exposition. 

The groups of prairie dogs and opossums, the first of a series in- 
tended to represent the smaller forms peculiar to North America, were 
placed in new, specially designed, cases. The series of easts of Ceta- 
ceans, which forms a special feature of the collection of the Museum, 
was renovated and completed. 

Attention was directed afresh to tin- matter of providing better 
storage-cases for the study-series. New arrangements were made 
necessary, especially by the fact that the Bureau of Economic Orni- 
thology and Mammalogy of the Department of Agriculture, had agreed 
to deposit in the Museum its valuable collection of North American 
mammals. The new cases are not completed at this date, but it is ex- 
pected that they will be in use within a few months. 

Among the accessions of the year are many interesting specimens. 
Two specimens of the rare Florida muskrat, Neofiber alleni, were pre- 
sented by William Wittfield, esq. Mr. Loren W.Green presented a 
series of excellent skins of the northern variety of Tamias utriatus, col- 

349 



350 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

iected at Charlestown, New Hampshire. A second specimen of Yes- 
pertilio longicrus was received from Judge J. G. Swan. Col. Cecil Clay 
obtained after much exertion, and presented to the Museum, the skin 
of a full-grown male moose. It is intended that this individual shall be 
included in the group of moose now in course of preparation. A small 
male deer, believed to be Cariacus gymnotus, was presented by the 
Philadelphia Zoological Society, through Dr. A. E. Brown. This is 
the third individual of this species received from the Society. 

Of exotic mammals the most important, so far as the exhibition 
series is concerned, were the monkeys and lemurs, twenty-nine in num- 
ber, purchased from Messrs. H. A. Ward, E. Gerrard, and Dr. J. Biitti- 
koper. The species were all new to the collection. Among the lemurs 
were several of the most important and most attractive species of 
Propithecas. A considerable collection of European bats, Vesperugo 
kuhlii, Vesperlilio nattereri, etc., were received from Dr. Senna Augelo 
in exchange for American species. 

From the Royal Zoological Museum, Florence, were received in 
exchange a skin of Ovis musimon, a skeleton of Monachus albiventer, 
and a number of European bats. 

Dr. Birt collected in Graytown, Nicaragua, a number of interesting 
specimens, including the Spiny rat, Echinomys semispinosus,a, form not 
hitherto obtained in Central America. It is a representative of the 
Octodontidce, a family usually considered strictly South American. 

Of aquatic mammals the most important accession during the year 
was a fresh male specimen of Sowerby's whale, Mesoplodon bidens, 
which was captured by the crew of the U. S. life-saving station at 
Atlantic City, New Jersey (Capt. J. L. Gaskell, keeper). This is the 
second specimen ever taken in American waters and the first fresh 
specimen ever seen by American naturalists. 

Among the collections made by the naturalists of the U. S. Fish 
Commission Steamer Albatross, during a cruise around Cape Horn, were 
a few South American mammals. The most important specimens re- 
ceived were the skeleton of a porpoise, Prodelphinus longirostris, obtained 
between Panama and the Galapagos Islands, and several skins of the 
sea-lions of the Galapagos Islauds. Two mounted skins of the West 
Indian seal, Monachus tropicalis, were received from Prof. H. A. Ward 
in exchange. 

As must necessarily be the case each year, the routine work which 
occupied the most time was the identification, cataloguing, and label- 
ing of accessions. A new card-catalogue was made of the skins which 
have accumulated in the tanks in the taxidermist's shop. When speci- 
mens are mounted or distributed the cards corresponding to them are 
removed from the catalogue, and it is always possible therefore to 
determine what material is really in the hands of the taxidermist. A 
large number of alcoholic specimens were measured preparatory to 
beiug converted Into dry skins, but for the reasons already given the 
taxidermists were unable to begin work upon them.

The matter of providing new storage-cases for the study-series was 
brought to a head by the otter on the part of the Bureau of Economic 
Ornithology and Mammalogy of the Department of Agriculture, to de- 
posit its collections of North American mammals in the Museum, if 
suitable cases for their reception were provided. It was finally decided 
to adopt metallic cases for the entire study series. Two large zinc-storage 
cases and a smaller tin case were obtained in Cambridge, Massachu- 
setts, tor trial. As a further experiment one compartment in the large 
storage base in the Osteological hall was liued with zinc and furnished 
with a dust-tight front, and one of the three-quarter unit tables in the 
south hall was also made dust-proof. These have proved very satisfac- 
tory during the short time that they have been in use, and the Curator 
has recommended that all the bases in the exhibition hall of the de- 
partment be remodeled in the same manner. The drawers in the large 
metal-lined compartment already referred to are four times as large as 
the ordinary unit drawers in general use in the Museum, and are admi- 
rably suited for the storage of large skins. 

Considerable attention has been paid to the matter of providing a 
substitute for the large tin-lined copper tanks which have hitherto been 
used for the storage of alcoholic specimens of large size. These tanks, 
besides being expensive, are constantly deteriorating, on account of 
the fact that the acetic acid and other impurities in the alcohol dissolve 
the tin linings and attack the copper walls of the tanks. As a result, 
the tanks soon begin to leak, and the hair aud bones of the specimens 
preserved in them are dyed green by the salts of copper in the alcohol. 
Inquiries have been made as to whether earthenware jars of suitable 
form and size could not be obtained in the market. Thus far, 
however, nothing suitable has been found, some of the jars offered 
being of too heavy weight, others too expensive, and others still coated 
with glazes which might be dissolved by alcohol. It will probably be 
found necessary to have jars manufactured, which shall be of a form 
and quality especially adapted for the uses of the Museum. 

A considerable amount of re-arrangement was made necessary in the 
exhibition hall after the ret urn of the collection exhibited in Cincinnati. 
The cases now in the hall are not sufficient for the exhibition of the 
entire collection, aud a small number of new ones are greatly needed. 
Special cases for the groups of opossums and prairie-dogs were made 
dining the year, ami the groups were placed in them. Temporary 
bases for Steller's sea-lion and the walrus were made prior to the 1th 
of March, in order to secure these specimens from injury at the hands 
of the crowds of visitors who were in the Museum at that date. A 
new case for the elephant "Mtingo" was placed in the hall, but has not 
yet been brought into use I regret t<» state that this ease was consid- 
erably injured by visitors on the 4th of March, in spite of the efforts 
• if the watchmen to protect it. Plans were made for arranging the 
collection of deers' antlers on the *>iers at the north end of the exhi-

bition hall, but after due consideration the scheme was abandoned on 
account of the expense involved. 

The series of cetacean casts, a considerable number of which had been 
more or less damaged by being moved from place to place and shipped 
to different exhibitions, was entirely renovated, and, except in the case 
of two large species, new casts were made from all the molds that had 
not previously been used. The series as thus completed consists of 
twenty-seven casts. Casts of the Grampus and of Sowerby's whale re- 
main to be added. It is intended that large painted labels shall be pro- 
vided for the series in the immediate future. 

As already stated, a large number of important species were added 
to the exhibition series during the year. No list of additions was given 
in last year's report, and the present one has, therefore, been made to 
cover the past two years.

As no statement of the character of exhibits prepared by this depart- 
ment for the Cincinnati exhibition was included in last year's report, it 
is perhaps, desirable that a brief account of the same should be given 
in this connection. After a number of plans had been considered, it 
was decided that a series representing all the existing families of mam- 
mals would be of more general interest, and would indicate more nearly 
the educational side of the work of the department, than any other 
collection which could be prepared in the time allotted. A number of 
families were unrepresented in the regular exhibition series of the 
Museum, but it was found possible to purchase representatives of 
many of them from the dealers in natural history specimens. A few 
were unrepresented, except by pictures. The real excellence of the 
collection as a whole is indicated by the fact that out of the eighty- 
eight families recognized, seventy-five were represented by from one 
to fourteen typical species. The whole number of mounted skins exhib- 
ited was one hundred and twenty-two, and of skeletons fifty-nine, 
making a total of one hundred and eighty one. Among these were 
some of the largest species, such as the fin-back whale, rhinoceros, 
elephant, tapir, gorilla, narwhal, walrus, black bear, etc. The Prong- 
horn antelope was represented by the admirable group executed by Mr. 
Hornaday, and now in the Museum. Specimens of two important forms, 
the Fur-seal and the Saiga antelope were loaned respectively by Prof. 
H. A. Ward and Dr. G. E. Manigault. The families of which repre- 
sentatives could not be obtained, such as those including the Ganges 
dolphin, the foussa, the giraffe, etc., were represented by pictures. 

The collection was installed in a special case 145 feet long, 3 feet 
wide, and 6 feet high (without the base), which was constructed in 
Washington and transported to Cincinnati for the exhibition. The rhi- 
noceros and the group of Prong-horn antelopes were placed in special 
cases, while the skeleton of the finback whale and the narwhal were, 
alter much labor, suspended from the roof of the building. The collec- 
tion was arranged by the Curator, who went to Cincinnati for that i>ur-

pose. He was assisted by Mr. W. Harvey Brown. All the specimens 
were labeled in the same manner as in the Museum, and the family- 
divisions were also indicated by large labels. At the request of the 
Director of the Museum, as pecial guide to the collection was furnished 
by the Curator, in which a brief account of the zoological affinities, 
habits, and geographical distribution of all the species was given. 

The Curator has completed during the year his preliminary examina- 
tion of the species of dolphins, and has read the proofs of a review of that 
group, forming Bulletin No. 36 of the Museum series. He has exam- 
ined all the species of Cariacus and Coassus in the collection, in the 
hope of finding trenchant characters whereby to distinguish these two 
groups of deer. In this connection he has prepared for publication a 
description of a new species of spike-horned deer from Central Amer- 
ica, Cariacus clavatus, a number of specimens of which were detected 
in the Museum collection. He has also prepared for publication an 
account of the collections of mammals made by Mr. Charles H. Townsend 
in Honduras, and by Doctor Birt in Nicaraugua. The former collection 
contained an undescribed subspecies of Cajrromys, C. brachyurus thora- 
caius, from Little Swan Island. 

The Curator furnished a greater or less amount of technical informa- 
tion on a variety of subjects, to a considerable number of correspondents 
of the Museum. He corresponded with A. H. Cocks, Esq., of Thames 
Bank, England, aud Mr. E. Pierce, of New Bedford, regardiug a har- 
poon of American manufacture taken from a whale captured on the 
coast of Finmarken. To Mr. C. L. Bichardson, of the Soldiers' Home, 
Kansas, he communicated such facts as are at command regarding 
breeds of solid-hoofed hogs. Mr. George H. Ragsdale, of Gainesville, 
Tex., received certain information regarding the mammals of that 
region, and Dr. B. W. Shufeldt, regarding the mammals of New Mexico. 

Correspondence was also had with Dr. W. L. Abbott, who has for- 
warded to the Museum a considerable collection of mammals made by 
himself in the vicinity of Mount Kilimanjaro, East Africa. 

The receipt of. a skull of a narwhal with two tusks, and of a fresh 
specimen of Sowerby's whale, was the occasion of an examination of the 
literature relating to those two species of whales. The facts regarding 
both were communicated to the Biological Society of Washington by 
the Curator. 

Dr. C. H. Merriam has made extensive studies of the arvicoline mice 
in the collection of the department, as well as of other groups of North 
American mammals. 

The general condition of the collection as regards preservation, may 
be considered on the whole satisfactory ; that of the exhibition series 
is entirely so. The mounted specimens have not suffered in the least 
from the attacks of insects for a number of years. The exhibition 
cases, if not absolutely dust-proof, are approximately so, and can un- 
doubtedly be made perfectly tight after a little more experimentation. 



DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 355 

The same, unfortunately, can not be said of the storage cases. As 
stated in previous reports they are neither sufficient in number nor 
satisfactory in kind. As arrangements have now been made, however, 
for providing better cases, it is unnecessary to repeat the previous 
recommendations regarding this very important matter. 

The condition of the collection of specimens in alcohol is fairly satis- 
factory. The specimens deteriorate to a certain extent in spite of our 
best efforts. For perfect preservation they should be placed in bottles 
which can be sealed with paraffine or wax. It is best that the collection 
should be reduced in size, but in order to convert a portion of the 
series into dry skins it would be necessary to divert the attention of the 
taxidermists from the work of mounting groups, which would be in- 
advisable. The skins might perhaps be made at the least expense by 
contract with outside parties. 

The number of specimens in the different series on June 30, 1889, 
was as follows : 

Number of mounted skins in the exhibition series 745 

Number of skins in the study and duplicate series 45">7 

Number of specimens in alcohol 3084 

Received during the year : 

Skins* - 192 

Specimens in alcohol 35 

Skeletons 44 

Skulls 151 

The first entry made in the catalogue of skins on duly 1, 1888, was 
under No. 1C,237; the last on July 30, 1880, was under No. 1G,870. 

In the catalogue of skeletons and skulls the first entry, July 1, 1888, 
was under No. 22,990; the last, No. 23,781. 

Of the mammals deposited by the Bureau of Economic Ornithology 
and Mammalogy, Department of Agriculture, the number of skins and 
alcoholic specimens entered was 382 ; of skulls, 358. 

* All the skins received during the year, one hundred and ninety-two iii number, 
were accompanied by skulls. The total number of skulls received therefore was 343. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS 
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889, 

By Robekt RlDGWAY, Curator. 



The year's work lias not differed materially in its character or scope 
from that of preceding years, except that the rearrangement, labeling, 
ami general improvement of the exhibition collection was more actively 
and continuously prosecuted. 

There has been an increase over the year 1887-'88 in the number of 
specimens received and distributed, in correspondence, and in the num- 
ber of specimens mounted. Owing to progress in the remodeling of 
the cases, a far greater amount of work has been done in the way of 
rearranging and labeling the exhibition collection. 

The number of entries made in the register of the bird department 
during the year is 2,971, the principal accessions being as follows: 

Auckland Museum, New Zealand, through I. F. Cheeseman. — One Apteryx oweni, 
one I'ii i)i tuts carneipes and apair of Hymenolaimus malacorhynchus, all from New Zea- 
land, tlic, latter species new to the Museum collection. (Exchanged.)

Besides some undescribed forms, the collection contaiusa number of very rare species 
represented in but few museums, as for instance Platalea minor, Herodias eulophotes, 
Lanius sphenoccrcus, Otis dyboivslcii, Ciconia boyciana, Puffinus leucomelas, Urosphena 
squamiceps, Xanthopygia xanthopygia, Erithacus sibilans, Galerida corensis, etc., and

360 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Routine work in arrangement and classification of tbe collection, and 
in the preparation of the exhibition and study series, has not differed 
materially in its character from that of the preceding year, but has 
been prosecuted on a much more extensive scale, owing to the greater 
facilities provided in the way of new cases, additional labels, etc. 

Specimens have been systematically arranged and labeled in twelve 
" door- screen " cases, two wall cases and adjoining sides of two adja. 
cent cases. These cases include the following exhibits : 

(1) Birds of literature (European) with appropriate special labels. 

(2) A corresponding series of North American birds, as yet unpro- 
vided with special labels. 

(3) A series of eggs, illustrating extremes of size, represented by a 
cast of the egg of the Giant ostrich of Madagascar on the one side, 
and the Humming bird on the other, connected by a series of eggs of 
different birds, including the ostrich, goose, domestic fowl, pigeon, etc., 
to show a gradation between the extremes. 

(4) The smallest known bird and its nest. 

(5) Specimens illustrating protective mimicry. 

(G) A selection of the more remarkable birds of the world (including 
the Lyre bird, Bell bird, Umbrella bird, Apteryx, Bird of Paradise, etc.). 

(7) The Great Auk and a cast of its egg. 

(8) A small collection explaining confusion of popular nomenclature 
in the case of certain American birds, to which have been applied names 
properly belonging to totally different European birds. 

(9) Parts of the general systematic or fauual exhibits, including the 
CorvidcEr, and the orders Picarice, Psittaci, Striges, Columbw, and Ptero- 
cletes of the general systematic series and the following families of 
North American birds: Thrushes, Warblers, Dippers, Creepers, Tit- 
mice and Nuthatches, Wrens, Mocking-Thrushes, Wagtails and Pipits, 
Wood-Warblers, Vireos, Honey Creepers, Shrikes, Waxwiugs, Tana- 
gers, and Finches. 

Among special researches prosecuted upon material belonging to the 
department may be mentioned, first, the work of a committee of the 
American Ornithologists' Union, having charge of the matter of the 
revised official check-list and supplement thereto. This committee 
held numerous meetings in the office of the Curator of the department, 
and based its decisions, affecting something near one hundred species 
and subspecies which were candidates for admission into the official 
list, almost exclusively upon the collection belonging to the depart- 
ment. In addition to this matter, special investigations were made by 
the curator in the genera Psittacula, Accipiter, Xiphocolaptes, and Scle- 
ruru8, while much work of similar character was done in connection 
with a large collection from Costa Rica, and a still more extensive one 
made by the naturalists of the U. S. S. Albatross in Alaska, and various 
portions of South America, including the Galapagos archipelago. Dr. 
Leonliard Stejueger has continued his researches in Japanese orni-

thology, while Mr. J. A. Allen, of New York City, Dr. P.L. Sclater, and 
Mi. Osbert Salvin, of London, England, Count von Berlepscb, of 
Miinden, Germany, and several other active workers, have been sent 
many specimens to aid them in their studies of particular groups of 
American birds. 

The present state of the collection is, so far as preservation of the 
specimens is concerned, as nearly perfect as is possible under existing 
circumstances, but a portion of the duplicate series and the mounted 
collection is yet liable to the attacks of insects, an unfortunate con- 
dition of affairs which it is not possible to prevent until suitable cabi- 
nets are provided for the former and the cases containing the latter 
made practically air-tight or dust-proof. So far as its arrangement is 
concerned, the condition of the skin collection (which is several times 
more extensive and valuable than the mounted collection) is extremely 
unsatisfactory. Not only are all the cabinets so crowded as in many 
cases to admit no additional specimens, but the general facilities for 
storage and proper arrangement are so inadequate as to prevent easy 
access to the specimens for study, and practically put a stop to the 
making of exchauges or distribution of duplicates. Indeed, it may 
truly be said that no other need of the department of birds can be 
compared in importance or urgency with that of suitable cases for the 
skin collection. 

The number of specimens in the bird collection at the end of June, 
18S9, can be only approximately stated, but the following careful 
estimate is believed to be very nearly correct.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF BIRDS' EGGS 
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 1889. 



By Charles E. Bendire, U. S. A., Honorary Curator. 



The following important additions have been made to the Oologieal 
collection during the year : 

From Dr. William C. Avery, Greensborough, Alabama. (Gift.) Nest and four eggs 
of Peucaia aestivalis bachmanii. 

From William W. Price, Tombstone, Arizona. (Gift.) Four eggs of CardeUina 
rubrifrous. New to tbe collection and to science. 

From J. C. Davidson, Lockport, New York. (Gift.) Nest and three eggs of Den- 
droica ccerulea. New to the collection. 

From Denis Gale, Gold Hill, Boulder County, Colorado. (Gift.) An exceedingly 
valuable and interesting collection of nests and eggs, among them those of Ptctco- 
rous columbianu8, Myadestes townsendii, Dendroica auduboni, Begulus calendula, Tardus 
aonalaschbcB auduboni, and Empidonax hammondi. This is the finest collection received 
for some time from any source. 

From the U. S. Fish Commission. (Gift.) An interesting collection of eggs, made 
during the cruise of the U. S. steamer Albatross, from December, 1887, to April, 1888 
in the Galapagos Archipelago and coast of Brazil. 

Fifty-three nests have been received during the year, of which some 
of the rarer species have been mentioned. 

The character of the routine work for the fiscal year has been as fol- 
lows : 

Taking the measurements, numbering, classifying, and arranging 309 
new specimens; relabeling and arranging part of the reserve collection 
of eggs after the new American Ornithologists' Union check list, be- 
sides arranging a series of foreign eggs, of which there are 4,193 speci- 
mens.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES 
IN THE U, S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



By LEONHARD Stkjneger, Acting Curator. 



Up to the time when the present Curator was appointed and assumed 
control of the department, the work performed during the year con- 
sisted chiefly in the ordinary routine. Upon assuming his new duties he 
found that before any other work could be properly undertaken, a 
thorough overhauling of the entire collection would be necessary, in 
order to ascertain just what specimens the collection contained, and to 
arrange them — so far as the space alloted to the department would 
allow — in such a manner that it would be possible at any time to lay 
hand on any specimen desired. A beginning was made with the re- 
serve series of North American species, and this work was still pro- 
gressing at the end of the year covered by this report. At the same 
time a large number of specimens, which previously had not been cata- 
logued, were entered upon the Museum register. 

The most important accession received during the year is the collec- 
tion made by the naturalists of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer 
Albatross, during the circumnavigation of South America, and particu- 
larly during the stay at the Galapagos Islands. The collection con- 
tains three hundred and nineteen specimens, which have been sent to 
Prof. E. D. Cope, in Philadelphia, for special report. 

From Mr. J. F. Le Baron, in charge of the survey of the proposed 
canal through the Isthmus of Nicaragua, an interesting collection of 
forty-four specimens, brought together by Dr. L. F. H. Birt, the surgeon 
of the surveying party, was received in good condition. The Curator, by 
press of routine work, was prevented from working it up immediately, 
but he hopes to be able to report more fully upon it later on. 

The Royal Zoological Museum, of Florence, Italy, sent in exchange a 
small but very interesting collection from that county, especially from 
the islands surrounding it. 

Mr. H. W. Henshaw, of the Bureau of Ethnology, presented quite a 
number of specimens, chietlybatrachians, from the eastern United States, 
among which were numerous specimens of Chorophilm triseriatus cor- 
poralU. 

365 



366 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Through the kind offices of Mr. Gustave Kohn, of New Orleans, Lou- 
isiana, the department secured by purchase, a number of rare chelon- 
ians from that state, thus filling serious gaps in the North American 
reserve series. 

A great deal of the routine work has consisted in entering on the 
record book material accumulated during previous years. The Curator 
has instituted a change in cataloguing accessions, so that now each 
specimen receives a separate number. Formerly all the specimens of 
the same species in each accession were entered collectively under the 
same number. Under the old system it was very difficult to properly 
designate each individual specimen when it became necessary to men- 
tion it separately, either in treating of it scientifically or in the ordi- 
nary museum routine, for instance, when any single individual of a 
collective number had to be picked out as a duplicate for exchange. 

Special care has been exercised in identifying and properly labeling 
type specimens. When assuming control the Curator found quite a 
number of specimens collected by the famous "Exploring Expedition" 
with labels which, from exposure and neglect, had become nearly illeg- 
ible. They had not been entered upon the record books, and on cat. 
aloguing them, great care was taken in deciphering the labels to prevent 
possible mistakes. This work was of necessity very slow, as it involved 
considerable research besides the mere deciphering of the faded labels ; 
but the Curator was rewarded by rescuing in this way the types of no 
less than eight species. 

It often happens that specimens destined for this department are 
received alive. Whenever practicable such specimens have been 
deposited in the department of living animals, to be returned when 
they die. It has been found impracticable to do so with rare or specially 
valuable specimens, because in the vivarium they easily lose their 
identity, while, on the other hand, it often happens that their death is 
only discovered after putrefaction has set in, rendering them unfit for 
preservation in alcohol. 

During the present year Prof. E. D. Cope has finished his work on 
the North American batrachians, based upon the collections of this 
department, and has commenced a similar study of the North Ameri- 
can snakes in the Museum. 

Dr. G. Baur, of Yale College, New Haven, Connecticut, has had for 
study a number of chelonians belonging to the Museum, especially the 
soft-shelled turtles. Some of the results of these studies will be found 
indicated in the bibliography of the year, forming Section IV of the 
report. 

The Curator has been unable to devote much time to scientific study 
of the collection during the few months he has been in charge. What 
little he has been able to do has been to investigate the status of the 
boiform snakes of North America! with special reference to individual 
variation. One paper has been handed in to the editor of the Museum

" Proceedings," while another more extensive article was in prepara- 
tion at the end of the year covered by this report. 

As stated above, a complete overhauling of the whole collection has 
been commenced and is still in progress, in order to ascertain the state 
of the collection, including the number of specimens contained in the 
various "series." On account of the cramped condition of the collec- 
tion and lack of assistance, this work will still consume months before 
completion. The following table is therefore simply based upon the one 
furnished by my predecessor for the year 1887-'88, by adding the num- 
ber of entries catalogued during the present year and deducting the 
number of specimens which are known to have been destroyed, or dis- 
posed of in exchange. By a calculation of this nature, the status of the 
collection on June 30, 1889, would be as follows : 

Specimens. 

Reserve series 13, 469 

Duplicate series 8, 802 

Unassorted and exotics 6, 134 

Total 28,405 

The state of preservation of the collection may be said, on the whole, 
to be tolerably good, but errors in numbering and labeling are con- 
stantly discovered. In most cases it has been possible to correct them 
by a diligent search through the records and the literature, a work in- 
volving considerable labor and consuming much time, though the re- 
sults have well paid for the trouble. The greatest need of the collec- 
tion, however, is additional room, since the great majority of the speci- 
mens with the present facilities are wholly inacessible, while the hand- 
ling of those more or less accessible is attended with difficulty, and ex- 
poses them to great danger of being destroyed or lost. The office of 
the department is now so crowded that a great many of the largest and 
most valuable specimens have to be placed on the floor, leaving but lit- 
tle room for the occupants to move about, and exposing the jars to the 
danger of being broken. 

The number of the last catalogue entry in June, 1S88, was 14,739; 
in June, 18S9, 15,523. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHES 
IN THE U. S, NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



By Tari.f.tox II. Bean, Honorary Curator, 



It having' been necessary for me to be absent from the Museum dur- 
ing July, August, September, and October, on duty connected with the 
U. S. Fish Commission, the department was, during those months, left 
in charge of my assistant, Mr. Barton A. Bean, who received and cared 
for the specimens sent to the Museum. He also overhauled the entire 
collections of fishes. Considerable time was spent in the arrangement 
of papers relating to fishes. Upon my return to Washington, I was 
occupied for a time with accumulated correspondence, accessions, etc., 
which had come in during my absence. Soon after this T was put in 
charge of the editorial work of the Fish Commission, which left me but 
little time to devote to Museum work. During the last six months of 
the year I prepared and had published in various journals numerous 
papers upon the Salmonidce and other species of fishes. A list of these 
papers is given in Section iv of this report. Fifty-three accessions 
were received during the year, of which the following are the most 
important : 

Accession 20952, containing eighteen new species of fishes, collected in the Gulf of 
California, by O. P. Jenkins and B. W. Evermann. The descriptions of these have 
been published in the Proceedings U. S. National Museum, 1888. 

Accession 21065, containing sixty-seven species of fish from northern seas; given in 
exchange by the Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen. 

Accession 21074, fort3 T -oue species of New Zealand fishes; in exchange, Otago Uni- 
versity Museum, Dunedin, New Zealand. 

Accession 21228, a collection of fishes from all parts of the world, including Eu- 
rope, tlir Pacific Ocean, North, Central, and South America; in exchange, Museum 
of Comp. Zool., Cambridge, IU;iss. 

Accession 21285, nine new species of fishes, collected in Virginia and North Caro- 
lina, by Prof. I>. S. Jordan ami party. A paper containing descriptions of these new 
forms lias been published in tin- Proceedings U. 8. National Museum. 

Accession 21302, a specimen of Merlucins bilinearis, collected at Point 1'leasant, 
New Jersey, by Capt. John G. W. Havens, and interesting on account of its range. 

Accession 21463, a collection of fishes made in Nicaragua, Central America, by Dr. 
Louis F. II. Birt. 

H. Mis. 224, pt. 2 24. 3GU 



370 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1880. 

Accession 21620, a large collection from the Mediterranean ; exchange from Royal 
Zoological Museum, Florence, Italy. 

Accession 21651, a collection of fishes, principally Selachians, from Australia; ex- 
change from the Australian Museum, Sidney. 

Accession 21752, types of new species, Gobius townsendi and Lepidogobius gilberti, 
collected at San Diego, California, hy C. H. Eigenmann. 

Large arid valuable collections have been received from the U. S. 
Fish Commission, made by Prof. D. S. Jordan and party in Virginia, 
North Carolina, and Tennessee. 

The routine work has consisted, for the most part, in receiving and 
caring for accessions, preparing papers for publication, attending to 
correspondence, bottling, labeling, and preserving the collections. 
Some attention has been shown students of ichthyology from this and 
other cities. The duties of the Curator, as Ichthyologist and Editor 
of the Fish Commission, have been such as to allow little time for Mu- 
seum work during this year. 

Exchanges have been made with the Otago University, New Zealand, 
and the Australian Museum, Sydney. 

The state of the collection has been improved; numbers of specimens 
have been transferred from tanks to jars, thereby insuring their better 
preservation. 

The number of specimens added to this department during the year 
was about G,000. There are at least 25,000 duplicate specimens, 60,000 
reserve specimens, and 30,000 specimens in the exhibition series. A 
collection of this magnitude is very difficult to handle and care for. 
The case and shelf room is inadequate, making it necessary to stand 
the jars containing the specimens upon the floor, thereby causing much 
extra labor and confusion. 



REPORT OX THE DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS* 
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



By Wm. II. Dai, i.. Honorary Curator. 



The force of the Department of Mollusks for the period reported on 
has consisted, in addition to the Curator, of Dr. li. E. C. Stearns, Ad- 
junct Curator, and Mr. Pierre Louis Jouy, Aid. 

Assistance in the work on the fossils collected by the Geological Sur- 
vey and otLer donors has been rendered from time to time by Messrs. 
Frank Burns and Charles B. Greene, of the U. S. Geological Survey, 
by the permission of the Director of the Survey. 

The need of the department for a person who might be entitled to the 
designation of an elegant penman, to write labels for exhibition and 
other purposes, increases annually. The clerical force of the depart- 
ment is wholly inadequate to conquer the arrears of labeling and regis- 
tration, a fact which will not seem extraordinary when it is realized 
that the collection contains at least twice as many specimens as any 
other department of thi Museum, that of these not exceeding one-half 
are registered and labeled according to the Museum requirements, and 
that at any time we arc liable to receive an accession large enough to 
employ our entire time for a whole year. 

The work, as in previous years, has consisted largely of the labeling, 
determination, and registration of new and old material. This branch 
of our work, owing to greater demands on our time from other direc- 
tions, has not progressed as tar as in the previous year. Still, under the 
circumstances, I believe that as much has been done as our opportuni- 
ties would allow, and it has been done in a thorough and efficient man- 
ner. A considerable amount of time has been spent in putting in order 
the Lea collection of Unionidce for exhibition. Seven cases have been 
arranged, but the work has been brought to a temporary cessation pend- 
ing the substitution of new and more presentable cases for those hith- 
erto in use. It is hoped that early in the present summer these may be 
far enough advanced to permit of arranging the whole of this unequaled 
collection of fresh-water mussels of the world. 

371 



Including tertiary fossils, 



372 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Good progress has also been made in cleaning and assorting the fos- 
sils contained in the Lea collection, mostly hue specimens from the Eu- 
ropean Tertiaries. 

ACCESSIONS DURING THE YEAR. 

The total number of accessions during the year is forty-six, a number 
somewhat less than the preceding year. The amount of material re- 
ceived under the head of these accessions is also less. It would have 
been wonderful had it been otherwise, since last year's list included the 
sixty-three boxes of the Lea collection. 

The most important accession of the year was the collection of 
Mollusca and Tertiary fossils made by the U. S. Fish Commission 
party on tke Albatross during the voyage from Chesapeake Bay, through 
the western Atlantic, the Strait of Magellan, and the eastern Pacific 
to the Galapagos Islands and San Francisco, California. This contains 
a small but precious collection of deep-sea forms, and a large number of 
shallow- water species of the coasts visited. The latter were particu- 
larly important on the eastern coast of South America, where the dis- 
tribution of the Mollusca is little known. The Albatross collections 
show that some of the Patagonian species reach as far north as the 
Amazon, and that some of the Antillean species extend southward to 
Eio Janeiro and even farther south. A special report on this collection 
is being prepared for the U. S. Commissioner of Fisheries. 

The accession next in importance was received from Messrs. F. B. 
and J. D. McGuire, of Washington, who presented on behalf of the 
heirs of the late J. C. McGuire, of Washington, a collection estimated 
to comprise about two thousand species and perhaps five thousand 
specimens of shells, marine and terrestrial, from various parts of the 
world. This generous donation has been retained temporarily in the 
packages in which it was received until the material now in hand shall 
have been administered upon ; but, when time shall favor, it will doubt- 
less add materially to our series. 

An invaluable faunal collection was received from the Auckland Mu- 
seum, Auckland, New Zealand, and containsaboutthree hundred species, 
with exact labels of locality, mostly named. These, with the very full 
collection received in former years from the Otago Museum, and other 
material derived directly or indirectly from private collections, makes 
the New Zealand collection of our department extremely full and nearly 
exhaustive for the marine forms. Our chief deficiencies from a faunal 
standpoint are, and have for some years been, among the African and 
Chinese forms and those of southern Japan. 

Among the smaller collections received, which are worthy of partic- 
ular remark, are a small collection from our constant friend and corre- 
spondent, Henry Hemphill, representing a picked series of certain Cali- 
foruian species ; a small lot containing some very nice things from Cape 
Sable, Florida, from Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. Navy, and two series each. 



DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS. 373 

from Messrs. G. W. Webster and J. J. White, collected in southeastern 
Florida. These materially enlarge our knowledge of the geographical 
distribution of many Southern species heretofore only known from the 
Antilles and the Keys. 

Among fossils the largest contributor, as usual, has been the U. S. 
Geological Survey, closely followed by Mr. Joseph Willcox, of Phila- 
delphia, whose energy iu exploring the fossiliferous deposits of Flor- 
ida has been most untiring. 

ROUTINE WORK. 

The routine work of the past year has been largely devoted to the 
collection representing the fauna of the southeastern shores of the 
United States and adjacent waters. This part of the collection is now 
wholly registered, fully labeled, and arranged systematically. A check- 
list of this fauna is now in process of printing, and when completed 
will serve as an index to this part of our molluscan collection. From 
a rough estimate this fauna may be regarded as represented in our col- 
lection by about fifteen thousand specimens divided among some two 
thousand nominal species. This is probably the fullest and best ex- 
hibit of these forms brought together anywhere in the world, though 
the very completeness of the arrangement shows that it is not without 
its deficiencies. 

Dr. Stearns reports that his time has been largely devoted to the land 
and freshwater shells, especially of North America, and to the revision 
and labeling of material heretofore not administered upon. The collec- 
tion of North American land and fresh-water shells is in complete order 
for reference, and the forms belonging to the South American and An- 
tillean fauna are to a great extent available also. The material in both 
these sections of the collection, as well as in the matter of exotic land 
shells, will be largely augmented when the Lea collection shall be ad- 
ministered upon and in a state for study. Constant small additions 
are being made by correspondents of the Museum in different parts of 
the country. 

As soon as storage room in the new cases becomes available, a large 
proportion of the material now piled up for want of space to put it 
away will be provided for, and work on the remaining arrears be greatly 
facilitated. A proper series for exhibition purposes will be available 
at the same time, and for the first time in its history the Department 
of Mollusks will be able to bear its proper share in interesting the pub- 
lic by the contents of suitable table-cases. 

Information or assistance of more or less importance, chiefly in the 
identification of specimens or supplying data for investigators, has 
been furnished to the following persons, among others, the work often 
requiring in a single instance the available part of several days of 
labor and the writing of several letters.

The limited time for research has been employed by the Curator 
partly in concluding the investigation of the mollusca of the expedi- 
tion on the U. S. S. Blake, under the supervision of Professor Agassiz, 
in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. The second and conclud- 
ing part of this report, including the Gastropoda and Scaphapoda, is 
now printed and forms a volume of about 800 pages with thirty-one 
plates. Work has also been done on the dredgings of the U. S. Fish 
Commission in the same region, and on the voyage of the Albatross to 
California, a report of which is nearly finished. A new systematic ar- 
rangement of the bivalve shells or pelecypoda has occupied the Cura- 
tor's attention, and the correlation of the Tertiary, especially the Plio- 
cene, fossils of our southeastern Atlantic coast, with the recent fauna 
of that coast, is in progress, with a prospect of publication during the 
coming year. Dr. Stearns has prepared for publication a paper, which 
is now in press, on Shell Money, Prehistoric and Historic,* a subject 
upon which he has made long-continued investigations. 

STATE OF THE COLLECTION. 

In previous reports I have stated why it is impossible to give the 
exact number of specimens, species, duplicates, etc., contained in the 
collection. In my last report I estimated that the collection contained 
455,000 specimens of all sorts. Since then about 13,000 have been 
received. 

The total number of entries in the Museum register, or catalogue for 
1887-'88, was 11,803; the number for 1888-'89 is 6,323. The discrep- 
ancy is entirely accounted for by the interruptions to our work already

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS 
IN THE U, S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, L889. 



By C. V. Riley, Honorary Curator. 



The past fiscal year has been rather a busier one than usual in this 
department, and has been signalized particularly by the preparation of 
exhibit collections. During the early part of the year the educational 
collection for exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposition was completed 
and sent to Cincinnati, where it remained until December. 

In August the Assistant Curator was sent North, and examined a 
number of private collections at New York City, Brooklyn, Albany, 
Brockport, and Buffalo for the purpose of obtaining exchange material 
for the Museum. During October and November, work upon a general 
exhibit collection to be permanently placed on the lower floor of the 
Museum, was begun and carried on. In December, work on additional 
laboratory space was begun, and was completed in May. A large ad- 
ditional room has thus been added to the much needed conveniences of 
the department. During December work was also begun upon an ex- 
hibit collection devoted mainly to the economic aspects of eutomology 
to be sent to Paris, as a part of the exhibit at the Exposition. As 
additional help was needed upon this work, Mr. Martin L. Linell, of 
Brooklyn, was engaged temporarily for this purpose. The work of pre- 
paring this exhibit continued assiduously to the end of March, when it 
was shipped to Paris. 

April 1 the Assistant Curator, Mr. John B. Smith, resigned, to accept 
the more lucrative position of entomologist of the Agricultural Experi- 
ment Station at New Brunswick, N. J., and Mr. M. L. Linell was ap- 
pointed Aid. 

On April I went to Paris as one of the expert Commissioners, and as 
representative of the Secretary of Agriculture to the Paris Exposition, 
and during my absence of live months in those capacities Mr. L. O. 
Howard was Acting Curator, and I would here acknowledge my indebt- 
edness to him in that connection. 

The number of accessions during the year have been about as usual, 

but the following more important ones may be mentioned : 

377 



378 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

A series of named Coleoptera and Lepidoptera from Charles Drury, of Cincinnati, 
Ohio. This lot contains a large lot of species wanting in the collection. A consider- 
able lot of good material in Lepidoptera, collected in California by D. W. Coquillett, 
-was turned over to the Museum by Professor Riley, from the Department of Agri- 
culture. Ace. 21256. 

Twenty-nine specimens of 16 species of Mexican Coleoptera, collected at Guerrero, 
Mexico, and purchased from L. E. Ricksecker, Santa Rosa, California. Ace. 21347. 

Miscellaneous lot of alcoholic insects, collected by Walter B. Barrows at Concep- 
cion del Uruguay, Argentine Republic, South America. Ace. 21385. 

Collection of insects, chiefly Coleoptera, mostly from Michigan and Louisiana 
(about 1,200 species and 5,500 specimens), purchased by the Department of Agricult- 
ure from Mr. Tyler Townsend, and turned over to the Museum by Professor Riley. 
Ace. 21391. 

A series of 5 species of 30 specimens, of Lepidoptera, from David Bruce, Brock- 
port, Monroe County, New York. All desiderata. Ace. 21389. 

Miscellaneous lot of insects, from R. P. Speer, Ames, Iowa. Ace. 21464. 

A series of Coleoptera in alcohol, from E. Van Dyke, Los Angeles, California. Ace. 
21557. 

A miscellaneous lot of insects, mostly Coleoptera, from J. M. lloltzinger, Winona, 
Minuesota. Ace. 21542. 

A series of named Coleoptera, from Mr. Henry Ulke, of Washington, District of 
Columbia. Ace. 21670. 

A series of alcoholic specimens from Japan, from Mr. Romyn Hitchcock, U. S. Na- 
tional Museum. Ace. 21649. 

A series of Lepidoptera, from G. H. French, Carbondale, Illinois. Ace. 357. 

A large lot of dried Coleoptera, from G. W. J. Angell, New York ; collected in Vene- 
zuela. These were too much mutilated for scientific study, but a number of the most 
conspicuous forms are useful for exhibit purposes. Ace. 21743. 

Twelve specimens of spiders, from Dr. Edward Palmer; collected at San Pedro, 
Martin Island, Gulf of California. Ace. 11751. 

A large series of North American Myriapods, from C. H. Bollman, of Bloomington, 
Indiana. Ace. 21787. 

Thirty-five species of Coleoptera and 22 species of Ilemiptera, from A. L. Montan- 
don, Bucharest, Roumania; collected iu Eastern Europe; through Prof, C. V. Riley. 
Ace. 21846. 

A number of specimens of the "Aweto," a fungus growing from the body of a cater- 
pillar in New Zealand ; through Prof. C. V. Riley. Ace. 21864. 

A number of miscellaneous alcoholic insects, from C. Carlos, Cape Gracias, Nica- 
ragua. Ace. 21593. 

Eighty-four specimens (30 species) of Heteroptora, from A. L. Montandon, Bucha- 
rest, Roumania; through Prof. 0. V. Riley. Ace. 21992. 

A lot of alcoholic insects, mostly Coleoptera, through C. R. Orcutt, San Diego, Cal- 
ifornia. Among these were several really desirable species, especially a tine series of 
Schizopw sallei. Ace. 22108. 

Four species of rare Lepidoptera, collected in Florida, from W. E. Longley, 117 
Wabash avenue, Chicago. Ace. 21112. 

The routine work during the year, in addition to the special work upon 
the preparation of insect collections mentioned in the general review, 
has been : 

(1) Thenaming of specimens for collectors : Among the most important 
tasks of this kind have been the naming of seventy species of insects 
from photographic plates for H. G. Dyar, of Ehinebeck, New York ; 
determinations for Prof. O. Lugger, of the Minnesota Experiment 
Station ; Prof. S. A. Forbes, State Entomologist of Illinois; Prof. F. M. 



DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 379 

Webster, of the Indiana Experiment Station; David Bruce, of Brock- 
port, New York; John Dallas, of Fairfield, Connecticut, and C. R. 
Orcutt, of San Diego, California. 

(2) The arrangement and selection of material to be sent to specialists 
for determination. This is a very important item in the routine work 
of the department and occupies a great deal of time. It has been the 
policy to assist both specialists and the Museum itself 1>.\ sending col- 
lections in particular groups to specialists who happen to be just at the 
time working upon them. Thus the entire undetermined material in the 
Myriapoda was selected out, carefully listed, and sent to Mr. C. II. 
Bollman, of Bloomington, Illinois, during August. A large portion 
of the month of October was also spent iu collating the Curator's notes 
on the lepidopterous family Pyralidse, in collecting the biological 
material in this family, and in selecting a nearly complete series for 
Prof. IT. C. Fernald, of Amherst, Massachusetts. The material in the 
Halticid genera (Edionyehis and Disonycha was brought together and 
sent to Dr. George IT. Horn, of Philadelphia, who is working up the 
genera of the Halticuhe. Advantage was taken of the occasion to 
look over and rearrange the material in other genera of the family. 
Again, during April the Staphylinid material in certain genera was 
carefully selected out and forwarded to Capt. T. L. Casey, of New York 
City, for study, as he is engaging himself with this group of beetles. 

(3) The work of arranging in permanent shape all the reference or 
reserve collection. This is a matter of extremely slow accomplishment. 
The re-arrangement of the Coleoptera mentioned in the last annual report 
of this department has been continued, and, proceeding from the family 
Cicindelhke there mentioned as having been completed, the very large 
family Carabidse has been entirely re-arranged, occupying sixty-eight 
boxes in the reserve collection and eighteen double boxes in the dup- 
licate series. A beginning has been made with the succeeding families 
of water beetles, beginning with the Dytischbe. In addition to this 
work, which has occupied most of Mr. Lin ell's time, Mr. Lawrence 
I'.i iiner, entomologist to the Nebraska Experiment Station, during a 
visit to Washington in November, spent a number of days in working 
over the the Orthoptera of the collection, naming many of the hereto- 
fore-undetermined species and adding a number of his type species. 
Dr. S. W. Williston, of New Haven, also visited Washington during 
May, and devoted some little time to work upon the Diptera in the col- 
lection. 

(4) The actual care of the collection; its disinfection and preservation 
from iusect pests. This is a matter of considerable time. Twice or 
three times a year every box of the hundreds now upon the shelves 
must be carefully examined, disinfected with bisulphide of carbon or 
benzine in case the work of mU8eum pests is discovered, and the naptha- 

line cones used as preventives renewed. The entire collection was thus 
carefully gone over twice during the past year and was found iu most 
admirable condition. 



380 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Among the special researches based upon material belonging to the 
Department should be mentioned the following: 

(1) A monograph of the Sphingid;e of North America, by John B. 
Smith, which has been published during the year by the American 
Entomological Society of Philadelphia. 

(2) A paper upon the Acridiidse of North America, by Lawrence 
Bruner, which has been submitted for publication in the Proceedings of 
the Museum. 

(3) A paper entitled Notes and Descriptions of Braconidre, by Will- 
iam H. Ashmead, to be published in the Proceedings of the Museum. 

(4) A paper to be entitled Notes and Descriptions of Ichueumonidre, 
by William H. Ashmead, now nearly completed and to be published in 
the Proceedings of the Museum. 

(5) Two papers, with titles corresponding to those by Mr. Ashmead, 
just mentioned, are in preparation by myself, and include the new 
material in the Museum collection in these two families of parasitic 
Hymeuoptera not treated by Mr. Ashmead. 

(6) Several papers by C. H. Bollman, of Bloomington, Illinois, upon 
Myriopoda, which have been submitted for publication in the Proceed- 
ings of the Museum. 

(7) A report upon the Insects, Arachnids, and Myriapods collected 
by the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross during 1887 and 1888, 
submitted to the assistant secretary in charge of the Museum in June, 
by Mr. L. O. Howard. 

It will be very difficult at the present time to draw up a table show- 
ing the present state of the collection, indicating thenumber of specimens 
in all orders. This was carefully done iu the report of the Department 
for 1886-'87, and in the report forl887-'88 the statement was made that 
some 10,000 specimens had been added. During the present year, while 
several thousand specimens have been added to the collection, the work 
of rearrangement, except upon exhibit collections, has been so slow that 
a definite tabulated statement at the present time is impracticable. 
The work may be said to be just now in a transition state. The most 
urgent need of the department at the present time is additional help, 
to permit me to keep the rapid accumulations properly worked up. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES 

IX THE I . S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, L889. 



By RICHARD Rathbun, Honorary Curator. 



The duties of the Curator iu connection with the Fish Commission 
have prevented his giving much personal attention to his department 
during the past year. The exhibition hall, which has been closed for 
two or three years on account of the extensive repairs made to the 
Smithsonian building, has been thoroughly renovated and prepared for 
the use of the public. All of the collections have received constant care, 
and their condition in the several store-rooms has been greatly improved. 
But few accessions were received, owing chiefly to the fact that the Fish 
Commission, which has been its principal contributor ever since the 
department was reorganized in 1880, has made arrangements to care 
for its own collections of marine animals until they shall have been 
studied and reported upon. This will, in a measure, benefit the depart- 
ment by relieving it of the routine work incidental to the preservation 
and assorting of the large unworked collections sent in by the vessels 
and field parties of the Commission, wliile eventually it will become the 
recipient of valuable type series, representing the labors of recognized 
authorities in systematic zoology. It is expected, moreover, that these 
collections will be turned over to the Museum from time to time, as the 
work on the different groups is completed. 

The total number of accessions recorded is thirteen, none of which 
were of large size. Lieut. J. F. Moser, I'. S. Navy, commanding the 
Coast Survey steamer Bache, has contributed a small assortment of 
miscellaneous specimens dredged off Cape Sable, Florida, during the 
winter of 18*7-88. Mr. Henry Hemphill has sent in a number of speci- 
mens of crustaceans and sponges, obtained from kelp roots, off San 
Diego, California. Several freshwater crabs and shrimps have been 
received from Dr. Louis P. II. Birt, of the Nicaragua Canal Construc- 
tion Company. The\ were collected near ( ireytow ii, Nicaragua. Mr. 
Etomyn Hitchcock has presented a small collection of crustaceans and 
sponges from Japan; and Judge James ( i. Swan, several echini and 
crustaceans from Port Townsend, Washington. The remaining acces- 
sions do not require special mention.

382 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

During the greater part of the year, the west hall in the Smithsonian 
building, assigned to this department for exhibition purposes, was used 
for storing the general dried collection, pending the renovation of the 
bird hall, in one of the galleries of which it is regularly kept. This 
work being finished in the spring, the exhibition hall was again made 
ready for the public, the cases being newly painted on the inside, and 
the display collections re-arranged by the curator. The alcoholic speci- 
mens in the basement store-rooms were all gone over during the year, 
and the following groups, including both the identified and unidentified 
specimens, were arranged in systematic order, namely: the crustaceans, 
worms, holothunaus, ophiuraus, crinoids, hydroids, molluscoids, and 
sponges. This places the collection in better shape for reference than 
ever before, and the remaining groups will be taken up in the same 
manner during the next fiscal year. The collection of duplicate speci- 
mens was also revised and the card catalogue of the same completed. 

A collection of marine forms representing some of the investigations 
of the Fish Commission was prepared and transmitted to the Cincinnati 
Exposition during the summer of 1888, as a part of the exhibit accredited 
to the Commission. It consisted mainly of large showy specimens, but 
also contained examples of fish food and many microscopic preparations. 
After its return to Washington, in the autumn, the more interesting por- 
tions were added to the display series in the exhibition hall. When 
the collections of natural history, made during the cruise of the steamer 
Albatross from Norfolk to San Francisco, were received at Washington, 
in the winter of 1888-89, the new Fish Commission laboratory had not 
been constructed, and these collections were largely assorted and pre- 
pared for study in the work-rooms of this department, with such assist- 
ance as we were able to render. The curator has had but one assistant 
during the year, Miss M. J. Bathbun, on whom have devolved not only 
the care and preservation of tlie collections, but also, for the most part, 
the general supervision of the department, and its excellent condition 
at the present time is due chiefly to her conscientious labors. 

The Curator has given a limited amount of time to the study of the 
Madreporarian corals, and particularly those collected by the steamer 
Albatross in the Gulf of Mexico and on the voyage from Norfolk to San 
Francisco. Otherwise no special researches have been carried on in the 
department. Prof. A. E. Verrill and Prof. S. I. Smith are still con- 
tinuing their work upon the Fish Commission collections stored at the 
PeabodyMuseum of Yale College, the same beingnow the property of the 
National Museum. Prof. Edwin Linton is also giving his attention to 
the large series of internal parasites of fishes collected chiefly by him- 
self at the Wood's Holl station of the Fish Commission. Arrangements 
have been made with Prof. Walter Faxon, of the Museum of Compara- 
tive Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, to report upon the crayfishes 
added to the department since his memoir published in 1885; and Mr. 
J. Walter Fewkes has completed a paper on certain of the Albatross 
medusic obtained in the region of the Gulf Stream. 



DEPARTMENT OF MAKIXM INVERTEBRATES.

The collections made by the Albatross on the voyage around South 
America, were, as before explained, partly assorted in the laboratory of 
this department by Prof. Leslie A. Lee, the chief naturalist of the 
steamer daring that cruise, with the assistance of Miss Rathbun. Sub- 
sequently several of the groups of marine invertebrates were assigned 
to different naturalists for study and report, as follows: The echini and 
stalked crinoids, to Mr. Alexander Agassi/ ; the mollusca in general, to 
Mr. William II. Dall; the pteropods and heteropods, to Mr. .lames I. 
Tick; the brachyuia and isopoda, to Prof. Leslie A. Lee; the stomato- 
pods and free medusae, to Prof. W. K. Brooks; the hydroids to Mr. J. 
Walter Fewkes; the actinians, to Prof. J. P. McMurrich; the larval 
cephalopods, to Mr. S. Watase; the internal parasites of fishes, to Prof. 
Edwin Linton; the Madreporarian corals and starfishes to the curator. 

Notwithstanding the fact that so little special work has been placed 
upon the collections during the past year, the specimens have been re- 
tained in an exceptionally good state of preservation, and they are now 
so well arranged as to be available for reference or study without loss 
of time in finding all the representatives of each group, although the 
entire collection occupies the space of live good-sized store-rooms. Over 
three thousand entries have been made in the catalogue books, as ex- 
plained in the following table :

The following institutions have been supplied with duplicate sets of 
marine invertebrates from series No. iv, the character <>f which has 
bee'] described in previous reports. Bach set contains about one hun- 
dred and ten species, the most of which are preserved in alcohol. The 
varied character of the material comprising these sets makes them of 
great value for educational purposes:

In addition to the regular sets of duplicates, special collections were 
sent out as follows: Small lots of unmounted foraminifera to Hills- 
daleCollege, Hillsdale, Michigan ; to E. H. Galway, Washington, District 
of Columbia; and to George S. Lewis, jr., Springfield, Massachusetts; 
one specimen of Geryon quinquedens Smith to A. Milne-Edwards, Paris, 
France; specimens of seven species of Atlantic coast actinians to Prof. 
J. Playfair McMurrich for special study. 

No field work yielding results of interest to this department was 
conducted during the year under the auspices of the Museum, but it 
seems advisable to refer briefly to the mariue explorations of the Fish 
Commission, as lias been done in previous reports, for the reason that 
the materials obtained by that means will sooner or later be represented 
in the Museum. The Albatross left San Francisco July 4, 1888, on her 
first cruise to the Alaskan fishing grounds. Work was begun in the 
vicinity of the island of Uualashka, at the eastern end of the Aleutian 
chain, and carried thence eastward to the reported position of Pamplona 
Rocks, south of Prince William's Sound. Five principal fishing banks 
were developed in that region, all lying on the submerged continental 
plateau, and extending to its abrupt outer edge. The names of the 
banks are as follows : Davidson Bank, Saunakh Bank, Shumagin Bank, 
Albatross Bank, and Portlock Bank. Many dredge hauls, chiefly with 
the beam-trawl, were made over this area in different depths of water, 
and much shore collecting was also done on the adjacent islands and 
main-land. Leaving this region, a line of sounding and dredging stations 
was carried down the coast to the northern end of Vancouver's Island, 
whence the steamer proceeded through the inland passage to Paget 
Sound, dredging at intervals on the way. A month was subsequently 
spent on the outer coast of Washington and Oregon, the cruise termi- 
nating at San Francisco in October. The total number of hauls made 
with the dredge and beam-trawl was fifty, the depth of water ranging 
from 21 to 1,569 fathoms. In January, the Albatross started on a second 
cruise, this time to the coast of southern and Lower California, and 
the Gulf of California. Several months were spent in this region, 
and one hundred and fifty-five dredgings were made in depths of 5 
to 1,005 fathoms. The collections obtained on these two trips are very 
large ; they have been received in Washington by the Fish Commission, 
and are partly in course of elaboration . Lieut. Commander Z. L. Tanner 
has continued in command of the steamer during the year, with Mr. 
Charles H. Townseud as naturalist and Mr. A. B.Alexander as fishery 
expert. On the second cruise. Prof, Charles H. Gilbert, of the Uuiver- 



DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 385 

sity of Indiana, was placed temporarily in charge of the natural history 
work. 

During- the summer of 1888, the steamer Fish Hatch- made an investi- 
gation of the oyster beds of Providence River, and of New Haven, 
Connecticut, and during the following winter both the steamer Fish 
Hawk and the schooner Grampus were at work on the western and 
southern coast of Florida, the former in the interest of the mullet 
fishery, the latter making an investigation of the red snapper and 
grouper fishing grounds. On all of these cruises important natural 
history collections were obtained.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY 
IX THE (J. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 



By Frederick W. True, Acting Curator. 



The activities of the past year were exerted chiefly in the direction of 
reducing the accumulations of osteological material in the preparators' 
workshops and storage rooms. A large number of skulls and skeletons 
were cleaned and made available for students or for exhibition pur- 
poses. 

Definite plans were made for the beginning of an exhibition series of 
anatomical preparations of soft parts, but at the last moment the pre- 
parator to whom this work was to be entrusted was detached from the 
force to accompany the astronomical expedition to Angola. It has been 
found necessary, therefore, to postpone the commencement of this un- 
dertaking. 

The most important accessions during the year belonged to the classes 
of mammals and birds. The total number of the vertebrates received 
was small. As regards invertebrates it may be said that no attempt 
has thus far been made to acquire specimens for this department. The 
material received by the Museum is, of course, divided among the de- 
partments that have to do with the invertebrates. When the exhibi- 
tion scries of soft parts is begun, it is to be presumed that the necessary 
material will be drawn from the collections of these departments. 

Tin most important and striking addition to the exhibition scries of 
skeletons was the skeleton of an Atlantic Eight whale, Balcena biscay- 
ensis. This was purchased from Prof. II. A. Ward, of Rochester, New 
York, who procured it from Amagansett, Long Island. The skeleton, 
as now mounted, is about 43 feet long. The skeletons of several other 
important cetaceans were added to thecollection during the year. Most 
prominent among these is Sowerby's whale, Mesoplodon bidens, a male 
specimen of which was obtained through the crew of the U. S. Life- 
Saving Station at Atlantic City, New Jersey (('apt. .1. L. Gaskell, 
keeper). Further mention of this specimen will be found in the report 
of the department of mammals, (p. 350.) 



388 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The skull of a female Narwhal, bearing two equally- developed horns 
41 inches long, was purchased from Eobert Kinnes, of Dundee, Scot- 
laud. It was obtained by Capt. James Fairweather, of the steamship 
Aurora, of Dundee, in Prince Regent's Inlet, Lancaster Sound, in July, 
1887. From the TJ. S. Fish Commission were obtained a skeleton of a 
small Spotted dolphin, Prodelphinus longirostris, and one of the large 
spotted species, Prodelphinus plagiodon. The skeleton of a young 
Killer whale was obtained from Prof. Robert Collett, director of the 
Zoological Museum of Christiana, Norway, iu exchange for other speci- 
mens. Skulls of Balcenoptera rostrata, Delphinus delphis, and Phocwna 
communis were also received. 

The authorities of the Australian Museum presented skeletons of a 
number of Marsupials, including Guscus orientalis and Belideus artel. 
Of much importance for comparison with the West Indian seal is the 
skeleton of the Mediterranean seal, Monachus albiventer, presented by 
Prof. H. H. Giglioli, director of the Royal Zoological Museum of Flor- 
ence, Italy, in exchange for other specimens. 

The Museum purchased from Capt. F. Gr. Fry, a remarkably large 
and well-developed skeleton of a male Gorilla. 

One of the most interesting accessions during the year was the skele- 
ton of the Fork-tailed Gull, Greagrus furcatus, which, so far as known, 
is the only skeleton of this species of bird in any museum. It was 
obtained by the naturalists of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer 
Albatross. The Commissioner also presented a collection of birds of the 
Galapagos Islands, and of the Straits of Magellan. 

The authorities of the Auckland Museum presented a collection of 
typical New Zealand birds, preserved in alcohol. Among the speci- 
mens were representatives of the genera Stringops and Apteryx. 

A similar alcoholic collection of Australian birds, including species 
of various characteristic genera, such as Ocydromus, Calcenas, and 
Megapodius, was received from the Australian Museum, Sydney, New 
South Wales. 

Among the collections made by Dr. L. F. H. Birt, at Greytown, 
Nicaragua, were considerable numbers of birds in alcohol, including 
certain Trogons and Toucans, which had been among our desiderata. 
Six Elephant Tortoises, brought alive from the ( ralapagos Islands by the 
U. S. Fish Commission, died in captivity, and their skeletons were 
acquired by this department. The skeletons of two Boas were obtained. 

The most important change in the exhibition hall was the enlarge- 
ment of the large wall case on the north side of the hall by the addition 
of a west wing. The wing agrees in design with the remainder of the 
case, but is somewhat deeper. Its length is 21 feet; depth, 3 feet. On 
account of the additional space afforded it lias been possible to improve 
the arrangement of the mounted skeletons of Primates and Carnivores. 

The purchase of the large skeleton of a Right Whale, already referred 
to, made it necessary to change the position of all the large whalebone 



DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. 389 

whales, previously on exhibition. After the consideration it was 
thought best to bang the skeleton of the Humpback Whale, which is 
somewhat lighter than the others, from large iron brackets at the east 
side of the hall. A suitable design was made by Mr. Lucas, assistant 

curator, and the brackets were made by tin- People's Iron Works, 
Philadelphia. The skeleton was hung without difficulty, and the plan 
proved entirely satisfactory. It is improbable that we shall be able to 
suspend any more large skeletons from the roof of this hall, and in the 
future must resort to other methods of installation. Skeletons of the 
Great Bowhead and the Sperm Whale, which are still among our desid- 
erata, would be much heavier than any of the skeletous now in position. 
Each of the series represented in the exhibition collection has received 
more or less important additions during the year. The number of 
specimens in each series at the end of the year was as follows :

As already stated, the preparators were engaged chiefly in cleaning 
and preparing for the exhibition and study series a portion of the 
material that had accumulated in the workshops and storagerooms. 
One preparator was engaged almost exclusively in cleaning the skulls 
of small species of mammals deposited by the Department of Agricul- 
ture. About five hundred of these skulls were cleaned during the year. 

A considerable part of the time of the chief preparator was occupied 
by the arrangement of the collection of vertebrate fossils, and in mount- 
ing a cast of the skeleton of Vinoceros, winch work, though very neces- 
sary, was not connected with this Department. Mr. Lucas was also 
detailed to pack the collection of mammals exhibited in the Cincinnati 
Exposition.

REPORT (IX THE DEPARTMENT OF PALEOZOIC FOSSILS 
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, L889. 



By C. 1). Walcott, Honorary Curator. 



In the annual report for the last fiscal year, I stated that 10,955 
specimens had been placed in the exhibition cases. During the first 
six months of the present fiscal year Dr. E. E. Guiiey was engaged in 
rewriting the labels of the exhibition series and in incorporating the 
new material which he had worked over in the laboratory. I had an- 
ticipated adding quite largely to the collections from the material be- 
longing to the Geological Survey now stored in the laboratory, but 
owing to a long absence in the field and a subsequent determination to 
pnblish a paper on the fauna of the Olenellus /one, little opportunity 
has occurred to work on the collections. 

Dr. Gurley began, about March 1 last, a study and arrangement of 
the graptolites contained in the Museum collection. During the months 
of May and June he was engaged in collecting graptolites in the Hud- 
son River valley of ^New York, and it is expected that the specimens 
there obtained will be incorporated in the Museum collections during 
the present fiscal year. My own field and office work during the past 
year has contributed to the Museum collections a large series of Lower 
and Middle Cambrian fossils from Newfoundland. The Lower Cambrian 
genera and species have been worked out and named, and a number of 
new genera and species added to the collections. From Newfoundland 
alone, some three thousand specimens have been transferred to the Mu- 
seum. The collection of fossils from the Silurian (Ordovician) rocks has 
not been materially enlarged, owing to lack of time to transfer the 
collections made by the Geological Survey and now stored in the 
laboratory of this department in the Museum building. During the 
year large collections were made from the Silurian (Ordovician) rocks 
of New York which will ultimately be transferred to the Museum. 

A report on "The Fauna of the Olenellus /one" is now completed 
and will l»e published by the U. S. Geological Survey. A paper con- 
taining the descriptions of the new genera and species was transmitted 
for publication in the Proceedings of the National Museum. 

The more important accessions received during the year are: 

Accession 19889.— This accession includes the type and figured specimens of Dr. 
D. D. Owen, which were used in his pioneer work in tin- Upper Mississippi Valley.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



This collection is of historic value, and is a most interesting addition to the Museum 
collections, although many types are missing. 

Accession 2G525. — The Lea collection, which contains a number of fine specimeus 
that arc suitable for the exhibition series, and a large number for the student col- 
lection. 

Accession 21650 is of value in affording the means of comparison between the 
Cambrian fauna of Sweden and that of North America. There are a number of 
species illustrating genera that arc not known from North American strata. 

Accession 21716 is a small but very welcome addition to the Museum collections, 
as the fauna of the Calciferous terrane of New York is very meager and but poorly 
represented in the collections. 

Accession 21838 adds materially to the series of graptolites and, with accession 
21887, gives the Museum a fair representation of that fauna from Canada. 

Accession 21855 gives the data for comparison of an extensive group of problemat- 
ical fossils from the Silurian (Ordovician) strata of Portugal with somewhat similar 
forms from Great Britain and North America. 

Accession 21861 contains the types of thirteen species, and the collection is of 
interest and value from its having been the means of settling a most important geo- 
logic question in relation to North American geology. United with accession 21914 
it gives the largest series of Cambrian fossils yet obtained from Newfoundland. 

Accessions 21904 and 21869 add to the means of comparison of the European Cam- 
brian fauna with that of North America, and also give a representation of several 
genera not hitherto known to the Museum collections.

The collection contains seven hundred and thirty-seven specimens, representing 04 
genera and 103 species. 

As a whole, the accessions for the year are a valuable addition to the 
exhibition and study series of the Museum. 

The material in the collections has been increased during the year by 
the addition of 0,477 specimens. 

The catalogue numbers taken up during the year are from 17,847 to 
18,430, both inclusive. 

I respectfully repeat the recommendation, urged in my previous an- 
nual reports, that a sum be reserved, annually, for increasing the Museum 
collection by the purchase of small collections of type specimens, which 
can not be obtained in any other way. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MESOZOIC FOSSILS 
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, L889. 



By C. A. White, Honorary Curator. 



Although the time which could be devoted to the work of the de- 
partment has been very limited, owing - to the official duties devolving 
upon me and my assistants in connection with the U. S. Geological Sur- 
vey, the fossil collections in the Museum have been put into better and 
more accessible shape than they have ever been in before. The ordinary 
routine work of the division has also been performed as usual. 

Aside from important collections of fossils which have been both 
formally and informally turned over from the U. S. Geological Survey 
to the Museum, the accessions have not been numerous during the year; 
the number in all being only thirteen. The most important of these 
last named accessions are the type specimens of twelve species of Creta- 
ceous fossils which were published in the Geological report of Dr. David 
Owen on Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and which were transmitted 
to the Museum by President D. S. Jordan, of the Indiana State Uni- 
versity. Besides these a small but interesting collection of Cretaceous 
fossils from St. Paul's and St. Peter's Islands in the Straits of Magellan 
were received through the U. S. Fish Commission. They were collected 
by members of the Commission upon the cruise of the Steamer Albatross 
of 1888-'8(>. 

Up to the beginning of the past year none of the fossils of this division 
had been properly installed for exhibition. Early in the present calen- 
dar year the Director of the Museum assigned ten glass top-frames to 
ten of the fifteen cases which had been previously assigned to this di- 
vision in the southeast court. He also detailed Dr. \\. R. Gurley to aid 
in the work of installing selections of fossils in the cases mentioned, and 
tlic work was accomplished by him and my assistant, Mr. C. B, Boyle, 
jointly, who were assisted for a month by a temporary assistant, Mr. C. 
\V. Hayes, of the Geological Survey. 

The collections which now till the glass covered cases consist mainly 
of the numerous type specimens of the species which have been pub- 
lished in the various Government reports.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY 
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



By GEORGE VaSEY, Honorary Curator. 



In view of the grear amount of current work, I have not been able to 
make a catalogue of the plants contained in the Herbarium, but am only 
able to state in general, that that part of the Herbarium which is iu 
the Department of Agriculture is disposed in eases which are arranged 
against the walls of three rooms, occupying in all a wall-space of about 
85 running feet; that the cases are 8 feet high and divided into spaces 
about inches high, 13 inches wide, and 18 inches deep; and that of 
such spaces there are about 16 in each row, making a total of more than 
1,300 spaces or shelves. We estimate that the shelves each contain, on 
an average, about one hundred sheets, or altogether more than one hun- 
dred and twenty thousand sheets. These are properly arranged in or- 
ders, genera, and species, and labeled so as to be readily accessible. 
We have a large quantity yet to be mounted and added to the collec- 
tion, besides a great number of duplicates for distribution and exchange. 

The Department of Agriculture has employed for a part of the yeai 
three agents to collect botanical specimens and information respecting 
the vegetation of little known regions. One of these agents has operated 
in western Texas, one in California (Southern and Lower), and one in 
Washington From these agents we have received a large quantity of 
of botanical specimens. 

We have received as additions to the Herbarium through the Smith- 
sonian Institution a valuable set of plants collected by officers of the 
U. S. Fish ( 'oinmission steamer A Ibatrossin South America and Alaska; 
also several packages collected by Lieutenant Pond of the U. S. Navy, 
in Lower California and the islands adjacent. We have also received 
through the Smithsonian Institution, a collection of four hundred spe- 
cies of the plants of Japan, collected by Mr. S. Tegima of the Tokyo 
Educational .Museum, Tokyo, Japan. 

We have made from our duplicate collections distributions to the fol- 
lowing societies: 

To the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia. 
To the Herbarium of the Jardin ties Plautes, Paris, Prance. 
To the Herbarium of the British Museum, London, England. 
To the Royal Herbarium, Kew, England.

IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



By F. W. CLARKE, Honorary Curator. 



In general the work of the year has followed the usual lines with little 
variation. The only notable divergence was iu the matter of the ex- 
hibit at the Cincinnati Centennial Exposition, in which the Department 
was represented merely by a single case of specimens, to illustrate the 
-cms and precious stones of North America. In the preparation of 
that exhibit a \'v\v very choice gems were added to the collection. 

The growth of the collection during the year has been highly satis- 
factory, and especially so as regards the quality of the material obtained. 
The two most important accessions were received from the U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey, in collections made by Profs. S. L. Pentield and W. F. 
Hillebrand, respectively. The Penfield collection was obtained in two 
seasons of field work in and near St. Lawrence County, Xew York, and 
numbers 1,366 specimens, of which a considerable number are dupli- 
cates. It is exceedingly rich in black, brown, and white tourmaline, 
\\ bite and green phlogopite, diopside, calcite, albite crystals, oligoclase, 
danburitc, wollastonite, tremolite, etc., and it contained several almost 
unique specimens. Of the latter I may mention a huge mass of green 
fluorite, superbly crystallized, a large pyrite crystal, a radiated brown 
tourmaline, and a series of most brilliant peristerite feldspars. Dr. 
1 1 illebrand's collection was made during a six weeks trip to the Far West, 
in which he visited the cryolite locality near Pike's Peak; the Tintic 
District in Utah: Silver City, Georgetown, and Las Oruces, New Mex- 
ico; and the Copper Queen .Mine in Arizona. The collection embraces 
the cryolite groups of minerals, a magnificent series ofinixite, tyrolite, 
eiinite, and clinoclasite ; some very brilliant and unusual descloizite, 
finely crystallized wulfenites, and some extraordinary azurites and 
fibrous malachite. On his journey Dr. Hillebrand also made some pur- 
chases for the Museum, securing among other things a lot of turquoise 
from Los Cerillos, New Mexico, numbering 363 specimens, mostly dupli- 
cates. The descloizite from Georgetown, New Mexico, was ;i new dis- 
covery, and Mr. Alex. McGregor, manager of the mine in which it oc- 
curs, has since sent the Museum a superb series of si specimens, m-

eluding several choice examples of vauadinite. Both of these species 
are rare. Dr. Hillebraud also secured valuable gifts of specimens for 
the Museum from Mr. Richard Pearce, of Denver, and from Messrs. J. 
W. Howell and B. Williams, of Bisbee, Arizona. In addition to the 
Peufield and Hillebrand collections, the Geological Survey has also con- 
tributed 37 specimens of wood-opal, collected by Dr. A. 0. Peale in 
Montana. 
Important gifts of minerals were received from the following donors : 

From the Australian Museum at Sidney, fifteen specimens of pkacolite, embolite, 
etc. 

From W. H. Beck, of Washington, fourteen specimens of a new variety of des- 
cloizite from Montana. 

From Mrs. A. C. Bidwell, of Clip, Arizona, live specimens of dmnortierite. 

From D. A. Bowman, of Bakersville, North Carolina, specimens of kyanite, beryl, 
and transparent oligoclase. From one of tke kyanites a fine gem has been cut. 

From W. G. Clark aud G. M. Wilson, of Mullan, Idaho, specimens of plattnerite. 
This rare species has been lost sight of for nearly fifty years, and its new occurrence 
is quite noteworthy. 

From the Drake Company, Sioux Falls, Dakota, four polished slabs of<the Arizona 
agatized wood. 

From H. G. Hanks, of San Francisco, four large crystals of hanksite, the types of 
a published article. 

From J. A. Lucas, of Silver City, New Mexico, eight pseudomorphs of native copper 
after azurite. 

From S. Scott, of Rapid City, Dakota, fifty-nine specimens of minerals from the 
Black Hills. 

From Hon. John Sherman, a large mass of polydymite from Canada. This rare 
ore of nickel contained traces of platinum. 

From Prof. H. L, Wells, of Yale University, a specimen of the new mineral sperry- 
lite. 

, By exchange the collection has been moderately increased. Nineteen 
specimens were thus obtained from G. L. English & Co., of Philadel- 
phia; 85 specimens from the museum at Auckland, New Zealand; 
327 specimens from C. W. Kesler, of North Carolina, and 128 specimens 
from Joseph Willcox. 

In addition to the specimens already mentioned, a number of choice 
minerals were secured by purchase. From J. W. Beath, of Philadel- 
phia, forty -seven specimens of gems were bought, iucluding one dia- 
mond in the gaugue. From C. S. Bement, a large mass of crystallized 
azurite, probably the finest specimen in existence. From F. H. Butler, 
of London, two choice crystals of the Egremont calcite. From Dr. F. 
E. Chatard, a specimen of native silver from Chili weighing eighteen 
ounces. From G. L. English & Co., eighteen miscellaneous specimens, 
including the new species beryllouite, and a unique crystal of galena. 
From A. E. Foote, three remarkable aznrites, a specimen of opal agate, 
aud a choice calcite twin. From Tiffany & Co., four cut specimens of 
agatized wood, two disks of concentric azurite and malachite, and a 
fine Siberian tablet representing various small fruits carved in differ- 
ent ornamental stones.

These accessions represent the greater part of the material received 
during the year. On the debit side, the Museum was impoverished by 
the withdrawal of the Willcox collection, which had been a feature of 
the mineral exhibit for over four years. Eight hundred specimens 
were sent out to complete more than twenty exchanges, and sixteen 
sets of duplicates were distributed to colleges and schools. 

The last catalogue number in June, 1888, was 47,837 ; in June 1889, 
48,468. During the year 5,794 individual specimens weie catalogued. 
The routine work of the department has been performed as usual by 
the Assistant Curator, W. S. Yeates, with characteristic faithfulness 
and efficiency. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF LITHOLOGY AND PHYSICAL GEOLOGY 
IN THE I". S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 1889. 



By George P. Merrill. Curator. 



So far as is to be judged from the mere acquisition of materials, the 
year just closed has been one of unprecedented activity and progress 
in this department. This may be accounted lor by the fact that (1) the 
Curator has been enabled to visit in person sundry localities and obtain 
thence desirable materials, and that (2) the department having become 
fairly established and with a fair amount of duplicate material, we have 
been enabled to make a series of profitable exchanges. The U. S. 
Geological Survey has also furnished much valuable matter, as will 
be noted later. 

On July 17 the Curator left on a collecting trip into southwestern 
North Carolina, returning on the 20th. The main points visited were 
Webster, Jackson County, and the corundum mines at Cullasaja, 
MacoD County. Prom these localities were obtained several hundred 
pounds of necessary material, consisting chielly of rocks of the peridotite 
and pyroxenite groups. On August 4 a second trip was made into Penn- 
sylvania, followed during the summer vacation by excursions into 
northern New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, eastern Massachusetts, 
and as far east as Hast port, Maine. 

The material collected during these trips will be noted under the 
head of neeessions, but mention may be made here of a line series of 
slates from Lehigh and Northampton Counties, which were selected 
with a view to illustrating the efficacy of pressure in the production 
of slaty cleavage. Blocks were obtained, showing very plainly the emi- 
nent cleavage at a sharp angle wit h t he bedding, and also blocks which 
through lack of homogeneity in various layers, yielded unequally to the 
compressive force, the finer grained and more uniform portions becom- 
ing evenly and finely fissile, while the coarser layers were crimped, 
crushed, or repeatedly faulted in a very instinctive manner. 

A series of photographs was also obtained to illustrate certain physi- 
cal phenomena, such as could not be illustrated by means of speci- 
mens.

NOTES ON THE MORE IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS. 

The more important accessions of the year are included in the fol- 
lowing list:

also lor duplicates. 

ROUTINE WORK. 

Since the death of Mr. A. J. Forney, which took place October 30, 1888, 
the department has been without a preparator skilled in stone cutting 
and polishing, and hence but little work of this nature has been done. 
Mr. J. O. Hargrove, who was appointed as a temporary assistant on 
September 25, has rendered very satisfactory service in trimming hand 
specimens for the exhibition and study series, and has rendered valu- 
able assistance in the work of re arranging the exhibition series. The 
clerical work of the department has been carried on, as during the pre- 



408 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

vious year, in a very satisfactory manner by Mr. W. B. Merrimon. 
Work was begun early in the fall of 1888 with a view to preparing one 
hundred sets of rocks, of fifty specimens each, to meet the numerous de- 
mands from educational institutions, and it was hoped that the entire 
series might be made ready for distribution before the close of the year. 
That it is not as yet ready, is due in a large degree to the lack- of satis- 
factory storage space, though there are also lacking certain materials 
that are essential to the completion of the series. It is hoped that we 
may be able to obtain these during the coming summer. A rc-assign- 
inent of storage space, it should be noted, has necessitated once more 
a moving of the entire collection of duplicates and unassorted materials. 
Twenty-three sets of duplicates, mostly in the way of exchanges, were 
sent out during the year. They are as follows : 

July 11. — To Dr. Stephen Bowers, Ventura, California, two specimens of serpentine 
from Montville, New Jersey.

410 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

PRESENT STATE 01 THE COLLECTION. 

Concerning the present state of the collection little can be said that 
would not be a repetition of what has been given in my previous re- 
ports. The collection of building and ornamental stones, as now in- 
stalled, tills thirteen door screen cases, one wall case, two large pyra- 
mids, and the tops of three table cases. The systematic collections illus- 
trating the composition of the earth's crust in its least altered form, 
that is, the collections of rocks and rock-forming minerals, are now, so 
far as mere number of specimens is concerned, as large as seems ad- 
visable with our present limited amount of space. They still need, how- 
ever, more or less sifting out and replacement as new and, for the pur- 
poses, better material is obtained. In this rock-collection, it should be 
stated, an attempt is made not merely to show all the kinds of rocks which 
go to make up any appreciable amount of the earth's crust, but also to a 
certain extent their geographical distribution. It is deemed of more 
importance, for instance, to show basalts from America, Europe, and 
Australia, even though they may closely resemble one another, than to 
show an equal number of varieties all from one region. These collec- 
tions now comprise some 2,000 specimens, and are arranged in one pier- 
case and seven slope- top table-cases on the south side of the exhibition 
hall. The collections of dynamic and historical geology have both re- 
ceived important accessions, but, owing to a lack of proper cases as well 
as necessary materials to fill important gaps in the series, no attempt 
has been made to arrange them systematically. In the historical series, 
I may say, it is not the intention to show rocks of any particular region 
arranged according to their geological sequence, but to show rather that 
the various processes of rock formation are not as a rule confined to any 
particular geological epoch, but, though particularly active at certain 
periods, have been carried on more or less intermittently from the ear- 
liest times to the most recent. The preparation of such a collection in- 
volves a great amount of time and care in its selection, even under the 
most favorable circumstances. 

The figures given below regarding the actual number of specimens 
are to be regarded as only approximate. As has been mentioned iu 
previous reports, the practice of bringing in material iu bulk and break- 
ing or cutting up as occasion demands, renders it impossible to give 
exact figures, excepting in the cases of the approximately complete ex- 
hibition series and the monograph collections of the study series. 

Number of specimens in reserve series 23, 500 

Number of specimens iu duplicate series 3,500 

Total 27,000 

The reserve series is distributed as follows :

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGY 
IX THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



By F. !'. Dewey, Curator, 



The chief work of the department for the year has been the prepara- 
tion and arrangement of the material for exhibition in the southwest 
court upon the plan which was commenced during the previous year. 

A i first it was contemplated to prepare only one-half of the court for 
exhibition and then throw it open to the public, but afterwards it was 
decided to prepare the whole court before any portion was thrown open. 
This necessitated some changes in the plan of the work, and especially 
as regards the disposition of duplicate and reserve material. It also 
increased the labor of handling the specimens, owing to the crowded 
condition of both the exhibition and storage spaces. The work was 
pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and the court was thrown open 
to the public about the middle of April. 

In this work of condeusing the exhibits to tit the restricted space, it 
was necessary to remove a large number of specimens from the exhibi- 
tion scries for want of space. Although the cases are even now over- 
crowded, fully one-third of the exhibition series, as it stood when this 
work of transfer began, has been removed and divided between the 
reserve and duplicate series. 

In February the Curator made a visit to Providence, lihode Island, 
to examine a very valuable collection of petroleum and related mate- 
rials which had been made for the .Museum by Prof. S. F. Peck ham. 
Arrangements were made for sending the collection to Washington in 
such shape that a portion of it could be immediately placed upon ex- 
hibition, in order to continue and complete the collection illustrating 
the subject of carbon in the systematic series. 

The latter part ot May the Curator joined the party of American en- 
gineers which visited Europe at the invitation of the English, French, 
and German Engineering societies, and was absent from Washington 
dining the balance of the .\car. On this trip the Curator visited t he 
museums of London and Paris and also spent considerable time at the 
exposition in Paris. 

The most important accession received during the year was the col- 
lection of petroleums mentioned above. This collection was made for 

413 



414 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

the Museum by Prof. S. F. Peckham, of Providence, Rhode Island, 
who also prepared the Tenth Census report upon the same subject, 
and by the connections formed while making this report, he was enabled 
to gather many specimens, especially those of historical value, which 
otherwise it would have been impossible to obtain. The collection con- 
lains three hundred and fifty specimens, and illustrates very fully the 
occurrence of crude petroleum in this country, and also contains some 
representatives of foreign petroleums. A very complete illustration of 
the technology of the subject, numbering one hundred and fifty-four 
specimens and donated by Mr. T. G. MoMasters, Pittsburgh, Pennsyl- 
vania, is included in this collection. 

The illustrations of petroleums have been further enriched by a col- 
lection ot one hundred and twenty-nine specimens received from Prof. 
J. J. Stevenson, of New York, in exchange for a collection of ores. 
While the specimens in this collection are mostly small, it fills several 
gaps in the Peckham collection and is a valuable addition. 

Among the collections received during the year which are especially 
valuable, should also be mentioned a complete illustration of the quick- 
silver industry at New Almaden, California. The collection shows a 
complete series of the different characters of ores, together with the asso- 
ciates and rocks of the deposit, a complete illustration of the process of 
extracting the metal, a very extensive and interesting series of views 
in and about the mines and works, including a few underground pictures 
which are especially valuable, a large number of publications relating 
to the history and development of the mines, and a very interesting 
and instructive glass model of the mine, showing the contour of the sur- 
face and the excavations made underground in working the miue. 

A series representing the smelting of pig-iron, by the Shelby Iron 
Company at Shelby, Alabama. This collection was made upon the gen- 
eral plau adopted for the collections at the New Orleans Exposition. 

An interesting series of photographs of the Jones and Laughlin Works 
at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, including a view of the Bessemer con- 
verter, taken at night by the light of its own flame, presented by Gret- 
ton Bros. 

A series of iron oxides from New Hampshire, which are used for paints, 
obtained from Prof. C. H. Hitchcock, in exchange. 

A large model of Aspen Mountain, Colorado, prepared for use in a 
celebrated law-suit to determine the ownership of very valuable mines. 
It shows the contour and geology of the surface, and, by means of sec- 
tions, the underground geology and miniug work. 

Three serhs of foreign ores, one from the Australian Museum, one 
from the Auckland Museum, in New Zealand, and the third, represent- 
ing the occurrence of manganese ores at Santiago de Cuba, presented 
by Tirso Boca y Agusli, and forwarded by Consul Otto K. Keimer. 

Two researches have been carried on during the year by the Curator. 
The first was an examination of the production of remarkably strong

pig-iron at the Mtiirkirk Furnace, 14 miles from Washington. The 
second was an examination of the nickel from Russell's Springs, Kan- 
sas, undertaken at the request of the Hon. ,1. J. Lngalls. 

The total number of specimens in the department remains about the 
same as at the end of last year, 51,000, the additions during the year 
being counterbalanced by the removal of worthless material; 12,000 
specimens are on exhibition ; 15,000 are duplicates, and 12,000 are in 
the reserve series. The balance consists of unclassified material which 
is at present considered as reserve material. 

One hundred and six accessions have been received during the year, 
of which 69, containing 111 specimens, were for examination and 
report. Five special reports were made in answer to questions sub- 
mitted. 

In cataloguing the collection, 505 entries, covering 001 specimens, 

have been made; and 5,459 card catalogue cards have been written. 

First entry in July, 1888 51,540 59.465 66,432 68,493 

Last entry in June, 1889 51,662 59,601 66,584 68,5«4 

Forty-eight boxes of duplicate and reserve material have been placed 
in general storage, and fifty-seven specimens have been sent out in ex- 
change. 

During the year the Curator has published three articles. The first 
entitled Pig Iron of Unusual Strength, in the Transactions of the Ameri- 
can Institute of Mining Engineers,* gives the result of the research into 
the operation of the Muirkirk Furnace. The second, relating to the 
nickel ore of Russell's Springs, Logan County, Kansas, was a prelimi- 
nary note on the subject, published in the Engineering and Mining 
Journal,! and the third, on the same subject, published in the Trausac 
tions of the American Institute of .Mining Engineers,!" gives the result 
of the examination of this nickel ore. 

The clerical work of the department has been ably performed during 
the year by Mr. W. H. Newkall, assisted during a portion of the time 
by Mr. T. R. Turnbull.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF LIVING ANIMALS 
IN THE U. SANATION AL MUSEUM, L889. 



By W. T. Hoknaday, Honorary Curator. 



The collection of living animals lias increased during the year to the 
to the utmost limit under the circumstances which now regulate its ex- 
istence. The building in which the animals are exhibited, has for months 
been tilled to its utmost capacity, and the crowds of visitors which daily 
visited the collection were often so great as to cause general discomfort. 
The open yards were so completely filled with large animals that it was 
only by the greatest difficulty that all the specimens were finally accom- 
modated. 

Under such conditions, when the accommodations for the collections 
had been expanded to their utmost limits, it was found necessary to 
check the increase of the number of specimens, both by declining gifts 
when possible to do so, and by discontinuing entirely the purchase of 
specimens. 

Although the collection of living animals lias attracted its full share 
of attention from visitors to the Museum, everything else accomplished 
by the department during the year becomes of small importance in com- 
parison with the work accomplished in connection with the establish- 
ment by Congress of the National Zoological Park. In the belief that in 
no other way could the < urator render more valuable service to the pub- 
lic, he devoted much of his time, during both sessions of the Fiftieth 
Congress, to efforts calculated to induce Congress to establish at once 
i national zoological .garden on a liberal scale. In this, the codec 
tion of living animals played an important part. The crowds of visi- 
tors which daily thronged a small, illy ventilated and highly uncom- 
fortable temporary building, furnished abundant testimony to the eager- 
ness of American people generally to learn more about our American 
fauna. 

The valuable gifts of living creatures which came in from all parts of 
the United States, even faster than accommodations could be provided 
for them, proved conclusively the readiness of the public to contribute 
liberally and generally to ;i national collection of living animals. The 
demand for ample room and for the ''est facilities for the care and (lis

play of the collection thus commenced, became very general. In the 
end it proved to be irresislable ; and in comparison with the great re- 
sult finally reached on March 2, 1889, all other work accomplished by 
this department during the year becomes of small importance. 

On the part of the Curator there was no opportunity for any special 
researches upon material belonging to the department. The time and 
effort which it was necessary for him to devote to the plan for a Zoo- 
logical Park, and also to the department of taxidermy, rendered it im- 
possible to accomplish for the collection of living animals anything 
but the routine work necessary to its existence ; and, but for the valua- 
ble and energetic service rendered by Keeper Weeden, and the practi- 
cal responsibilities assumed by him, more important work would have 
been compelled to suffer neglect. 

The only work accomplished by the Curator, which in any way par- 
took of the character of investigation and research, was the prepara- 
tion of an extended memoir on the extermination of the American 
bison, with a sketch of its discovery and life history. This publica- 
tion, which appeared in the annual report of the National Museum for 
3887, was rendered necessary by reason of the fact that the fate of al- 
most total extinction, which has befallen the buffalo, is now threatening 
all our most valuable quadrupeds, and unless public attention is drawn 
to the great undesirability of the policy of extermination, our most in- 
teresting quadrupeds will before long be swept out of existence. 

In order to still further direct public attention to this universal war 
of extermination which is now being prosecuted against all our best 
game animals, the Curator, by direction of the Assistant Secretary, 
brought together a large collection of objects illustrating this subject 
in a graphic manner. This collection was prepared especially for dis- 
play at the Ohio Valley Centennial Exposition, held at Cincinnati, to 
which it was duly forwarded for exhibition. The following editorial de- 
scription of this exhibit, from Forest and Stream, of September 22, 1888, 
may properly be reproduced here for the purpose of still further carry 
ing out the object for which the exhibit was made, viz : to draw atten- 
tion to a subject of national importance: 

"In the Smithsonian department of the Cincinnati Exposition there is now to he 
.seen a startling exhibit. It is a collection of objects which have been brought 
together by Mr. W. T. Hornaday, to illustrate and impress upon the mind of the 
obf-erver the fact; that nearly all of our most conspicuous aud interesting game quad- 
rupeds are rapidly being exterminated, aud will soou disappear forever. The lesson 
it teaches is both impressive and saddening to every lover of animated nature, and 
like all the lessons taught by the National Museum collections, it is strictly true. 

"The most prominent feature of the exhibit is a series of mounted specimens rep- 
resenting the species of American mammals which have become extinct (in a wild 
state, at least), and also those which are now approaching extinction. The buffalo, 
Californian sea elephant, aud West Indian seal are represented as having become ex- 
tinct in a wild state, with the exception of perhaps a score of stragglers which the 
hunters have not yet found, in the series of species threatened with speedy extirpa- 
tion are found the mountain sheep, mountain goal, elk, a tine group of antelopes of 



DEPARTMENT OF LIVING ANIMALS. 41 ( J 

various ages, the moose, caribou, black tail deer, beaver, otter, sea otter, walrus and 
grizzly bear. 

"The story of the great buffalo slaughter is very graphically told. A mounted speci- 
men ami a series <>t' .superb photographic enlargements of t lie various specimens com- 
posing the large mounted group in the National Museum, represent the species as it 
unci' nourished. Opposite these hang another series of pictures, three of which are 
large oil paintings, illustrating the methods employed in the destruction of the 
buffalo. The tirst ia a representation of the 'Chase on Horseback/ which the label 
deciaies to have been the only fair ami sportsmanlike mode of hunting ever practiced 
by either reds or whites. Nex1 to this hangs a magnificent oil painting, executed, 
by special order, by J. H. Moser, of Washington, entitled 'The Still Hunt.' This 
represents the typical still-hunter, who killed buffalo by the hundred for hides, 
worth a dollar each. The hunter is Lying flat on the ground at the top of the ridge 
'pumping' bullets from a Sharp's rifle at a bunch of buffalo, on which ho has "got 
a stand." A dozen or more have fallen, but the stupid brutes stand there in wonder, 
while the remorseless butcher pours in the bullets of death. In the distance a snowy 
plain, backed by snow-clad mountains, is 'black with buffalo,* to the number of ten 
thousand or more. The picture is a very striking and truthful representation of the 
method by which the destruction of seven or eight million buffalo was accomplished 
iu a few short years. 

"Other pictures in this series represent the other methods employed iu killing 
buffalo, chiefly by Indians, such as impounding, hunting on suowshoes, hunting in 
disguise, ' the surround,' etc. On three large flat screens are shown samples of 'the 
objects lor which the buffalo was exterminated.' One is a skin of a largo buffalo 
bull, and another is a cowskin, both in a raw state, just as they came from 'the 
range,' where tin- former sold for the insignificant sum of $1.25 and the latter brought 
even less. A third specimen is a bull hide, taken in the summer when almost bare 
of hair, for use as leather, ami having only about half the value of the robe. The label 
attached to this specimen fitly characterizes the hunters who killed buffaloes iu sum- 
for hides as "greedy wretches.' 

"Last come two objects to show what remains of our most valuable American quad- 
ruped. < >n a section of Montana prairie, 8 feet by 10, lies the complete skeleton 
of a Large buffalo bull, just as it was found bleaching on the range, and just as ten 
thousand others lie today. The powerful action of the weather has stripped every 
particle of flesh from the bones, and Left them clean and white, but still attached to 

each other by their dried-up ligaments, the Legs in position precisely as the animal 
fell. It is a ghastly object, and surely mast awaken a feeling of remorse in the breast 
of every old buffalo hunter who comes face to face with it as he passes along the 
main aisle. Hanging near it is another large oil painting by Moser, entitled " Where 
flu- Millions Have Gone." It represents a Bcene on the Montana buffalo range as it 
is to-day. A wide plain is covered with bleaching buffalo skeletons, similar to the 
actual skeleton already mentioned, as weird and ghastly a scene as could bo found 
anywhere outside a charnel-house. 

" One of the most startling features of this strange display is a lot of seventy tanned 
skins of the rare and little-known Rocky Mountain goat, which the label explains 
were purchased in New York, fully tanned and dressed, at $1.50 each, and originally 
sold in Denver at Mi cents each, lobe made into cheap rugs and mats. This shows 

what railroads and breech-loaders are doing for the game in the West. When it is 

possible lor the pot-hunters to gel ai even the mountain -oat in its remote and dan- 

gerous fastnesses, kill them by the score and sell their hides at 50 cents each, we can 
ut on our fingers the number of years within which the total extinction of this 
rare and interesting quadruped is likely to be accomplished, in this country at Least. 
'Act. in newspapers occasionally report hunters as hauling in a wagon load of 
mountain goats at a time. The Cincinnati lot includes the pelts of adult male, and 
females and young of ill ages, even to kids If the members of Stat< and ferritoi 



420 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

legislatures in the West could see this lot of skins ami read the descriptive label 
attached to it, they might be induced to pass a protective law that would really pro- 
tect these animals, and others also, from such purposeless and wanton destruction. 

"The final feature of this unique exhibit is a collection of ' weapons of destruc- 
tion,' which includes specimens of nearly all of the sporting rifles that have been 
used against American game, from the old Harpers Ferry flintlock down to the latest 
and deadliest patterns of repeating breech-loaders." 

The more important accessions received during the year were the 
following: 

Three American elk, or Wapiti (Cervus canadensis), a female and two 
males, presented by the Hon. W. F. Cody (" Buffalo Bill"). All three 
are adult, and in very fine condition. On June 8, 1889, the cow gave 
birth to a calf, which is doing finely and attracts much attention. 

Two young black bears, from Virginia, were received from Mr. J. S. 
Miller, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and placed iu the large hexa- 
gonal cage in the center of the closed building, 1 where their playful 
antics have furnished a constant source of amusement to visitors. 

A fine young gray wolf (Can is lupus (jriseo-albus) was received from 
Mr. C. A. Dole, Glendive, Montana, and its death during the winter 
was the most serious loss the collection sustained during the year. It 
is hoped that it may soon be replaced by another specimen of the 
same species. 

A very important accession, from the IT. S. Fish Commissioner, con- 
sisted of twelve elephant tortoises (Testudo elephantopus), of various 
sizes, from the Galapagos Islands, collected by the U. S. Fish Commis- 
sion steamer Albatross. A warm room for the special accommodation 
of these interesting reptiles was immediately built as an addition to 
the auimal house, and heated by a stove ; but in spite of the utmost 
care and attention a number of the tortoises died. 

Five very interesting monkeys were received during the year from 
various friends of the Museum, as follows: One Mexican spider 
monkey (Ateles vellerosus) from Mr. C. H. Townsend, one White-throated 
Capuchin (Cebus hypoleucus) from Mrs. H. D. Cook, jr., one White- 
fronted Cebus (Cebus albifrons) from Dr. S. P. Murray, one specimen of 
Cebus hypoleucus from Mr. Hubbard T. Smith, and another species of 
Cebus, from Uruguay, the gift of Senator J. T. Morgan. 

Four beautiful Angora goats were received from Misses Grace and 
Maude Parsons, Natural Bridge, Virginia, two of which have given 
birth to young. 

A young Prong horned antelope, from Texas, was received from Sen- 
ator Lelaud Stanford, but before it had fully recovered from the effects 
of its long journey it became alarmed at the presence of a stray dog 
close to the yard-fence, and in springing about the yard its head re- 
ceived an injury, from the effects of which it died a few days later, in 
spite of the best medical care. 

Two young Hod foxes were received from Mr. R. 15. L. Fleming, The 
Plains, Virginia ; a large swan (Cygnus columbianus) was presented by 



DEPARTMENT OF LIVING ANIMALS 421 

Masters Frank and Charles Drew; oi turtles and terra 

pins were received from the 5Tale< Jollege Museum, r 1 1 1 « > j i ^ 1 » Dr. G. Raur. 

Among the rare and specially interesting objects received, the most 
valuable prize was a young Rocky Mountain sheep, or Big Horn (Oris 
montana), female, from Mr. G-eorge Bird Grinnell, editor of the New 
York Forest and Stream. This interesting animal was captured in the 
mountains of northwestern Montana, by a Piegan Indian, in dune, 1888, 
and was procured from him by Mr. Grinnell, who conveyed it to the 
nearest railway, at very considerable trouble, in October of the same 
year. It arrived at the Museum in good condition, and has thriven as 
satisfactorily, and with as much rapidity, as any domestic lamb. In- 
asmuch as there is. so tar as known, only one other specimen of Oris 
montana in captivity, this individual is particularly interesting. It has 
been weighed, photographed, and measured at intervals, and its de- 
velopment carefully watched. In the issue of Forest and Stream for 
June C, 1884, there appeared a very interesting biographical sketch of 
this animal, by Mr. Grinnell, illustrated by a flue engraving from an 
instantaneous photograph by Mr. T. W. Smillie. It is confidently be- 
lieved that the Mountain sheep can be quite" successfully acclimated 
and bred in the climate of Washington, and experiments in that direc- 
tion will be made as soon as the Zoological Park is ready to accommo- 
date specimens. 

Among the other interesting rarities received were a Cacomistle, or 
" Civet ( 'at " (Jiassaris as tut a), from Mr. E. M. Hasbrouck ; two Mexican 
quails (Cyrtonyx) from Mr. B. J. Jones, Columbus, Ohio; a Wood rat 
{Keotoma floridana) from Mr. George W. Shutt; a Black-footed ferret 
(l'utorlus nigripes) from Mr. A. B. Baker, YVa Keeney, Kansas; three 
Mexican guans [Ortalis retain maccalli) from Capt. Henry Homey n, 
Fort Ringgold, Texas, and three Monkey-faced owls (Stri.c pratincola) 
from Mr. John T. Ward, Washington, District of Columbia. 

Several objects were received which, owing to their aquatic habits, it 
was found impossible to care for successfully in the absence of proper 
facilities for the care of aquatic birds. They were two Great northern 
divers (Colymbus torquatus), one swan (CygnuR columbi anus), one widgeon 
[Mareca amerieana), and a Ruffled grouse (Bonasa umbellus). In the 
autumn of 1889, the Hon. W. F. Cody offered to the Museum his entire 
heard of eighteen buffalos as a deposit, but it was impossible to accept 
them. In the same manner the Museum was offered, by Mr. W. A. 
Conklin, of New York, a camel, an aoudad, lioness, ibex, black leopard, 
and ostrich, all of which had to be declined. 

Dming the year a number of valuable American mammals were 
offered to the Museum at nominal prices, and although all of them would 
have been most welcome additions to the collections, it was absolutely 
necessary to decline them. They weir the following: Two specimens 
of manatee from Florida ; three specimens of moose from .Maine, Can- 
ada, and Minnesota; a Caribou from Maine, and three specimens of 



422 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, iss-j. 

Prong-horned antelope from Dakota. The loss of the manatee, moose, 
and caribou, all very rare in captivity, teas sincerely regretted. 

During the year the increase of the collection rendered it necessary to 
provide additional accommodations for animals of various kinds. A 
room 30 by 14 feet for tropical reptiles and quadrupeds was built on tbe 
north of the animal building as an addition to the latter. In this, which 
was heated by a stove, were accommodated the elephant tortoises, 
monkeys, turtles, terrapins, and alligators, and but for its warmth the 
monkeys could not have survived the winter. The limited space for 
visitors in this room has from the first been a serious drawback, inas- 
much as there is nearly always a crowd around the cages containing the 
monkeys, and the passage-way is very often completely blocked. 

On several occasions the crowd in the side room became so dense and 
the press so great, that it became necessary to clear the room and close 
it for a time. 

The grizzly bear and puma outgrew tlieir in-door quarters, and a large 
outdoor cage 8 feet square was made for each and placed at the edge 
of the lawn in front of the animal-house. In these the grizzly and puma 
are quite comfortable, and are in much better health than they have 
been before. Another large outdoor cage was made for the eagles and 
placed on the lawn near the deer-yards, and for the first time since the 
organization of the department these interesting birds are cared for 
under proper conditions. The buffalo-yard has been subdivided by 
cutting off a small section at one side to afford a yard for the Colum- 
bian black-tail deer, which, during the rutting season, became so vicious 
and dangerous that it was necessary to isolate him entirely. One of 
the deer-yards was also divided into two, to furnish a separate yard for 
the Mountain sheep. 

Owing to the small size of all the yards, great difficulty was experi- 
enced during the rutting season in so isolating the bucks of all species 
as to prevent their fighting and seriously injuring each other. Of the 
large animals, the buffalos have proven to be the easiest to manage, 
and the most satisfactory of all the ruminants. It is also to be noted 
that they are in fine condition. 

Several new and more comfortable cages were fitted up in the closed 
building for the raccoons, opossums, snakes, owls, etc. Printed labels 
were provided to accompany specimens as soon as possible after their 
receipt, and while the general system of labeling has been far short of 
what it should be, and has not been even a suggestion of the possibili- 
ties in that direction, it was the best that could be done under the cir- 
cumstances. In the matter of routine work in the care of the collec- 
tions, it would be impossible to speak too highly in praise of Mr. W. 0. 
AVeedeu, keeper, and Mr. Selmon Cook, assistant, both of whom have 
always beeu untiring in their efforts to keep the animals in good condi- 
tion and to make the entire collection as attractive as possible, even 
though laboring under the serious disadvantages of temporary and very

limited accommodations. They have been on dutj every holiday in 
order to keep the collection open to the crowds of visitors always in 
attendance on such occasions, and are always on duty part of the day 
on Sunday to look after the comfort of the animals in their charge. 

Unlike all the other departments of the Museum, this contains neither 
a reserve nor duplicate series of specimens, but an exhibition scries 
only, which embraces all the living creatures on hand at any given time. 
Specimens lost by death are immediately transferred to the other de- 
partments of the Museum, according to their respective wants, being 
divided between the departments of comparative anatomy, mammals, 
birds, and reptiles. 

The total number of living specimens received during the year was 
271, of which 12(5 were gifts, 37 were deposited, and 8 were purchased. 
The last catalogue entry on June 30, 18S9, was 341, which represents 
the total number of specimens received since the collection was begun.

THE MUSEUMS OF THE FUTURE,' 



By <;. Brown Goode, LL. 1>. 



There is an Oriental saying that the distance between car and eye is 
small, but the difference between hearing and seeing very great. 

More terse and not less forcible is our own proverb, "To see is to 
know." which expresses a growing tendency in the human mind. 

In this busy, critical, and skeptical age, each man is seeking to know 
all things, and life is too short for many words. The eye is used more 
and more, the ear less and less, and in the use of the eye, descriptive 
writing is set aside for pictures, and pictures in their turn are replaced 
by actual objects. In the school-room the diagram, the blackboard, and 
the object-lesson, unknown thirty years ago, are universally employed. 
The public lecturer uses the stereopticon to re-enforce his words, the 
editor illustrates his journals and magazines with engravings a. hun- 
dred-fold more numerous and elaborate than his predecessor thought 
needful, and the merchant and manufacturer recommend their wares 
by means of vivid pietographs. The local fair of old has grown into 
the great exposition, often international and always under some gov- 
ernmental patronage, and thousands of such have taken place within 
forty years, from Japan to Tasmania, and from Norway to Brazil. 

Amid such tendencies, the museum, it would seem, should find con- 
genial place, for it is the most powerful and useful auxiliary of all sys- 
tems of teaching by means of object lessons. 

The work of organizing museums has not kept pace with the times. 
The United States is far behind the spirit of its own people, and less 
progressive than England, Germany, Frauce, Italy, or Japan. We 
have, it is true, two or three centers of great activity in museum work, 
but there have been few new ones established within twenty years, and 
many of the old are in a state of torpor. This can not long continue. 
The museum of the past must be set aside, reconstructed, transformed 
from a cemetery of bric-a-brac into a nursery of living thoughts. The 
museum of the future must stand side by side with the library and the 
laboratory, as a pari of the teaching equipment of the college and uni- 
versity, and in the great cities co-operate with the public binary as one 
of the principal agencies for the enlightenment of the people.

428 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The true significance of the word museum may best be appreciated 
through an allusion to the ages which preceded its origin— when our 
ancestors, hundreds of generations removed, were in the midst of those 
great migrations which peopled Europe with races originally seated in 
Central Asia. 

It, has been well said that the early history of Greece is the first chap- 
ter in the political and intellectual life of Europe. To the history of 
Greece let us go for the origin of the museum idea, which, in its present 
form, seems to have found its only congenial home among the European 
offshoots of the great Indo-Germanic or Aryan division of the world's 
inhabitants. Long centuries before the invention of written languages 
there lived along the borders of northern Greece, upon the slopes of 
Mount Olympus and Helicon, a people whom the later Greeks called 
"Thracians," a half-mythical race, whose language even has perished. 
They survived in memory, we are told, as a race of bards, associated 
with that peculiar legendary poetry of pre-Homeric date, in which the 
powers of nature were first definitely personified. This poetry belonged, 
presumably, to an age when the ancestors of the Greeks had left their 
Indo-European home, but had not yet taken full possession of the lands 
which were afterward Hellenic. The spirits of nature sang to their 
sensitive souls with the voice of brook aud tree and bird, and each 
agency or form which their senses perceived was personified in connec- 
tion with a system of worship. There were spirits in every forest or 
mountain, but in Thrace alone dwelt the Muses — the spirits who know 
and who remember, who are the guardians of all wisdom, and who im- 
part to their disciples the knowledge and the skill to write. 

Museums, in the language of Ancient Greece, were the homes of the 
Muses. The first were in the groves of Parnassus and Helicon, and 
later they were temples in various parts of Helles. Soon, however, 
the meaning of the word changed, and it was used to describe a place 
of study, or a school. Atheuseus in the second century described 
Athens as " the museum of Greece," and the name was applied to that 
portion of the palace of Alexandria which was set apart for the study 
of the sciences aud which contained the famous Alexandrian library. 
The museum of Alexandria, was a great university, the abiding place 
of men of science aud letters, who were divided into many companies 
or colleges, for the support of each of which a handsome revenue was 
allotted. 

The Alexandrian museum was burned in the days of Caesar and 
Aurelian, and the term museum, as applied "to a great public institu- 
tion, dropped out of use from the fourth to the seventeenth century. 
The disappearance of a word is an indication that the idea for which it 
stood had also fallen into disfavor, and such, indeed, was the fact. 

The history of museum and library runs in parallel lines. It is not 
until the development of the arts aud sciences has taken place, until an 
extensive written literature has grown up, and a distinct literary and 



THE MUSEUMS OF THE FUTURE. 429 

scientific class has been developed, that it is possible for the modern 
library and museum to come into existence. The museum of the pres- 
ent is more unlike its old-time representative, than is our library un- 
like its prototype. 

There were, in the remote past, galleries of pictures and sculpture as 
well as museums, so-called. Fublic collections of paintings and stat- 
uary were founded in Greece and Rome at a very early day. There was 
a gallery of paintings (Pinacotheea) in one of the marble halls of the 
Propylaeuui at Athens, and in Rome there was a lavish public display of 
works of art. 

M. Dezohry, in his brilliant wink upon "Rome in the time of Augus- 
tus" 1 [Home an .sieele d'Auguste), described this phase of the Latin 
civilization in the first century before Christ. 

" P'or many years," remarks one of his characters, " the taste for 
paintings has been extending in a most extraordinary manner. In for- 
mer times they were only to be found in the temples, where they were 
placed, less for purposes of ornament than as an act of homage to the 
gods; now they are everywhere, not only in temples, in private houses, 
and in public halls, but also on outside walls, exposed freely to air and 
sunlight. Rome is one great picture gallery ; the Forum of Augustus 
is gorgeous with paintings, and they may be seen also in the Forum of 
Caesar, in the Roman Forum, under the peristyles of many of the tem- 
ples, and especially in the porticoes used for public promenades, some 
of which are literally filled with them. Thus everybody is enabled to 
enjoy them, and to enjoy them at all hours of the day." 

The public men of Rome at a later period in its history were no less 
mindful of the claims of art. They believed that the metropolis of a 
great nation should be adorned with all the best products of civiliza- 
tion. We are told by Pliny that when Caesar was dictator, he purchased 
for 300,000 deuiers two Greek paintings, which he caused to be pub- 
licly displayed, and that Agrii a placed many costly works of art in 
a hall which he built and bequeathed to the Roman people. Constan- 
tino gathered together in Constantinople the paintings and sculptures 
of the great masters, so that the city before its destruction became a 
great museum like Rome. 

The taste for works of art was in the days of the ancient civiliza- 
tions generally prevalent throughout the whole Mediterranean region, 
and there is abundant reason to believe that there were prototypes of 
the modern museum in Persia, Assyria, Babylonia, and Egypt, as well 
as in Home. 

Collections in natural history also undoubtedly existed, though we 
have no positive descriptions of them. Natural curiosities, of course, 
found their way into the private collections of monarch s, and were 
doubtless also in use for study among the savants in the Alexandrian 
museums. Aristotle, in the fourth cent nrj he fori' Christ, had. il is said, 
an enormous grant of money for use in his scientific researches, aud 



430 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



Alexander the Great, his patron, "took care to send to him a great 
variety of zoological specimens, collected in the countries which he had 
subdued," and also "placed at his disposal several thousand persons, 
who were occupied in hunting, fishing, and making the observations 
which were necessary for completing his History of Animals." If 
human nature has not changed more than we suppose, Aristotle must 
have had a great museum of natural history. 

When the Roman capital was removed to Byzantium, the arts and 
letters of Europe began to decline. The Church was un propitious, aud 
the invasions of the northern barbarians destroyed everything. In 
476, with the close of the Western Empire, began a period of intellect- 
ual torpidity which was to last for a thousand years. It was in Bagdad 
and Cordova that science and letters were next to be revived, and 
Africa was to surpass Europe in the exhibit of its libraries. 

With the Renaissance came a period of new life for collectors. The 
churches of southern Europe became art galleries, and monarchs aud 
noblemen and ecclesiastical dignitaries collected books, manuscripts, 
sculptures, pottery, and gems, forming the begiuniugs of collections 
which have since grown into public museums. Some of these collec- 
tions doubtless had their first beginnings in the midst of the Dark 
Ages within the walls of feudal castles or the larger monasteries, but 
their number was small, and they must have consisted chiefly of those 
objects so nearly akin to literature as especially to command the atten- 
tion of bookish men. 

The idea of a great national museum of science and art was first 
worked out by Lord Bacon in his "New Atlantis," a philosophical 
romance published at the close of the seventeenth century. 

The first scientific museum actually founded was that begun at Ox- 
ford, in 1667, by Elias Ashmole, still kno^vn as the Ashmolean Museum, 
composed chiefly of natural history specimens collected by the botan- 
ists Tradescant, father and son, in Vir^ nia aud in the north of Africa. 
Soon after, in 1753, the British Museum was established by act of Par- 
liament, inspired by the will of Sir Hans Sloane, who, dying in 1719, 
left to the nation his invaluable collection of books, manuscripts, aud 
curiosities. 

Many of the great national museums of Europe had their origin in 
the private collections of monarchs. France claims the honor of having 
been the first to change a royal into a national museum, when in 1789, 
the Louvre came into the possession of a republican government. 

It is very clear, however, that democratic England stands several dec- 
ades in advance — its act, moreover, being one of deliberate founding 
rather than a species of conquest. A ceutury before this, when Charles 
the First was beheaded by order of Parliament, his magnificent private 
collection was dispersed, What a blessing it would be to England to-day 
if the idea of founding a national museum had beeu suggested to the 
Cromwelliaus. The intellectual life of America is so closely bound to 



THE MUSEUMS OF THE FUTURE. 431 

that of England, that tbe revival of interest in museums, aud in popular 
education, at the middle of the present century, is especially significant 
to us. 

The Great Exhibition of 1851 was one of the most striking features 
of tbe industrial revolution in England, that great transformation 
which, following closely upon the introduction of railroads, turned 
England feudal and agricultural, into England democratic and com- 
mercial. This Exhibition marked an epoch in the intellectual progress 
of English speaking peoples. " The Great Exhibition," writes a popular 
novelist — a social philosopher as well — " did one great service for 
country people : It taught them bow easy it is to get to London, aud 
what a mine of wealth, especially for after-memory and purposes of 
conversation, exists in that great place." 

Our own Centennial Exhibition in 1876 was almost as great a revela- 
tion to tbe people of the United States. The thoughts of the country 
were opened to many things before undreamed of. One thing we may 
regret — that we have no such wide-spread system of museums as that 
which has developed in tbe motherland, with South Kensington as its 
administrative center. 

ruder the wise administration of the South Keusiugton staff, an out- 
growth of the events of 1851, a great system of educational museums 
has been developed all through the United Kingdom. A similar exten- 
sion of public museums in this country would be quite in harmony with 
the spirit of the times, as shown in the present efforts toward university 
extensions. 

England has had nearly forty years in which to develop these tend- 
encies, and we but thirteen since our Exhibition. May we not hope 
that within a like period of time and before the year 1914, the United 
States may have attained the position which England now occupies, at 
least in the respect of popular interest and substantial governmental 
support. 

There are now over one hundred aud fifty public museums in the 
United Kingdom, all active and useful. The museum systems of Great 
Britain are, it seems to me, much closer to the ideal which America 
should follow than are those of either France or Germany. They are 
designed more thoughtfully to meet tin- needs of the people, and are 
more intimately intertwined with the policy of national, popular edu- 
cation. Sir Henry Cole, the founder of the "Department of Science 
and Art," speaking of the purpose of the museum under his care, said 
to the people of Birmingham in 1874: "If you wish your schools of 
.science and art to be effective, your health, the air, and your food to 
be wholesome, your life to be long, your manufactures to improve, 
your trade to increase, and your people to be civilized, you must have 
museums of science and art, to illustrate the principles of life, health, 
nature, science, art, and beauty. 

Again, in words u> applicable i" America <>f today as to Britain 



432 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

in 1874, said he: "A thorough education and a knowledge of science 
and art are vital to the nation aud to the place it holds at present in 
the civilized world. Science and art are the life-blood *of successful 
production. All civilized nations are running a race with us, and our 
national decline will date from the period when we goto sleep over the 
work of education, science, and art. What has been done is at the 
mere threshold of the work yet to be done." 

The museums of the future in this democratic land should be adapted 
to the needs of the mechanic, the factory operator, the day laborer, 
the salesman, and the clerk, as much as to those of the professional 
man and the man of leisure. It is proper that there be laboratories and 
professional libraries for the development of the experts who are to or- 
ganize, arrange and explain the museums. It is proper that the labora- 
tories be utilized to the fullest extent for the credit of the institution to 
which they belong. No museum can grow and be respected which does 
not each year give additional proofs of its claims to be considered a 
center of learning. 

On the other hand the public have a right to ask that much shall be 
done directly in their interest. They will gladly allow the museum 
officer to use part of his time in study and experiment. They will take 
pride in the possession by the museum of tens of thousands of speci- 
mens, interesting only to the specialists, hidden away perpetually from 
public view, but necessary for purpose of scientific research. These are 
foundations of the intellectual superstructure which gives the institu- 
tion its standing. 

Still no pains must be spared in the presentation of the material in 
the exhibition halls. The specimens must be prepared in the most care- 
ful and artistic manner, and arranged attractively in well-designed 
cases and behind the clearest of glass. Each object must bear a label, 
giving its name and history so fully that all the probable questions of 
the visitor are answered in advance. Books of reference must be kept 
in convenient places. Colors of walls, cases, and labels must be restful 
and quiet, and comfortable seats should be everywhere accessible, for 
the task of the museum visitor is a weary one at best. 

In short, the public museum is, first of all, for the benefit of the pub- 
lic. When the officers are few in number, each must of necessity de- 
vote a considerable portion of his time to the public halls. When the 
staff becomes larger, it is possible by specialization of work to arrange 
that certain men may devote their time uninterruptedly to laboratory 
work, while others are engaged in the increase of the collections and 
their installation. 

I hope and firmly believe that every American community with in- 
habitants to the number of five thousand or more will within the next 
half century have a public library, under the management of a trained 
librarian. Be it ever so small, its influence upon the people would be 
of untold value. One of tin 1 saddest things in this life is to realize 



THE MUSEUMS OF THE FUTURE. 433 

that in the death of the elder members of a community, so much that 
is precious in the way of knowledge and experience is lost to the world. 
It is through the agency of books that mankind benefits by the toil of 
past generations and is able to avoid their errors. 

In these days, when printing is cheap aud authors are countless, that 
which is good aud true in human thought is in danger of being entirely 
overlooked. The daily papers, and above all the overgrown and un- 
canny Sunday papers, are like weeds in a garden whose rank leaves 
not only consume the resources of the soil but hide from view the more 
modest and more useful plants of slower growth. 

Most suggestive may we hud an essay on " Capital aud Culture in 
America " which recently appeared in one of the English reviews. The 
author, a well known Anglo- American astronomer, boldly asserts that 
year by year it becomes clearer that despite the large increase in the 
number of men and women of culture in America, the nation is deteri- 
orating in regard to culture. Among five hundred towns where form- 
erly courses of varied entertainments worthy of civilized communities — 
concerts, readings, lectures on artistic, literary, and scientific subjects, 
and so forth were successfully arranged season after season, scarcely 
fifty now feel justified in continuing their efforts in the cause of culture, 
knowing that the community will not support them. Scientific, liter- 
ary, and artistic societies, formerly flourishing, are now dying or dead 
in many cities which have in the meantime increased in wealth and 
population." He instances Chicago as typical of an important portion 
of America, and cites evidences of decided deteriraotoin within sixteen 
years. 

The people's museum should be much more than a house full of speci- 
mens in glass cases. It should be a house full of ideas, arranged with 
the strictest attention to system. 

I once tried to express this thought by saying " An efficient educational 
museum may he described as a collection of instructive labels, each illus- 
trated by « /nil-selected specimen." 

The museum, let me add, should be more than a collection of speci- 
mens well arranged and well labeled. Like the library, it should lie 
under the constant supervision of one or more men well informed, schol- 
arly and withal practical, and fitted by tastes and training to aid in the 
educational work. 

I should not organize the museum primarily for the use of the people 
in their larval or school-going stage of existence. The public school 
teacher with the illustrated text-book, diagrams, and other appliances, 
is in these days a professional outfit which is usually quite sufficient to 
enable liim to teach his pupils. School days last at the most only from 
\\\^ to fifteen years, and they end with the majority of mankind before 
their minds have reached the stage of growth most favorable for the 
reception and assimilation ofthebesl and most useful thought. Why 

should we be crammed in the times of infancy and kept in a stale of

434 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

mental starvation during the period which follows, from maturity to 
old age, a state which is disheartening and unnatural, all the more 
because of the intellectual tastes which have been stimulated and par- 
tially formed by school life. 

The boundary line between the library and the museum is neither 
straight nor plain. The former, if its scope be rightly indicated by its 
name, is primarily a place for books. The latter is a depository for ob- 
jects of every kind, books not excepted. 

The British Museum, with its libraries, its pictures, its archaeological 
galleries, its anthropological, geological, botanical, and zoological col- 
lections, is an example of the most comprehensive interpretation of the 
term. 

Professor Huxley has described the museum as "a consultative 
library of objects." This definition is suggestive but unsatisfactory. 
It relates only to the contents of the museum, as distinguished from 
those of the library, and makes no reference to the differences in the 
methods of their administration. The treasures of the library must be 
examined one at a time and by one person at a time; their use requires 
long-continued attention, and their removal from their proper places in 
the system of arrangement. Those of the museum are displayed to 
public view, in groups, in systematic sequence, so that they have a 
collective as well as an individual significance. Furthermore, much of 
their meaning may be read at a glance. 

The museum cultivates the powers of observation, and the casual 
visitor even makes discoveries for himself and under the guidance of 
the labels forms his own impressions. In the library one studies the 
impressions of others. The library is most useful to the educated, the 
museum to educated and uneducated alike, to the masses as well as to 
the few, and is a powerful stimulant to intellectual activity in either 
class. The influence of the museum upon a community is not so deep 
as that of the library, but extends to a much larger number of people. 

The National Museum has 300,000 visitors a year, each of whom car- 
ries away a certain number of new thoughts. 

The two ideas may be carried out, side by side, in the same building, 
and if need be under the same management, not only without antago- 
nism, but with advantage. 

That the proximity of a good library is absolutely essential to the 
usefulness of a museum will be admitted by every one. 

I am confident also that a museum, wisely organized and properly 
arranged, is certain to benefit the library near which it stands in many 
ways through its power to stimulate interest in books, thus increasing 
the general popularity of the library and enlarging its endowment. 

Many books and valuable ones would be required in the first kind of 
museum work, but it is not intended to enter into competition with the 
library. (When necessary, volumes could be duplicated.) Tt is very 
often the case, however, that books are more useful and safer in the 



THE MUSEUMS OF THE ITTl RE 135 

museum than on the library shelves, for in the museum thej may be 
seen daily by thousands, while in the library their very existence is 
forgotten by all except their custodian. 

Audubon's " Birds of North America" is a book which every one has 
heard oi' and which every one wants to see at least once in his lifetime. 
In a library, it probably is uot examined by ten persons in a year; in 
a museum, the volumes exposed to view in a glass case, a few of the 
most striking plates attractively framed and hung upon the wall near 
at hand, it teaches a lesson to every passer-by. 

The library may be called upon for aid by the museum in many di- 
rections. Pictures are often better than specimens to illustrate certain 
ideas. The races of man and their distribution can only be shown by 
pictures and maps. Atlases of ethnological portraits and maps are out 
of place in a library if there is a museum near by in which they can be 
displayed. They are not even members of the class described by Lamb 
as •• books which are not books". They are not books, but museum 
specimens masquerading in the dress of books. 

There is another kind of depository which, though in external fea- 
tures so similar to the museum, and often confused with it in name as 
well as in thought, is really very unlike it. This is the art gallery. 
The scientific tendencies of modern thought have permeated every de- 
partment of human activity, even influencing the artist. Many art 
galleries are now called museums, and the assumption of the name 
usually tends toward the adoption in some degree of a scientific 
method of installation. The difference between a museum and a gal- 
lery is solely one of method of management. The Musee des Thermes, 
the Cluny Museum in Paris is, notwithstanding its name, simply a gal- 
lery of (anions objects. Its contents are arranged primarily with ref- 
erence to their effect. The old monastery in which they are placed, 
affords a magnificent example of the interior decorative art of the Mid- 
dle Ages. 

The Cluny Museum is a most fascinating and instructive place. 1 
would not have it otherwise than it is, but it will always be unique, 
the sole representative of its kind. The features which render it at- 
tractive would be ruinous to any museum. It is, more than any other 
that 1 know, a collection arrauged from the stand-point of the artist. 
The same material, in the hands of a Klennn or a Pitt Kivers, arranged 
to show the history of human thought, would, however, be much more 
interesting, and, if the work were judiciously done, would lose none of 
its aesthetic allurements. 

Another collection of the same general character as the one just de- 
scribed is the Soane Museum in London. Another, the famous collec 
tion of crown jewels and metal work in the Green Vaults al Dresden, 
i counterparl of which maj he cited in the collection in the Tower of 

London. Che .Museum of the I lolieii/.ollerns in Berlin and the .Museum 
Of the Oity Of Paris are Of necessity Unique. Such collections can not

be created. They grow in obedience to the action of natural law, just 
as a tree or a sponge may grow. 

The city which is in the possession of such an heirloom is blessed 
just as is the possessor of an historic surname, or he who inherits the 
cumulative genius of generations of gifted forefathers. The possession 
of one or a score of such shrines does not, however, free any community 
from the obligation to form a museum for purposes of education and sci- 
entific research. 

The founding of a public museum in a city like Brooklyn, is a work 
whose importance can scarcely be overestimated. The founders of in- 
stitutions of this character do not often realize how much they are doing 
for the future. Opportunity such as that which is now open to the 
members of the Brooklyn Institute occur only once in the lifetime of a 
nation. It is by no means improbable that the persons now in this room 
have it in their power to decide whether in the future intellectual prog- 
ress of this nation, Brooklyn is to lead or to follow far in the rear. 

Many of my hearers are doubtless familiar with that densely popu- 
lated wilderness, the east end of London, twice as large as Brooklyn, 
yet with scarce an intellectual oasis in its midst. Who can say how 
differeut might have been its condition today if Walter Besant's apos- 
tolic labors had begun a century sooner, and if the People's Palace, 
that wonderful materialization of a poet's dream, had been for three 
generations brightening the lives of the citizens of the Lower Hamlets 
and Hackney. 

Libraries and museums do not necessarily spring up where they are 
needed. Our governments, Federal, State, and municipal, are not 
"paternal " in spirit. They are less so even in practical working than 
in England, when, notwithstanding the theory that all should be left to 
private effort, the government, under the leadership of the late Prince 
Consort and of the Prince of Wales, has done wonderful things for all 
the provincial cities, as well as for London, in the encouragement of 
libraries, museums, art, and industrial education. 

However much the state may help, the private individual must lead, 
organize, and prepare the way. " It is universally admitted," said the 
Marquis of Lansdowne in 1847, "that governments are the worst of 
cultivators, the worst of manufacturers, the worst of traders," and Sir 
Kobert Peel said in similar strain that "the action of government is tor- 
pid at best." 

In beginning a museum the endowment is of course the most essen- 
tial thing, especially in a great city like Brooklyn, which has a high 
ideal of what is due to the intelligence ot its populace and to the civic 
dignity. 

Unremunerated service in museum administration, though it maybe 
enthusiastically offered and conscientiously performed, will in the end 
fail to be satisfactory. Still more is it impossible for a respectable 



THE MUSEUMS OF THE FUTURE. 4P>7 

museum to grow up without liberal expenditure for th< acquisition of 
collections and their installation. 

Good administration is not to be had for nothing. As to the qualifica- 
tion of a museum administrator, whether it l>e for a museum of science 
or a museum of art, it is perhaps superfluous to say that he should be 
the very best obtainable; a man of ability, enthusiasm, and withal of 
experience, for the administration of museums and exhibitions has be- 
come of late years a profession, and careful study of methods of ad- 
ministration is indispensable. If the new administrator has not had 
experience he must needs gain it at the expense of the establishment 
which employes him — an expense of which delay, waste, and needless 
experiment form considerable elements. 

No investment is more profitable to a museum than that in the salary 
fund. Around a nucleus of men of established reputation and adminis- 
trative tact, will naturally grow up a staff of volunteer assistants, whose 
work, assisted and directed in the best channels, will be of infinite value. 

The sinews and brains of the organism being first provided, the de- 
velopment of its body still remains. The outer covering, the dress, can 
wait. It is much better to hire buildings for temporary use, or to build 
rude lire-proof sheds, than to put up a permanent museum building be- 
fore at least a provisional idea of its personnel and contents has been 
acquired. 

As has been already said, a museum must spend money in the acquisi- 
tion of collections, and a great deal of money. The British Museum 
lias already cost the nation for establishment and maintenance not far 
from s.;o.O00,000. Up to 1882 over $1,500,000 had been expended in 
purchase of objects for the art collections at South Kensington alone. 

Such expenditures are usually good investments of national funds, 
however. In 1882, after about twenty-five years of experience, the 
buildings and contents of the South Kensington Museum had cost the 
nation about $5,000,000, but competent authorities were satisfied that 
an auction on the premises could not bring less than $100,000,000. For 
• very dollar spent, however, gifts will come in to the value of many 
dollars. In this connection it may not be amiss to quote the words of 
oik; of the most experienced of English museum administrators (pre- 
sumably Sir Philip Ounliffe Owen) when asked many years ago whether 
Americans might not develop great public institutions on the plan of 
those at Kensington : 

• Let them plant the thing,'" he said, "and it can't help growing, and 
most likeh beyond their powers — as it has been almost beyond ours — 
to keep up with it. What is wanted first of all is one or two good 
brains, with the means of erecting a good building on a piece of ground 
considerably larger than is required for that building. Where there 
have been secured substantial, luminous galleries for exhibition, in a 
fire-proof building, and these arc known to be carefully guarded by 
night and day, there can be no need to wait long for treasures to flow 



438 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1880. 

into it. Above all, let your men take care of the interior and not set out 
wasting their strength and money on external grandeur and decoration. 
The inward built up rightly, the outward will be added in due season.' 1 * 

Much will, of course, be given to any museum which has the confi- 
dence of the public — much that is of great value, and much that is use- 
less. 

The Trojans of old distrusted the Greeks when they came bearing 
gifts. The museum administrator must be on his guard against every 
one who proffers gifts. An unconditional donation may be usually 
accepted without hesitation, but a gift coupled with conditions is, 
except in very extraordinary cases, far from a benefaction. 

A donor demands that his collection shall be exhibited as a whole, 
and kept separate from all others. When his collection is monographic 
in character and very complete, it is sometimes desirable to accept it 
on such conditions. As a rule, however, it is best to try to induce the 
donor to allow his collections to be merged in the general series — each 
object being separately and distinctively labeled. I would not be under- 
stood to say that the gift of collections is not, under careful manage- 
ment, a most beneficial source of increase to a public collection. I 
simply wish to call attention to the fact that a museum which accepts 
without reserve gifts of every description, and fails to re-enforce these 
gifts by extensive and judicious purchasing, is certain to develop in 
au un systematical and ill-balanced way. 

Furthermore, unless a museum be supported by liberal and constantly 
increasing grants from some State or muuicipial treasury, it will ulti- 
mately become suffocated. It is essential that every museum, whether 
of science or art should from the start make provision for laboratories 
and storage galleries as well as for exhibition halls. 

All intellectual work may be divided into two classes, the one tending 
towards the increase of knowledge, the other towards its diffusion— the 
one toward investigation and discovery, the other toward the education 
of the people and the application of known facts to promoting their 
material welfare. The efforts of learned men are sometimes applied 
solely to one of these departments of effort — sometimes to both, and it 
is generally admitted by the most advanced teachers, that for their stu- 
dents as well as for themselves, the happiest results are reached by in- 
vestigation and instruction simultaneously. Still more is this true of 
institutions of learning. The college which imparts only second-hand 
knowledge to its students belongs to a stage of civilization which is fast 
being left behiud. The museum likewise must, in order to perform its 
proper functions, contribute to the advancement of learning through 
the increase as well as through the diffusion of knowledge. 

We speak of educational museums and of the educational method of 
installation so frequently that there may be danger of inconsistency in 
the use of the term. An educational museum, as it is usually spoken 



Conway : Travels in South Kensington, 26. 



THE MUSEUMS OF THE FUTURE. 43!) 

of, is one in which an attempt is made to teach the unprofessional vis- 
itor; an institution for popular education by means of labeled collec- 
tions, and it may be also by popular lectures. A college museum, al- 
though used as an aid to advanced instruction, is not an "educational 
museum" in the ordinary sense; nor does a museum of research, like 
the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Mass., belong to 
this class, although to a limited extent it attempts and performs pop- 
ular educational work in addition to its other functions. 

In the National Museum in Washington the collections are divided 
into two great classes. The exhibition series, which constitutes the 
educational portion of the Museum, and is exposed to public view with 
all possible accessions for public entertainment and instruction, and 
the study series, which is kept in the scientific laboratories, and is 
scarcely examined except by professional investigators. 

In every properly conducted museum the collections must from the 
very beginning divide themselves into these two classes, and in plan, 
ning for its administration provision should be made not only for the 
exhibition of objects in glass cases, but for the preservation of large 
collections not available for exhibition, to be used for the studies of a 
very limited number of specialists. 

Lord Bacon, who, as we have noticed, was the first to whom occurred 
the idea of a great museum of science and art, complained three cen- 
turies ago, in his book " On the Advancement of Learning," that up to 
that time the means for intellectual progress had been used exclusively 
for "amusement" and " teaching," and not for the "augmentation of 
science." 

It will undoubtedly be found desirable for certain museums, founded 
for local effect, to specialize mainly in the direction of popular educa- 
tion. If they can not also provide for a certain amount of scholarly 
endeavor in connection with the other advantages, it would be of the 
utmost importance that they should be assorted by a system of adminis- 
trative co-operation with some institution which is in the position of 
being a center of original work. 

The general character of museums should be clearly determined at 
its very inception. Specialization and division of labor are essential 
for institutions as well as for individuals. It is only a great national 
museum which can hope to include all departments, and which can with 
safety encourage growth in every direction. 

A city museum, even in a great metropolis like Brooklyn, should, if 
possible, select certain special lines of activity, and pursue them with 
the intention of excelling. If there are already beginnings in many 
directions, it is equally necessary to decide which lines of development 
;i i e to be favored, in preference to all others. Many museums fail to 
make this choice at the start, and instead of Steering toward some 
definite point, drift hither and thither, and, it may be, are foundered 
in mid-ocean. 



440 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

There is no reason why the museum of the Brooklyn Institute may 
not in time attain to world-wide fame, and attract students and visitors 
from afar. It would be wise perhaps in shaping its policy to remember 
that in the twin city of New York are two admirable museums which 
may be met more advantageously in co-operation than in rivalry. 
Brooklyn may appropriately have its own museum of art and its 
museum of natural history, but they should avoid the repetition of 
collections already so near at hand. 

In selecting courses for the development of a museum, it may be 
useful to consider what are the fields open to museum work. 

As a matter of convenience museums are commonly classed in two 
groups — those of science and those of art, and in Great Britain the 
great national system is mainly under the control of "The Science and 
Art Department of the Committee of Council on Education." 

The classification is not entirely satisfactory since it is based upon 
methods of arrangement, rather than upon the nature of the ob- 
jects to be arranged, and since it leaves a middle territory (only 
partially occupied by the English museum men of either department), 
a great mass of museum material of the greatest moment both in re- 
gard to its interest and its adaptability for purposes of public in- 
struction. 

On the one side stand the natural history collections, undoubtedly 
best to be administrated by the geologist, botanist, and zoologist. On 
the other side are the fine art collections, best to be arranged from an 
aesthetic standpoint, by artists. Between is a territory which no 
English word can adequately describe — which the Germans call Cnl- 
turgeschichte — the natural history of cult, or civilization, of man and 
his ideas and achievements. The museums of science and art have 
not yet learned how to partition this territory. An exact classification 
of museums is not at present practicable, nor will it be, until there has 
been some redistribution of the collections which they contain. It may 
be instructive however, to pass in review the principal museums of the 
world, indicating briefly their chief characteristics. 

Every great nation has its museum of nature. The natural history 
department of the British Museum, recently removed from the heart 
of London to palatial quarters in South Kensington, is probably the 
most extensive — with its three great divisions, zoological, botanical, 
and geological. The Musee d'Histoire Naturelle, in the garden of plants 
in Paris, founded in 1795, with its galleries of anatomy, anthropology, 
zoology, botany, mineralogy, and geology, is one of the most extensive, 
but far less potent in science now than in the days of Cuvier, Lamarck, 
St. Hilaire, Jussieu, and Brougniart. In Washington, again, there is a 
National Museum with anthropological, zoological, botanical, mineral- 
ogical, and geological collections in one organization, together with a 
large additional department of arts and industries, or technology. 

Passing to specialized natural history collections, perhaps the most

note worth 3 are those devoted to zoology, and chief among them that 
in our own American Cambridge. The Museum of Comparative Xool- 
ogy, founded l>y the Agassiz's, "to illustrate the history of creation, 
as far as the present state of knowledge reveals that history," was in 
1887, pronounced by the English naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace, 
"to be far in advance of similar institutions in Europe as an educational 
institution, whether as regards the general public, the private student, 
or the specialist." 

Next to Cambridge, after the zoological section of the museums of 
London and Paris, stands the collections in the Imperial Cabinet in 
Vienna, and those of the zoological museums in Berlin, Ley den, Copen- 
hagen, and Christiania. 

Among botanical museums, that in the Royal Gardens at Kew, near 
Loudon, is pre-eminent, with its colossal herbarium containing the 
finest collection in the world, aud its special museum of economic botany 
founded in 1847, both standing m the midst of a collection of living 
plants. There is also in Berlin the Koyal liotanical Museum, founded 
in 1818 as the Royal Herbarium ; in St. Petersburg, the Herbaria of 
the Imperial Botanical Garden. 

Among the geological and mineralogical collections the mineral 
cabinet in Vienna, arranged in the imperial castle, is among the first. 

The Museum of Practical Geology in London, which is attached to 
the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom, was founded in 1837, to 
exhibit the collections of the survey, in order to " show the applications 
of geology to the useful purposes of life." Like every other healthy 
museum, it soon had investigations in progress in connection with its 
educational work, and many very important discoveries have been made 
in its laboratories. It stands in the very first rank of museums for pop- 
ular instruction, the arrangement of the exhibition halls being most 
admirable. Of museums of anatomy there are thirty of considerable 
magnitude, all of which have grown up in connection with schools of 
medicine aud surgery, except' the magnificent Army Medical Museum 
in Washington. 

The Medical Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in London is 
probably first in importance. The collections of St. Thomas's, Guy's, 
St. George's, and other hospitals are very rich in anatomical and path- 
ological specimens. The oldest public anatomical museum in London is 
that of St. Bartholomew's. 

Paris, Edinburgh, and Dublin have large anatomical and materia- 
medica collections. Asa rule, the medical museums of Europe are con 
nected with universities. Dr. Billings, Curator of the Army Medical 
museum in Washington, has traced accurately the growth of medical 
collections both at home and abroad, and from his address upon med- 
ical museums, aspresident of the Congress of American Physicians and 
Surgeons, delivered in 1888, the facts here stated relating to this class 
of museums have been gathered. The Army Medical Museum appar- 



442 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

ently owes its establishment to Dr. William A. Hammond, in 1862. The 
museum contained in 1888 more that 15,000 specimens, besides those 
contained in the microscopical department. "An ideal medical museum," 
says Dr. Billings, "should be very complete in the department of pre- 
ventive medicine or hygiene. It is a wide field, covering, as it does, 
air, water, food, clothing, habitations, geology, meteorology, occupations, 
etc., in their relations to the production or prevention of disease, and 
thus far has had little place in medical museums, being taken up as a 
specialty in the half dozen museums of hygiene which now exist." 

William Hunter formed the great Glasgow collection between the 
years 1770 and 1800, and John Hunter, in 1787, opened the famous 
Hunterian Museum in London, bought by the English Government soon 
after (1799), and now known as the Museum of the Koyal College of 
Surgeons. 

Paris is proud of the two collections at the School of Medicine, the 
Musee Orfila and the Musee Dupuytren, devoted, the one to normal, 
the other to pathological anatomy. 

Ethnographic museums are especially numerous and fine in the north- 
ern part of continental Europe. They were proposed more than half a 
century ago by the French geographer Jomard, and the idea was first 
carried into effect about 1840 in the establishment of the Danish Ethno- 
graphical Museum, which long remained the best in Europe. Within 
the past twenty years there has been an extraordinary activity in this 
direction. 

In Germany, besides the museums in Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzic, 
considerable collections have been founded in Hamburg and Munich. 
Austria has in Vienna two for ethnography, the Court Museum (Hof- 
Museum) and the Oriental (Orientalisches) Museum. Holland has 
reorganized the National Ethnographical Museum (Rijks Ethnograph- 
isch Museum) in Leydeu, and there are smaller collections in Amster- 
dam, Rotterdam, and The Hague. France has founded the Trocadero 
(Musee de Trocadero). In Italy there is the important Prehistoric 
and Ethnographic Museum (Museo prehistorico ed etnografico) in 
Rome, as well as the collection of the Propagando, and there are 
museums in Florence and Venice. 

Ethnographical museums have also been founded in Christiania and 
Stockholm, the latter of which will include the rich material collection 
by Dr. Stolpe on the voyage of the frigate Yanadis around the world. 
In England there is less attention to the subject — the Christy collec- 
tion in the British Museum being the only one specially devoted to 
ethnography, unless we include also the local Blackmore Museum at 
Salisbury. 

In the United States the principal establishments arranged on the 
ethnographic plan are the Peabody Museum of Archaeology in Cam- 
bridge, and the collections in the Peabody Academy of Sciences at 
Salem, and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. 



I 111'. MUSEUMS OF THE FUTURE. 443 

The ethnological collections in Washington are classified on a double 
system, in one of its features corresponding to that of the European, 
in the other, like the famous Pitt Rivers collection at Oxford, arranged 
to show the evolution of culture and civilization without regard to race. 
This broader plan admits much material excluded by the advocates of 
ethnographic museums, who devote their attention almost exclusively 
to the primitive or non-European peoples. 

In close relation to the ethnographic museums are those which are 
devoted to some special field of human thought and interest. Most 
remarkable among these perhaps is the Musee Guimet, recently re- 
moved from Lyons to Paris, which is intended to illustrate the history 
of religions ceremonial among all races of men. Other good examples 
of this class are some of those in Paris, such as the Musee de Marine, 
which shows not only the development of the merchant and naval ma- 
rines of the country, but also, by trophies and other historical souvenirs, 
the history of the naval battles of the nation. The Musee d'Artillerie 
does for war, but less thoroughly, what the Marine Museum does in 
its own department, and there are similar museums in other coun- 
tries. Of musical museums perhaps the most important is the Musee 
Instrumental founded by Clapisson, attached to the Conservatory of 
Music in Paris. There is a magnificent collection of musical instruments 
at South Kensington, but its contents are selected in reference to their 
suggestiveness in decorative art. There are also large collections in the 
National Museum in Washington and the Conservatory of Music in Bos- 
ton, and the Metropolitan Museum in New York has recently been given 
a very full collection by Mrs. .John Crosby Brown, of that city. 

There is a Theatrical Museum at the Academie Francais in Paris, a 
Museum of Journalism at Antwerp, a Museum of Pedagogy in Paris, 
which has its counterpart in South Kensington. These are profes- 
sional, rather than scientific or educational, as are perhaps also the Mu- 
seum of Practical Fish Culture at South Kensington and the Museums 
of Hygiene in London and Washington. 

Archaeological collections are of two classes, those of prehistoric and 
historic archaeology. The former are usually absorbed by the ethno- 
graphic musenms, the latter by the art museums. The value to the 
historian of archaeological collections, both historic and prehistoric, has 
long been understood. The museums of London, Paris, Berlin, and 
Borne need no comment. In Cambridge, New York, and Washington 
are immense collections of the remains of man in America in the pre- 
Columbian period, collections which are yearly growing in significance, 
as they are made the subject of investigation, and there is an immense 
amount of material of this kind in the hands of institutions and private 
collectors in all parts of the United States. 

The museum at Naples shows, so far as a museum can, the history of 
Pompeii at one period. The museum of St. Germain, near Paris, ex- 
hibits the history of France in the time of the Cauls and of the IJoman 



444 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

occupation. In Switzerland, especially at Neuehatel, the history of the 
inhabitants of the Lake Dwellings is shown. The Assyrian and Egyp- 
tian galleries in the British Museums are museums of themselves. 

Historical museums are manifold in character, and of necessity local 
in interest. Some relate to the history of provinces or cities. One of 
the oldest and best of these is the Miirkisch Proviuzial Museum in Ber- 
lin ; another is the museum of the city of Paris, recently opened in the 
Hotel Canaveral. Many historical societies have collections of this 
character. Some historical museums relate to a dynasty, as the Mu- 
seum of the Hohenzollerns in Berlin. 

The cathedrals of southern Europe, and St. Paul's, in London, are in 
some degrees national or civic museums. The Galileo Museum in Flor- 
ence, the Shakespeare Museum at Stratford, are good examples of the 
museums devoted to the memory of representative men, and the Mon 
astery of St. Mark, in Florence, does as much as could be expected of 
any museum for the life of Savonarola. The Sloane Museum in Loudon, 
the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen, are similar in purpose and 
result, but they are rather biographical than historical. There are also 
others which illustrate the history of a race, as the Bavarian National 
Museum in Nuremberg. 

The Museums of Fine Art are the most costly and precious of ail- 
since they contain the master-pieces of the world's greatest painters and 
sculptors. In Rome, Florence, Venice, Naples, Bologna, Parma, Milan, 
Nurin, Modena, Padua, Ferrara, Brescia, Sienna and Pisa; in Munich, 
Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, and Prague ; in Paris, and many provincial 
cities of France; in London, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Copenhagen, 
Brussels, Antwerp, and the Hague, are great collections, whose names 
are familiar to us all, each the depository of priceless treasures of art. 
Many of these are remarkable only for their pictures and statuary, 
and might with equal right be called picture galleries ; others abound in 
the minor products of artists, and are museums in the broader sense. 

Chief among them is the Louvre, in Paris, with its treasures worth a 
voyage many times around the world to see; the Vatican, in Rome, 
with its three halls of antique sculptures, its Etruscan, Egpytian, Pagan, 
and Christian museums, its By zantiue gallery and its collection of medals ; 
the Naples Museum (Musee di Studii) with its marvelous Pompeiian 
.series; the Uffizi Museum in Florence, overflowing with paintings and 
sculptures, ancient and modern, drawings, engraved gems, enamels, 
ivories, tapestries, medals, and works of decorative art of every de- 
scription. 

There are special collections on the boundary line between art and 
ethnology, the manner of best installation for which has scarcely yet 
been determined. The Louvre admits within its walls a museum of 
ship models (Mus£e de Marine). South Kensington includes musical in- 
struments, and many other objects equally appropriate in an ethnologi- 
cal collection. Other art museums take up arms and armor, selected 
costumes, shoes, and articles of household use. Such objects, like por- 



THE MUSEUMS OF THE FUTURE. 445 

celaius, laces, medals, and metal work, appeal to the art museum ad- 
ministrator through their decorations and graceful forms. For thru 
uses he cares presumably nothing. As a consequence of this feeling, 
only articles of artistic excellence have been saved, and much has gone 
to destruction which would be of the utmost importance to those who 
arc now studying the history of human thought in the past. 

( )n the other hand, there is much in art museums which might to much 
better purpose be delivered to the ethnologist for use in his exhibition 
cases. There is also much which the art-museums, tied as it often is to 
traditionary methods of installation, might learn from the scientific 
museums. 

Many of the arrangements in the European art collections are calcu- 
lated to send cold shivers down the back of a sensitive visitor. The 
defects of these arrangements have been well described by a German 
critic, W. Burger. "Our museums," he writes, "are the veritable 
grave-yards of art iu which have been heaped up, with a tumulous-like 
proiniseuousness, the remains which have been carried thither. A 
Venus is placed side by side with a Madonna, a satyr next to a saint. 
Luther is iu close proximity to a Pope, a painting of a lady's chamber 
next to that of a church. Pieces executed for churches, palaces, city 
halls, for a particular edifice, to teach some moral or historic truth, de- 
signed for some especial light, for some well studied surrounding, all 
are hung pell-mell upon the walls of some noncommittal gallery — a kind 
of posthumous asylum, where a people, no longer capable of producing 
works of art, come to admire this magnificient gallery of debris." 

Wlieu a museum building has been provided, and the nucleus of a col- 
lection and an administrative staff are at hand, the work of museum- 
bnilding begins, and this work, it is to be hoped, will not soon reach an 
end. A finished museum is a dead museum, and a dead museum is a useless 
museum. One thing should be kept prominently in mind by any organ- 
ization which intends to found and maintain a museum, that the work will 
never be finished, thai when the. collections cease to grow, they begin to 
decay. A friend relating an experience iu South Kensington, said: " I 
applied to a man who sells photographs of such edifices for picturesof 
the main building. Be had none. 'What, no photographs of the South 
Kensington Museum!' I exclaimed; with some impatience. 'Why, 
sir,' replied the man, mildly, 'you see the museum doesn't stand still long 
enough to be photographed.' And so indeed it seems," continued Mr. 
Conway, "and this constant erection of new buildings and of new decora 
lions on those already erected, is the physiognomical expression of the 
new intellectual and aesthetic epoch which called the institution into ex- 
istence, and is through it gradually climbing to results which no man 
can foresee."' 

My prayer for the museums of the Tinted States and lor all othei 

similar agencies of enlightenment is this — that theymaj never cease to 
increase.

TE I'lTi) TE 1IENI'\. OB EASTEE ISLAM). 



By Paymaster William J. Thomson, U. S. Navy. 



THE DISCOVERY OF EASTER ISLAND. 

The honor of the discovery of Easter Island is contested by several 
of the earlier voyagers in the Pacific. Spanish writers claim that the 
island was sighted by Mendana in 15GG, but the account is by no means 
authenticated, and the records preserved are not sufficiently accurate to 
determine the exact track sailed over by that ancient mariner. Captain 
Davis is credited by Capt. William Dampier with being the first to sighi 
the island, and Lionel Wafer, who cruised with that bold navigator, 
on board of the Batchelor's Delight, gives the following account of the 
discovery in the year 1687: 

Bound in the southward, in latitude 12 degrees 30 minutes aud about L50 leagues 
off the coast, experienced a shock of earthquake, that was afterwards found to cor- 
respond with the destruction of Callao by earthquake. Having recovered from our 
fright we kept on to the southward. We steered south-and-by-east-half-easterly, 
until we came to latitude 27 degrees 20 minutes south, when about t wo hours before 
day we fell in with a small low, sandy island and heard a great roaring noise, like that 
of the sea beating upon the shore, right ahead of the ship. Whereupon the sailors, 
fearing to fall foul upon the shore before day, desired the captain to put the ship 
about, and to stand off until the day appeared ; to which the captain gave his consent. 
So we plied off till day and then stood in again with the land, which proved to be a 
small flat island, without any guard of rocks. We stood in within a quarter of a 
mile of the shore and could see it plainly, for it was a clear morning, not foggy or 
hazy. To the -vest ward about 12 leagues, by judgment, we saw a range of high land, 
which we took to be islands, for there were several partitions in the prospect. 

This land seemed to reach about 14 or 16 leagues in a range, and there came great 
flocks of fowls. I and many more of our men would have made this land and have 
gone ashore on it, but the captain would not permit us. The small island bears from 
Copiapd almost due easl 500 leagues, and from the Galapagos, under the line, 600 
leagues. 

Unfortunately, none of the voyagers on board of the Batchelor's De- 
light were permitted to land upon this unknown island, nor is mention 
made in the narratives of monoliths or unusual structures that might 
have been observed from the short distance in which it is claimed they 
approached the shore. The apparent inaccuracy in the description of 
the appearance of the land may have been due to the peculiar bearing 
of the vessel, but it gives foundation to the claim of Admiral Rogge- 

447 



448 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

veen, that Davis's island was not identical with the one discovered by 
him on April 7, J 722, and named Easter Island in commemoration of the 
day upon which the land was sighted. Roggeveen says: 

When w.e approached neai'er the land we saw distinctly from a short distance that 
the description of the sandy and low island did not accord in the least with our dis- 
covery. Furthermore, it could not be the same laud which the aforesaid voyagers 
claim to have seen stretching 14 to 16 leagues in front of them, and near the highland 
which Dampier j udged to be the coast-line of the unknown south. That Easter Island 
can not be the sandy island described by Davis is clear, because that was small and 
low, while on the contrary Easter Island is high and towers above the sea, having 
also two elevations rising above the level part. It would not be possible to mistake, 
even at the dry season of the year, the grass and verdure that covers the hill-sides 
for barren sand. After the Dutch custom of the day, the admiral assembled the com- 
manders of the three vessels composing his fleet — the Arend, the African Galley, and 
the Thienhoven — in council to pass formal resolutions claiming the discovery of the 
land. The proceedings of the assembly state that on Easter day land was sighted 
about 9 miles distant, of moderate height, and containing an area of about 6 Dutch 
miles. The weather being calm the vessels were not able to secure an anchorage 
near the laud until the next day. The island was found to be destitute of trees, but 
with a fertile soil producing bananas, potatoes, and sugar-cane of extraordinary 
thickness. It was unanimously agreed that both from the difference in the location 
as well as the appearance of the land seen by Davis, the fact was established beyond 
doubt that the island just discovered could not be the same. These proceedings, be- 
ing drawn up, were formally signed by Jacob Roggeveen, Jan Koster, Cornelius Bon- 
man, and Roelof Rosendaal. After sailing from Easter Tsland the vessels spent a 
number of days in a search for the low sandy island described by Davis, but not with 
success. 

The unreliable Behrens mentions in the " Two Years' Voyage " the 
discovery of Easter Island by Eoggeveen on the day celebrated as the 
resurrection of the Lord (April 6, 1722), in latitude 27 degrees south 
and longitude 268 degrees west. 

Capt. F. W. Beechey, R. N., commanding H. M. S. Blossom (Novem- 
ber, 1825), referring to the discovery of Easter Island, finds the credit 
due to Davis, giving the following reasons for the conclusions drawn : 

Had such an island been in existence answering to the description of that seen by 
Davis, geographers would not have been long in reconciling their opinions on the 
subject of his discovery, as in all probability they would have waived their objec- 
tions to its distance from Copiap6 in consideration of its identity. The subject of the 
.supposed discovery has been often discussed; aud when the data are so unsatisfactory 
as to allow one party to choose the islands of Felix and Ambrose for the land in ques- 
tion, and the other Easter Island, two places nearly 1,600 miles apart, they are not 
likely to be speedily reconciled unless two islands exactly answering the description 
given by Davis, and situated in the proper latitude, shall be found. 

Without entering upon a question which presents so many difficulties, I shall 
merely observe that, considering the rapid current that exists in the vicinity of the 
Galapagos, and extends, though with diminished force, throughout the trade-wind, 
the error in Davis's reckoning is not more than might have happened to any dull sail- 
ing vessel circumstanced as he was. In a short run from Juan Fernandez to Easter 
Tsland, Behrens, who was with Roggeveen, was drifted 318 geographical miles to the 
westward of his supposed situation. II. M. S. Blossom in passing over the same ground 
experienced a set of 270 miles in the short space of 18 days. M. La Perouse on his ar- 
rival at Sandwich Islands from Concepcion, touching at Easter Island on his way, 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 449 

found a similar error of 300 miles in the course of that passage. It is fair to presume 
that Davis was Longer in crossing from the Galapagos to Easter Island than either of 
those vessels or, ;it least, than the Blossom ; and it is consequently but reasonable to 
allow him a greater error, particularly as the fust pari of his route was through a 
much stronger current. But taking the error in the Blossom's reckoning as a fair 
amount, and applying it to the distance given by Wafer, there will remain only 204 
miles unaccounted for between it and the real position of Easter Island, which, from 
the foregoing considerations, added to the manner in which reckonings were formerly 
kept, does not appear to me to exceed the Hunt that might reasonably be ascribed to 
those causes. 

M. La Perouse was of the opinion that the islands of Felix and Ambrose were those 
under discussion, ami in order to reconcile their distance from CapiapO with that given 
by Wafer, has imputed to him a mistake, of a figure in his text, without considering 
that it would have been next to impossible for Davis to have pursued a direct course 
from the Galapagos to those islands (especially at the season in which his voyage 
was made), but on the contrary that he would be compelled to make a circuit which 
would have brought him much nearer to Easter Island, and that Davis acquainted 
Dampier with the situation of his discovery, which agreed with that contained iu 
Wafer's account. 

The alteration of a figure, it must be admitted, is rather arbitrary, as it has noth- 
ing to support it but the circumstance of the number of islands being the same. A 
mistake certainly might have occurred, hut in the admission of it either party may 
claim it as an advantage by interpreting the presumed error iu a way which would 
support his own opinion. 

Cook and Perouse differ in a very trilling degree from each other, and also from us, 
in the geographical position of Easter Island. The longitude is, by Cook, 101) degrees 
40 minutes 20 seconds, and deducting 18 minutes 30 seconds, in consequence of cer- 
tain corrections made at Fetegu Island, leaves 109 degrees, "27 minutes, 50 seconds 
west. That by Perouse, allowing the longitude of Coucepcion to be 72 degrees 50 
minutes 30 seconds west, is 109 degrees 32 minutes 10 seconds west, and our own is 
109 degrees 24 minutes 54 seconds west. 

Admitting that the land was first sighted by Davis, the fact is be. 
yond question that the Dutchmen under Koggeveen were the first 
Europeans to land on the island. From the unfortunate termination of 
bis cruise, and the suppression of his official journal for so many years, 
but little has been handed down to us in the way of description of the 
island as it then appeared. 

The Spaniards sighted the island in 1770, and gave it the name of 
St. Carlos. Captain Cook called it Easter Island in March, 1774, and 
sent an expedition on shore, but his log affords little in regard to its 
general appearance beyond the fact that it was parched and desolate, 
and of no value as a place of refresh men t. 

M. Bernizet, geographical engineer, who visited the island in April, 
1786, with the La Perouse expedition, describes its appearance with 
care, and after the lapse of a century his notes are found to be suffi- 
ciently accurate for ordinary purposes. 

Amasa Delano, Kotzebue, Lisiausky, and many other voyagers made 
brief calls at the island, and their journals afford little information. 
The recent French, Spanish, and English charts are sufficiently accurate 
in the main features, but some of the coast lines were evidently estab- 
lished from running surveys, ami are incorrect. During the stay of the 
U. Mis, 224, pt. ': 29 



450 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Mohican Lieut. F. M. Symonds, with Naval Cadet C. M. McCormick as 

assistant, made a careful survey of tbe island, and their chart, here- 
with appended, will be found accurate and replete with interest. (Plate 
XII.) 

SAILING DIRECTIONS. 

Vessels anchoring on this unprotected coast must be guided entirely 
by the direction of the wind at the time. The Mohican anchored in the 
roadstead of Hanga Boa (Cook's Bay on the English charts) on the 
morning of December 19, 18S6, and afterwards moved to a position off 
Auakena Bay (La Perouse Bay), for convenience in shipping the stone 
image, now in the National Museum. 

On the south coast there are good anchorages during northerly and 
westerly winds, but there is usually a heavy swell from the southwest, 
making the boat-landings at Vaihu both difficult and dangerous. With 
easterly winds a good anchorage will be found just outside of Hanga 
Pico Bay, with sandy bottom, in about 20 fathoms of water, and the 
boat-landing will be found safe. The best boat-landing on the island 
is at Anakena Bay; the beach is comparatively free from stones, and 
even with northerly winds the lauding would be no more difficult than 
is usual at Funchal. 

The rise and fall of the tide at Easter Island is about 2 feet. The 
northerly and westerly winds do not produce a high sea, but generally 
bring rain, and are usually confined to the winter season. These winds 
are known to the natives as "papakiuo" (ill-force). The northeast wind 
is called "tougariki;" it is variable, and frequent in summer. The 
southeast wind, known as "anoraro" (wide expanse), is the prevailing 
wind in summer. The south wind, called u motu-rauri" (dark leaf rock), 
blows in winter. The southwest wind blows strong in winter, and 
brings rain and a high sea. Vaitara (cut-water) is a winter wind from 
the west. The prevailing winds are from an easterly direction, and all 
others are of short duration. Light airs that frequently shift direction 
are usually accompanied by rain, and are called by the natives " tepu- 
hauga" (blows drift on shore), the reason for which is obvious. 

GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. 

The geological features of the island are replete with interest. The 
formation is purely of a volcanic character and embraces every variety 
pertaining to that struct ire. Basaltic, cellular, and tufaceous lavas 
abound in diversified forms. The basaltic is generally porous and scori- 
forin, but on the slope of the hills the substrata are frequently as coin- 
pact and dense as that of the coast-line. Near Anakena may be seen 
hills composed of scoria quite as cellular as pumice, and in close prox- 
imity compact beds having a dark blue basis, composed of crystals of 
glassy feldspar and olivine.

lar to volcanic cinder, having the lightness and qualities of coke. In 
some of the varieties the cavities are tilled with olivine crystals partly 
decomposed, but generally the cavities are empty. This lava when 
mixed with feldspar is sometimes of gray color; not unfrequeutly sev- 
eral tints of red may be seen, though the most common is a dark, luster- 
less brown. 

The liliaceous lavas are extremely interesting, because they form the 
most prominent feature in the physiognomy of the island. To this 
geological structure, with the incessant action of the trade-winds and 
heavy rains, is due the fact that the island is surrounded by precipitous 
cliffs, rising in some cases to a thousand feet in height. The forma- 
tion is extremely friable, and by the action of the elements, enormous 
masses are continually disappearing beneath the waves of the sea that 
beat upon this unprotected shore. These tufas differ considerably in 
consistency at the eastern end of the island. The species is a tine light- 
red dust that is blown about by the wind and is destitute of vegetation; 
towards the southwest end the basis is a compact mud-like red clay, 
while the colossal crowns, intended to adorn the gigantic statues, are 
carved out of a variety that has been scorified in one of the craters, 
and is of a dull reddish color. 

The ordinary rules for estimating the age of rocks by compactness 
can be applied at Easter Island only hypothetic-ally, because the seori- 
form and more dense specimens are found immediately contiguous to 
one another. In places they are quite conglomerated, as though older 
formations had been disturbed by volcanic convulsions, while a new 
flow of lava enveloped and sealed the whole into a heterogeneous mass. 
During our short stay on the islands there was no opportunity to 
measure the lava How or to make investigations of that nature. 

Natural caves are numerous, both on the coast-line and in the interior 
of the island. Some of them are of undoubted antiquity and bear evi- 
dence of having been used by the early inhabitants as dwellings and 
as burial places. It is reported that small images, inscribed tablets, and 
other objects of iuterest have been hidden away in such caves and 
Anally lost through land-slides. 

The numerous hills on this island have gently sloping sides, except 
where they approach the coast, falling at this point precipitously to the 
sea. The plains are irregularly shaped, and some of the smaller ones 
rise to a considerable height. The physical character of the soil is 
alluvial. The substratum is volcanic ash and stones, and the upper 
formation is composed of decayed vegetable matter mingled with a rich 
deposit of decomposed lava washed down from hills by the frequent 
rains. These plains being formed by the periodical eruptions of the 
volcanoes, some difference may be noted in the quantity of the soil, 
varying according to location. 

After the successive discharges of lava from the craters of Kana Ko- 

raliti aud Itaua-kao had prescribed the limits of the island and wheu 



452 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

this flow had ceased, there was a heavy deposit of mud, covering deeply 
both bill and dale. This condensed earth, after the lapse of centuries, 
has formed a soil tbat produces a natural grass affording an excellent 
pasturage for flocks and herds. The expiring energy of the volcanic 
power appears to have been directed, long after the formation of this 
soil, to sprinkling thickly the entire surface of the island with stones 
and small bowlders, thus providing the means of attraction and hold- 
ing the moisture, nature's substitute, as it were, for trees. The natives 
have distinct names for the following varieties: Black and red tufa 
with volcauic cinder and pumice are called " Maea-Hane-haue," " maea" 
being the generic term applied to all stone. A soft gray tufa is ground 
down with the juice of the sugar-cane and used as a paint. This is 
known as " Kiri-kiri Teu." Hard slates, black, red, and gray, are used 
for stone axes and called " Maea-Toke." Granite used for the same 
purpose is known as "Maea Nevhive. The hardest and finest stone im- 
plements are made of the flinty beach pebble known as "Maea-Reug- 
rengo." The hard cellular stones from which the majority of the 
platforms are built are called " Maea-Pupura." The material from which 
images were constructed is called " Maea-Matariki," aud the obsidian 
from which spear-heads were made is known as " Maea-Mataa." 

VARIOUS NAMES OF THE ISLAND. 

Previous to the general recognition of the name bestowed by Admi- 
ral Roggeveen in commemoration of the day upon which the land was 
discovered, it had not been regularly christened by either of the earlier 
navigators who claimed to have sighted it. The Spaniards afterwards 
gave it the name of San Carlos, but the Dutchman's title of Easter Is- 
land was preferred by the chart-makers and was adopted by the world 
in general. 

The island is known to the natives as "Te Pito te Henua," the lit- 
eral interpretation of the words signifying the " navel and uterus." This 
singular name was given to the land, according to the ancient tradi- 
tions, by Hotu Metua immediately after its discovery, and has been 
handed down through succeeding generations unchanged. To the 
simple minded Polynesian this name is suggestive, appropriate, and 
beautiful. The child of nature recognizing the volcanic origin of the 
island can see in the great volcano, Rana Roraka, a resemblance to the 
human "te pito" in relation to its shape and gently sloping sides sur- 
rounding the shallow crater. The same association of ideas would 
picture the majestic volcano, Rana Kao, at the southwest end, as " te 
henua," in whose womb was conceived the embryo and whose vitals 
brought forth the rocks and earth from which the island was formed. 
"Kiti te eirauga" is stated by an English writer of some note to be 
the native name for the island, but we could not find any authority for 
it, nor did the natives with whom we came in contact recognize tbe 
name. 



TE PITO TE HENITA, OR EASTKR ISLAM). 453 

Throughout southeastern Polynesia this island is known as Rapa 
Nui, but the name is of accidental origin and only traces back about 
twenty years. When the islanders, kidnaped by the Peruvians, were 
being returned to their homes, there was for a time a question as to the 
identity of those from Easter Island. The native name of "TePito te 
Henna" was not recognized by the French officials, and finding certain 
fellow-sufferers hailing from Oparo, an island lying '2,000 miles to the 
westward, were more successful under the local appellation of Rapa iti 
Little Rapa), the euphonious title Mas dropped and Rapa nui (Great) 
Rapa) substituted. Teapy, Waihn, and various other names have been 
given to the island, but clearly without warrant. Vaihu was the name 
of a district and was occupied by the most powerful clan in the days 
of Cook and La Perouse, but it was never applied to the entire island. 

CLTMATE. 

The climate is not unlike that of Madeira, with one wet and one dry 
season. From April to October the rainfall is copious, and in summer 
it is limited to passing showers. The mean temperature at the time'of 
our visit (midsummer), in the shade, at 13 o'clock p. m., was between 78° 
and 80° Fan., and at 2 o'clock a. m. there was a fall of about G degrees. 
The southeast trades blow fresh at the beginning and end of the sea- 
son, and make the climate salubrious and healthful. Our long fatiguing 
marches, while making the exploration of the island, were not accom- 
panied with inconvenience from exposure to the direct rays of the sun, 
the constant breezes making the sensible temperature always appear 
lower than that recorded by the thermometer. Violent exercise induced 
profuse perspiration, but evaporation was always free and rapid. Elec- 
tric storms are unknown. 

VILLAGES AND HABITATIONS. 

The Catholic missionaries built at Vaihu, on the south coast, near 
Cape Koe Koe, a commodious and substantial church, a parsonage con- 
taining three rooms, and several outbuildings. The house is now the 
residence of Mr. Salmon, the outbuildings are occupied by his employ 6s, 
and the church lias degenerated into a storehouse for wool. The prin- 
cipal native settlement is at Mataveri, on the southwest coast, and about 
a mile distant, at Hanga Roa, a small neat church has been erected. 
Here the islanders assemble on .Sundays and other occasions to hear 
the service read by one of their number, who was ordained especially 
to take charge of this congregation upon the departure of the French 
missionaries. At the southwest cud of the island, and near the base of 
liana Kas, is the residence of Mr. Brander. 

The house is of modern structure, with huge and convenient rooms, 
but is in a state of bad repair, and is more, attractive' when viewed 
from a distance, surrounded by the shrubbery and vines that have been 
planted about it, than it is upon close inspection.

The native priest and a few of his connections reside at Hanga Koa,

been abandoned for more comfortable dwellings constructed under the 
direction of a Danish carpenter out of material obtained from the wreck- 
age of several vessels loaded with Oregon lumber. These buildings are 
of a style of architecture commonly met with in small cheap barns and 
stables, but to the simple-minded islanders they supply all the comforts 
that could be desired. 

These houses are usually about 25 feet long and 15 feet wide with 
undressed weather-boards and roofed with the same material. Hinged 
doors open in the center and admit light and ventilation, though a few 
of the more pretentions buildings are furnished with small glazed win- 
dows. The floors are of bare earth strewn with a litter of dried grass, 
filthy and vermin-infested from long use. Mats made of bulrushes aie 
spread out for sleeping ; .several rough bedsteads and chests were seen, 
but the majority of the houses are destitute of furniture or ornament. 
Several families occupy the same dwelling; men, women, and children 
lie down together like dogs in a kennel, and with about the same ideas 
of what constitutes the comforts of life. 

FLORA. 

The native traditions agree in the statement that the discoverers of the 
island found it destitute of trees and all vegetation except grasses and 
a creeping vine bearing a dehiscent fruit to which the name Moki-oo-ne 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OK EASTER ISLAND. 455 

was given. Hotu-Matua and his followers are believed tobave brought 
with them potatoes, yams, bananas, sugarcane, and the seed of various 
plants, including the paper-mulberry and toromirp trees. The newly 
discovered species of legume, together with tish and turtle, enabled the 
first settlers to exist while the first crop was being planted and culti- 
vated. 

Nothing could be more contradictory than the. description which the 
different voyagers have given of Easter Island. Roggeveeu states that 
it was destitute of trees, but the land was found to be exceptionally fer- 
tile, producing bananas, potatoes, and sugar-cane of extraordinary thick- 
ness, and concludes by saying that the island, by virtue of its productive 
soil and salubrious climate, could be made an earthly paradise by careful 
cultivation. Behrens speaks of trees on the island, but to his romantic 
eyes the clusters of- banana and paper- mulberries were magnified into 
forests. Captain Cook expresses great disappointment in the expecta- 
tion that he had formed of this island as a place of refreshment. The 
only articles of importance obtained were potatoes and yams, and these 
were only sufficient to serve for a few meals; while the fowls, bananas, 
and sugar-cane were in such inconsiderable quantities that they were 
deemed hardly worth mentioning. George Foster writes: 

The island is so very barren that the whole number of plants growing upon il docs 
not exceed twenty species, of which the, far greater part is cultivated, though the 
space which the platforms occupy is inconsiderable compared with what lies waste. 
The soil is altogether stony and parched by the sun, and the water is so scarce that, 
the inhabitants drink it out of wells which have a strong admixture of brine, and 
some of our people really saw them drink id' the sea water when they were thirsty. 

Mr. Foster devoted considerable attention to the investigation of 
indigenous plants, ami his report embraces all of the most important 
varieties. He found the paper-mulberry carefully cultivated for the 
purpose of making cloth. The steins were from 2 to 1 feet high, and 
tiny were planted in rows among the rocks where the rains had 
washed a little soil together. The Thcnpesid populnea Carr. (Hibiscus 
l><>l)iihi< its Linn.), was cultivated in the same manner, and likewise 
a Mimosa, which is referred to as the only shrub that affords the 
natives sticks for their clubs and pattoo-pattoos, and wood sufficient 
to patch up a canoe. Wild celery and a few other small plants were 
identified as the same species as that which he had found growing in 
abundance on the shores of New Zealand. lie also discovered a variety 
of night-shade, which the Tahiti aus use as a vulnerary remedy (Solantim 
nigrum), and speculates as to whether it was used here for the same pur- 
pose. 

La Perouse, impressed with a desire to relieve to some extent the 
destitute condition in which he found the islanders and of contributing 
essentially and lastingly to their welfare, had ground prepared in which 
he sowed, various kinds of pulse. Peaches, plums, and cherries were 
planted, also pips of oranges inn! lemons. The natives were instructed 



456 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

as fully as possible in tlie care aud attention tbe new plants would re- 
quire, and made to understand the value of this addition to their re- 
sources. Not a trace can be found of the things planted by this gener- 
ous Frenchman, but whether they were suffered to die out through the 
ignorance or indolence of the natives may never be known. 

We found the lapse of a century had made but little improvement in 
the resources of the islanders. Trees have been planted around the 
house of Mr. Brander, at the southwest end of the island, but, with 
the exception of the fig, acacia, and paper-mulberry, they do not appear 
to thrive. At various places throughout .this land we found small 
clumps of Edwardsia, Broussonetia, and Hibiscus, but all were dead, 
having been stripped of their bark by the flocks of sheep, which roam 
at will over the island. None of these trees were over 10 feet high, 
and the largest trunk we found would measure about 5 inches in 
diameter. 

The natives are not altogether ignorant of husbandry, though they 
practice it spasmodically and at a great expense of time and labor, dif- 
fering in no respect from the customs of their forefathers hundreds of 
years ago. In the cultivation of yams, potatoes, and taro, the young 
plants are protected from the fierce heat of the sun by a mulching of 
dried grass gathered from the uncultivated ground. Bananas are 
grown in holes a foot or more deep and with sloping sides, designed to 
eatch and hold the rain-water as long as possible about the roots of the 
plant. Sugarcane is grown in protected spots, and attains the height 
of about 10 feet. During our peregrinations this succulent plant was 
extensively used in lieu of something to drink, and proved exceedingly 
valuable in preventing a parched condition of the throat. The natives 
have no knowledge of the art of extracting the juice of the cane for 
the purpose of making sugar. 

The sweet potatoes are large and remarkably good. The natives eat 
them both raw and cooked. Experiments have been made recently 
with imported white potatoes, but they have been tried in various situ- 
ations and at different seasons without success. After the first growth 
they appear like new potatoes, and when planted again they are inva- 
riably soft and sweet, and are much less palatable than the indigenous 
variety. We saw tobacco plants growing in secluded spots, but were 
unable to determine by whom or when they were introduced. The 
natives maintain that the seed was included among that which was 
brought to the island by the first settlers. Tomato plants were also 
found growing wild, aud on several occasions proved a valuable addi- 
tion to our limited fare. 

A wild gourd is common, aud constituted the only water-jar and 
domestic utensil known to the natives. Suitable clay abounds, but the 
potter's art seems never to have been known on the island. There are 
two varieties of indigenous hemp. 

We saw no flowering plants that are indigenous to the soil. Vervain, 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 457 

Verbena officinalis, and a few others grow in great profusion, but they 
grew from cuttings obtained from a French vessel of war. 

Ferns of many varieties are common, and grow in profusion in the 
craters of the volcanoes. Except in a few exposed places, the slopes 
of the hills aud the valleys are covered with a perennial grass. It 
strongly resembles the Jamaica grass (Paspalum) and grows in bunches 
or tufts, which in the dry season become so slippery as to make the 
walking both difficult and dangerous. This natural growth supplies 
ample pasturage for the numerous cattle and sheep owned by Messrs. 
Salmon and Brander. 

To avoid the depredations of the sheep that wander over the island 
without restraint, the natives are compelled to protect their cultivated 
patches by stone walls. The volcanic stones furnish the only available 
material for these barriers, and are thrown loosely together to a height 
of 5 or 6 feet, and inclose gardens from a few feet square to several 
acres. The deeply rooted prejudice existing in the native mind against 
physical exertion that might be avoided, has developed a happy ex- 
pedient to save labor and at the same time to escape the ravages of the 
animals lately imported by the foreign residents. Ruins of houses, 
cairns, platforms, and tombs are thickly scattered over the island; 
many of the standing walls are sufficiently well preserved and others 
require but little repair. Within these ancient foundation walls are 
raised their limited crops of fruit and vegetables; the only disadvan- 
tage being the contracted area available for each plot. 

MAMMALS. 

There are no quadrupeds peculiar to the island except several vari- 
eties of rodents. The ancient traditions claim that a goat like animal 
was found here by the first colonists, with wide-spreading horns and 
giving six young at a birth. It is difficult to imagine the foundation 
for this fancy. We found no representation of such an animal either 
in the mural paintings or outlined on the sculptured rocks, and diligent 
search of the debris of the caves failed to disclose any of the bones or 
traces of mammals. 

La Perouse found the islanders without domestic animals, and left 
with them two ewes, a she-goat, and a sow, with the male of each spe- 
cies. Their native names indicate the recent addition to the language. 

In the caves and among the ruins we saw many rats of great size. 
The examination of the tombs disclosed the fact that the bones had 
been frequently gnawed by these rodents, and their nests were some- 
times found inside the crania. 

There, are on the island a few cats as wild as though they had never 
seen the face of man, though they are descended from feline pets landed 
by some passing vessel. They have grown to an immense size, and 
upon several occasions wlien encountered in the dark recesses of a cave 



458 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

or tomb presented a formidable appearance. Messrs. Salmon & Bran- 
der bave a herd of GOO cattle, and a flock of sheep numbering 18,000. 
The cattle are from Chilian stock, are small, averaging only about 400 
pounds, and possess no dairy qualities ; the cows giving barely enough 
milk to rear their calves. The sheep were also imported from Chili. 
The wool is coarse and scant, the average being only about 2 pounds 
per animal. The export of last year in wool was 16 tons, and was shiped 
to Europe via Tahiti. An effort will be made next year to improve the 
breed of sheep by introducing blooded rams from Australia. A few 
tough little horses have been introduced from the island breed of Tahiti, 
but it is doubtful whether this will ever become an important industry. 

BIRDS. 

Small birds are altogether absent and, except the ordinary domestic 
fowl, we found only the tropic or man-of-war bird, petrels, gulls, and a 
variety of aquatic birds. George Foster observed noddies so tame as 
to settle on the shoulders of the natives, but he did not conclude that 
they kept a regular breed of them. The common domestic fowl was 
found on the island by the early navigators, and it is claimed that they 
were brought there by the first colonists. They are of the same kind 
as the common chickens reared at home; their bodies are small, and 
the legs long, but this is no doubt the result of long inbreeding. The 
natives all have tame fowls about their dwellings, but there are others 
in a wild state. We shot some of the wildfowls and found them tough 
and inferior in taste to those that were domesticated. 

FISHES. 

Fish has always been the principal means of support for the islanders, 
and the natives are exceedingly expert in the various methods of capt- 
uring them. The bonito, albicore, ray, dolphin, and porpoise are the 
off- shore fish most highly esteemed, but the swordfish and shark are 
also eaten. Rock-fish are caught in abundance and are remarkably 
sweet and good. Small fish of many varieties are caught along the 
shore, and the flying-fish are common. Eels of immense size are caught 
in the cavities and crevices of the rock-bound coast. Fresh- water fish 
are reported to exist in the lakes inside of the craters, but we did not 
see any of them. 

Turtles are plentiful and are highly esteemed ; at certain seasons a 
watch for them is constantly maintained on the sand beach. The tur- 
tle occupies a prominent place in the traditions, and it is frequently re- 
presented in the hieroglyphics and also appears on the sculptured rocks. 
A species of crayfish classified by Dr. Philippi, of Chili, as "papar- 
ohalu," is abundant. These are caught by the natives by diving into 
the pools among the rocks, and form an important article of food. 

Shell-fish are plentiful. Remains of several varities of univalves 
were found in the stone houses at Orongo, and frequently met with in 
the debris of the caves throughout the island. 



TE PITO TE HENtTA, OB EASTER ISLAND. 459 

REPTILES AND [NSECTS. 

Small lizards are frequently seen among the rocks; the natives 
claim that a Large variety is not uncommon, but we saw nothing of it. 
No snakes exist, but there are centipedes whose bite is said to be ex- 
tremely painful, though not attended with serious consequences. Sev- 
eral varieties of butterflies were observed. Myriads of flies infest 
every part of the island. Vliegen Island was the name given to Riroa, 
in the Pamotu group, or Low Archipelago, by Schonten in 1(510, but 
we were tormented here by hundreds where we saw tens on the Attol. 
From the earliest dawn of day to the close of the short twilight, hordes 
of flies annoyed us; it math? no difference whether we skirted the cliffs 
to windward, climbed the breeze swept hills, or burrowed in the musty 
caves and tombs, swarms of Hies met ns, prepared to dispute every foot 
of the ground. Whatever may have been the parent stock of the Poly- 
nesians, we came to the unanimous conclusion that we had discoverd 
here the lineal descendants of the tiies that composed the Egyptian 
plague, and can testify that they have not degenerated in the lapse of 
time. 

Fleas occasioned us more annoyance than the flies, because this in- 
dustrious little insect was untiring in its attentions by day and night. 
They were found in numbers in all the camping places, and we seemed 
to get a fresh supply every time a halt was called. 

There are fifteen or twenty mangy dogs of a mongrel breed on the 
island whose hides were literally alive with jumping insects. They 
had long ago given up all hope of relief, and made no ineffectual efforts 
in that direction, but they plainly expressed in their mute way the 
conviction that life in this flea-bitten state was not worth the living. 

It was said that there were no mosquitoes on the island until cisterns 
were built by Messrs. Salmon and Brander to catch the rain-water. 
We saw none elsewhere. 

Cockroaches about l' inches long, with antenna 1 to correspond, infest 
every dwelling on the island, from the humble thatched hut to the com- 
paratively comfortable residences of the foreigners. They partook of 
our food at mealtimes with a freedom which showed that the presence of 
the stranger caused do restraint ; while at night they made themselves 
familiar with our garments in whatever time could be spared from 
their gastronomic researches. 

A peculiar variety of snapping beetle made its appearance every 
evening just before sundown, appearing suddenly aim vanishing with 
daylight. 

NETS AND ROPES. 

Various forms of fishing nets were manufactured, from the hand net 
to the long seine called " kupenga maito," which was supported by 
poles at the extremities, weighted with stone sinkers on the submerged 
edge and floated by billets of wood ou the surface (Plate Kill). Their 



460 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

light casting-nets were used with great dexterity as they waded along 

the beach, and when a shoal of small fish appeared, the net was thrown 

with the right hand. These nets were remarkably made, and in the 

manufacture a netting-needle of bone or wood was used, much after 

the fashion in more civilized countries. The coarse nets and cordage 

was made from the twisted bark of the hibiscus, and the fine ones from 

the fiber of the indigenous hemp. From the strong heavy ropes used 

in raising and transporting the colossal images to the light but durable 

fish-lines, the threads were all twisted by hand, across the knee, into 

even strands, which were multiplied according to the size and strength 

required. 

natives. 

The population of Easter Island is not stated in actual figures by 
any of the traditions or legends, but all agree in the statement that the 
different districts were peopled by numerous and powerful clans who 
were constantly at war with each other. The immense amount of work 
performed by the image-makers and platform builders would indicate 
the employment of a great many persons, if accomplished within a 
reasonable limit of time, or the extension over several centuries, if the 
undertaking was carried out by successive generations. The ruins of 
extensive settlements near Tahai Bay Kotatake plains, around Puka 
Mauga-Mauga mountain, the Rana-Hana-Kana coast, the vicinity of 
Anakeua, the shores of La Perouse Bay, and extending along the coast 
from Tongariki to Vinapu in an almost unbroken line, would prove 
either the presence of numerous inhabitants, or a frequent change of 
location. The limited area of the 32 square miles of surface available 
for cultivation precludes the idea of any very dense population, and 
many reasons might be assigned for a frequent change of habitation. 
We know that the stone houses at Orango were only occupied during the 
feast of "bird eggs." The image-builders engaged in the quarries of 
liana Roraka probably lived at Tongariki, and entire communities may 
have changed location at differeut seasons of the year from failure of 
water supply, or some equally sufficient reason. 

The early Spanish voyagers estimated the population at between 
2,000 aud 3,000. Admiral Boggeveeu states that he was surrounded 
by several thousand natives before he opened fire upon them. Captain 
Cook, fifty-two years later, placed the number at between 600 and 700, 
and Foster, who was with him, estimated them at 900. Twelve years 
later (1786) La Perouse placed the population at 2,000. Bushey (1825) 
puts the number at about 1,500. Kotzebue aud Lisiansky make more 
liberal estimates. Equally chimerical and irreconcilable deductions 
are made by recent writers. Mr. A. A. Salmon, after many years' resi- 
dence on the island, estimates the population between 1850 and 1860 
at nearly 20,000. Tue diminution of the actual number of inhabitants 
progressed rapidly from 1863, when the majority of the able bodied men 
were kidnaped by the Peruvians, and carried away to work in the 
guano deposits of the Chincha Islands, and plantations in Peru. Only

a few of these unfortunates were released, aud all but two of them died 
upon the return voyage, from small-pox. The disease was introduced 
on the shore and nearly decimated the island in a short time. An old 
man called Pakomeo is ;tt present the only survivor of those returned 

from slavery, and he is eloquent in the description of the barbarous 
treatment received from the hands of the Peruvians. In 1864 a Jesuit 
mission was established on the island, and through the teachings of 
Frere Eugene, the ancient customs and mode of life were replaced by 
habits of more civilized practice. 

H. M. S. Topaae visited the island in 1808. At that time the popula- 
tion was about 900, one-third of the number being females. In 1875 
about 300 persons were removed to Tahiti under contract to work in the 
sugar plantations of that island. In 1878 the mission station was 
abandoned, and about 300 people followed the missionaries to the Gam- 
bier Archipelago. 

Mr. Salmon took a complete census of the people just before the ar- 
rival of the Mohican, ami we were furnished with a list containing the 
names of every man, woman, and child on the island. The total number 
of natives is at present 155. Of these 08 are men, 43 women, 17 boys 
under fifteen years of age, and 27 girls of corresponding age. The popu- 
lation has been for several years at a standstill, the births and deaths 
being about equal in numbers. The longevity of the islanders appears 
to compare favorably with the natives of more favored lands. The 
oldest man among them is a chief called Mali; his actual age is not 
known, but he must be upwards of ninety, and his wife is. nearly of the

PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF THE NATIVES. 

In describing* the personal appearance of the islanders (Plate XIV) 
the early writers give us a pleasing variety to choose from. Behrens 
solemnly states that a boat came off to the ship steered by a single man, 
a giant 1U feet high, etc. He afterwards observes, " with truth, I might 
say that these savages are all of more than gigantic size. The men are 
tall and broad in proportion, averaging 12 feet in height. Surprising as 
it may appear, the tallest men on board of our ship could pass between 
the legs of these children of Goliath without bending the head. The 
women can not compare (Fig. 3) in stature with the men, as they are

commonly not above 10 feet high." Roggeveeii does not commit himself 
to a measurement, but states "the people are well proportioned of 
limb, having large and strong muscles, and are great in stature. They 
have snow-white teeth, which are uncommonly strong; indeed, even 
among the aged and gray we were surprised to see them crack large 
hard nuts whose shells were thicker than those of our peach seeds." La 
Perouse contradicts the account as to their enormous height and 
praises the beauty of the women, who, he says, resemble Europeans in 
color and features. M. Rollin states that the females were more liber- 
ally endowed, with grace and beauty than any which were afterwards

met with. The natives arc not of large stature; a few of the men are 
tall, but they arc of spare build, stand erect with straight carriage, and 
appear taller than they really arc. 

Great care was taken to measure accurately the human remains found 
in the oldest tombs excavated on the island. These proved the ancient 
islanders to have been of medium size, and the largest skeleton found 
measured a little short of G feet. The men arc strong-, active, and capa- 
ble of standing great fatigue — a fact demonstrated to our satisfaction 
during the exploration of the island. The women are shorter and of 
smaller bone than the men, as is usually the case throughout Polynesia. 

Mendana states that the islanders are nearly white and have red 
hair. They resemble the Marquesans more than any other Polynesians, 
and considerable variety prevails in their complexions. The children 
are not much darker than Europeans, but the skin assumes a brown 
hue as they grow up and are exposed to the sun and trade-winds. The 
parts of the body that are covered retain the light color, and the females, 
who are usually protected from the sun, are much fairer than the men. 
Bronze complexions are believed to indicate strength, and a dark skin 
is considered a mark of beauty. The eyes are dark brown, bright, and 
full, with black brows and lashes not very heavy. The countenance is 
usually open, modest, and pleasing. The facial angle is slightly reced- 
ing, the nose aquiline and well proportioned; the prominent chin with 
thin lips gives somewhat the appearance of resolution to the countenance. 

The native character and disposition has naturally improved as com- 
pared with the accounts given by the early navigators. They were 
then savages wearing no clothes, but with bodies painted inbrightcol- 
ors. The women are said to have been the most bold and licentious in 
Polynesia, if the reports are correctly stated, but we found them mod- 
est and retiring and of higher moral character than any of the islanders. 
The repulsive habit of piercing the lobe of the ear and distending the 
hole until it could contain bone or wooden ornaments of great size is no 
longer practiced, but there are still on the island persons with ear-1 jbes 
so long that they hang pendent upon the shoulders, in disposition the 
natives are cheerful and contented. Our guides were continually jok- 
ing with each other, and we saw no quarreling or fighting. They are 
said to be brave and fearless of danger, but revengeful and savage 
when aroused. They are fond of dress and ornaments. Very little tappa 
cloth is now worn, the people being pretty well equipped with more 
comfortable garments, obtained from the vessels that have called at the 
island. (Plate XV). Straw hats are neatly braided by the women and 
worn by both sexes. The women wear the hair in long plaits down the 
back, the men cut the hair short and never discolor it with lime as is the 
custom in many of the islands of Polynesia, The hair is coarse, black, 
and straight, sometimes wavy, but never in the kinky stage. The beard 
is thin and sparse. Gray hair is common among those beyond middle 
life and baldness is very rare, 



464 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Kara is not grown upon the island and the drink made from the 
kava-root, common throughout the South Sea, is not known to these 
people. The diminution of the inhabitants can not be ascribed to the 
introduction of intoxicating drinks, or indeed any of the factors usually 
advanced in such cases. The decadence was no doubt accelerated by 
the introduction of the small-pox, and by the deportation of large num- 
bers, but it is earnestly hoped that the small remnant of the people will 
increase and multiply under the comforts and protection acquired from 
contact with civilization. 

BRUTAL TREATMENT OF NATIVES BY EARLY VOYAGERS. 

The brutal treatment that the islanders received from the hands of 
their early visitors was not calculated to impress them favorably. 
Usually the strangers were met upon their arrival by a crowd of noisy, 
restless, impetuous people, as curious as children and as peaceable and 
friendly with all their boisterousness. The greatest fault they com- 
mitted was theft, and in return numbers were shot down and innocent 
persons murdered. Roggeveen plainly states that his boats approached 
the island well armed and in great fear of the natives. The men were 
formed in line of battle as they disembarked, and before all werelanded, 
some one in the rear fired a shot, and immediately a fusilade began by 
these cowardly ruffians upon the unfortunate islanders, ten or twelve of 
whom were killed outright and as many were wounded. The admiral 
quietly shifts the responsibility for this outrage upon the shoulders of the 
second mate of the Thienhovcn, who offers as an excuse that some of the 
natives were observed to take up stones and make threatening gest- 
ures. As soon as the astonishment and terror of the inhabitants had 
subsided, they sued for mercy, and everything they possessed in the 
way of fruits and vegetables, poultry, etc., was procured and laid as a 
peace offering at the feet of the Dutchman. Captain Cook afterwards 
received the most friendly reception possible from the same people, but 
he observed their great dread of fire-arms, the deadly effects of which 
were thorougly understood. The landing party conducted a brisk trade, 
and were highly amused to witness the small thefts committed upon 
one another in order to obtain articles for barter, yet Lieutenant Edge- 
comb did not hesitate to immediately shoot with his musket a poor 
unfortunate who picked up a little bag of botanical specimens. 

Captain Beechey was received with friendly demonstrations and his 
boats, sent on shore for supplies, obtained bananas, yams, potatoes, su- 
gar-cane, nets, etc., in trade, and some were thrown into the boats, leav- 
ing the strangers to make what return they chose. His journal dwells 
at great length upon the thieving propensity of the natives. His boats 
were surrounded by native swimmers, who made off with small articles 
that came within reach of them, and among them were women who 
were not the actual plunderers, but who procured the opportunity for 
others by engrossing the attention of the seameu, 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASIER ISLAND. 4H5 

To reach the landing-place the boats had to pass a small isolated rock 
upon which many persons had congregated, and who sang a song of wel- 
come, accompanied by gestures showing thai, the visit was acceptable. On 
shore the party was surrounded by a crowd clamorous to obtain some- 
thing from the strangers, the few presents ottered were accepted, and 
then everything that came handy appropriated in the most opeu man 
ner. This led to a scuffle, in which slicks and stones were freely used, 
resulting in a fight in which the native chief was shot and killed. The 
punishment of the natives, according to European ideas, was both cruel, 
and unnecessary. La Perouse judged the same crimes more leniently, 
and did not feel justified in committing murder to avenge petty thefts. 
The outrages perpetrated upon the defenseless people by Captain Rugg, 
of the Friend, and other freebooters, including the Peruvian slavers, 
require no comment. 

THIEVING. 

The natives did not attach any moral delinquency to the practice of 
thieving. They had a god of thieving, and successful operations were 
believed to be accomplished under his patronage, and only detected 
when not sanctioned by that spiiit. The detected thief was made to 
suffer for his crime by an established system of retaliation peculiar to 
themselves, but the individual never lost caste or the respect of his 
friends. Thieves caught in tne act might be bea' en, knocked about, 
and the aggressor was permitted to otter no resistance in the efforts to 
escape, although he might be the largest and most powerful. Before 
the retaliation could be enforced, the theft had to be proven and tixed 
beyond question, then the plundered individual was at liberty to recover 
the value of the loss from any property available belonging to the robber, 
and in the event of the value not being recovered, articles of value 
could be destroyed to equalize the amount. Retaliation for theft could 
be enforced by the weak and feeble against the strong and powerful, 
and any resistance would call to their aid the entire community. 

The rite of circumcision, so common throughout Polynesians unknown 
here, and their language contains no equivalent word for it. At the 
presenttime, all the natives have professed Christianity, and the ancient 
customs have been replaced by the ceremonies of the church to a great 
extent, but since the departure of the missionaries there has been a 
tendency to return to the old ideas, and many superstitions and practices 
are mingled with their religion. The marriage ceremony is performed 
by the acting priest in the church, but the practice is permitted with 
children who have not reached the age of puberty, and the betrothal is 
conducted by parents, the relations of the female paying a stipulated 
amount, generally in food to be consumed by the friends at the least 
given to celebrate the event. It is not certain that polygamy ever 
existed, but an ancient custom permitted the husband to sell or lease 
his wife to another for a stated term. On account of the disproportion 
in the number of the sexes, celibacy was a matter of necessity, and 
11. Mis. L'L'I, pt. l' 30

probably originated this custom. Love of family is a strong trait in 
their character; children are fondly cared for, and the desire for off- 
spring is general. 

TATTOOING. 

Tattooing is not practiced at the present time, none being observed 
upon children and young persons. But all those advanced in life are 
ornamented on all parts of the body. Unlike the Samoaus and other 
islanders, where a standard pattern is adhered to, the designs were only 
limited by the fancy and ability of the artist. Both sexes were tattooed 
(Figs. 4, a and b), but the women to a greater extent and with more 
elaborate designs than the men. The material used in tattooing is ob- 
tained by burning the leaf of an indigenous plant called "ti," which is 
moistened with the juice of a berry called "poporo." A tattoo comb 
is made of bone or fish bones fastened to a stick, which is held in posi- 
tion and struck with a sharp blow.

The highest ornamentation was as .follows: A narrow band around

little circles extending down upon ihe forehead and joined to the baud

by a stem. Fr the coronet, a Hue extended around tin- outside edge 

of the car, with a circle on the lobe. The lips were freely tattooed, 
after the manner of the Maoris, with lines curving around the chin and 
extending towards the check hones ; the entire neck and throat covered 
with oblique or wavy lines, with occasional patches of solid coloring; 
a broad, wide girdle (Fig. 1, <i) about the waist, from which hands rise 
in front and behind, representing trees and foliage, surmounted by large 
laces on the breast and back, and smaller ones on each side of the 
body. Below the waist belt the lines were line, like lace-work, and 
from the thigh to the knee the appearance was that of silk tights with 
variegated pattern. Below the knee there were various designs, termi- 
nating in a point at the feet. 

SALUTATION. 

The form of salutation is "Kbhomai," literally interpreted, "Come to 
me." This is always heartily expressed, and parties meeting often 
shout out the kohomai while some distance apart. The greeting is varied 
by the addition of a word of respect when addressed to a superior in 
rank, or a stranger, and by a term of endearment, when to a child or 
to a relation. 

DRESS. 

The costume of the natives is at present made up of the cast-off 
clothing obtained from ships of all nations that have called at the 
island, but principally old uniforms of the French, Spanish, and En- 
glish vesselsof war. Brass buttons appeal strongly to the native love 
for adornment, and many were made happy by the liberal contributions 
from the Mohican. Very little tappa cloth is made on the island at. 
[•resent, but specimens of the ancient handiwork are treasured rip in 
every family. The mode of manufacture is quite similar to that prac- 
ticed on the various groups of the South Sea, but the patterns are 
much less elaborate. The bark is stripped from the branches of the 
Hibiscus, in a manner to obtain the greatest possible length, and rolled 
into coils with the inner bark outside, in order to make it flat and 
smooth. It is then scraped with a piece of obsidian to remove the 
bark, the coils being occasionally soaked in water to remove the res 
inous substances. The strips are laid across a log and beaten for 
many hours with a heavy mallet. The mallets are made of the lieav 
iest and hardest wood that can bft obtained (toromiro), about afoot long 
and .'J inches on each face, some of which are smooth and others 

carved into grooves or ribs, to suit the different stages in the process of 
manufacture. Several strips of bark are beaten into one thickness of 
cloth, according to the purpose for which it was intended, some being 
made quite fine and others coarse and heavy. No gum is used except 
thai naturally contained in the bark, and the fillers adhere closely 

when kept dry. The fabrication of the tappa speaks well for the native 



468 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

invention aud industry, but it is not very durable when compared with 
woven goods. The colors with which the decorations are made are pro- 
cured from roots, leaves, aud berries of indigenous plants and are pre- 
pared with considerable skill. Several kinds of earth are used for the 
dark colors, the pigment being ground down aud boiled in the juice of 
the sugar-cane. 

MATS. 

The natives excel in the manufacture of fine mats, specimens of 
which will be found in our collection. They are made of bulrushes 
obtained from the craters in the vicinity of the lakes formed by the 
collection of the rain-water. They are woven by hand, aud fine speci- 
mens are highly prized. 

AMUSEMENTS. 

The amusements of the people were reduced to a minimum when the 
customs of their heathen forefathers were abandoned, aud at present 
there is no general assemblage for the purpose of enjoyment except an 
occasional marriage feast or some accidental occasion, such as the ar- 
rival of a foreign ship. Prominent among the ancient customs were 
leasts to celebrate the return of the different seasons and various an- 
niversaries in their history, such as the landing of Hotu-Metua at 
Anakena Bay. Upou the latter occasion the ancient traditions were 
repeated by recognized orators, and a prominent feature of all fetes 
was athletic sports, such as running, spear-throwiug, and feats of skill 
and dexterity. Dancing was the most common of all amusemeuts and 
there was no assemblage without its appropriate dance. 

THE NATIVE DANCE. 

Just as the traditions are cherished and repeated from father to son, 
the native dances are remembered and held in esteem, although never 
publicly practiced. Mr. Salmon secured the services of the "star per- 
formers" and we were fortunately enabled to witness the peculiarities 
of the native dauce at his house at Viahu, on the eve of our departure 
from the island. The music was furnished by three persons seated 
upon the floor, who accompanied their discordant voices by thumps 
upon a tomtom improvised from old cracker-boxes, and the dance was 
performed by an old woman aud a young girl, the latter possessing some 
claim to symmetry of figure. The dancers wore a single loose garment, 
short enough to expose the bare ankles and sun-browned feet. Over 
the head and shoulders was thrown a white cloak, composed of a few 
yards of cotton cloth, which was sometimes spread open and occasion- 
ally made to hide the whole figure as they went through the various 
evolutions of the dance. This mantle was not managed with any par- 
ticular skill or grace and seemed to be identified with one particular 



TE PITO TE IlKN'tJA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 4G9 

dance, after which it was discarded for the small dancing-paddle or 
wand. The weird songs related the achievements and exploits of their 
ancestors in war, fishing, and love, and the gestures of the dancers 
were upon this occasion perfectly proper and modest. Some of the 
movements were suggestive of a rude relationship to the dances per- 
formed by the geisha girls of Japan in their odori, and consisted of 
movements and attitudes calculated to display the elegance and grace 
of the performers. The peculiar feature of the native dancing is the 
absence of violent motion ; there is no jumping or elaborate piiouettes, 
no extravagant contortions, and nothing that might be called a precision 
of step. The lower limbs play a part of secondary importance to the 
arms and the dancers indulge in no dizzy gyrations. The feet and 
hands are kept moving in unison with the slow, monotonous music, 
while the dancers endeavor to act out the words of the song by panto- 
mime. These islanders, like their sisters throughout Polynesia, have 
their hula-hula, or dances that partake of passion and abandon, and 
portray the old story of coquetry, jealousy, and ultimate surrender of 
the maiden. Soft swaying movements, a gentle turning away, timid 
glances, and startled gestures, gradually giving place to more rapturous 
passion, speak plainly enough the theme of the song, though the move- 
ments are less graceful and elegant than those which characterize the 
naiitch dances of India. Among the diversified dances, some are per- 
formed by men and others by women, but the sexes rarely if ever dance 
together. Wands are usually held in each hand, but occasionally one 
and sometimes both are discarded. Feather hats and other ornaments 
are worn in portraying characters and some of the dances are said to 
be of obscene tendencies. 

RELIGION. 

Like most savage nations, the Easter Islanders had numerous super- 
stitions and resorted to charms, prayers, incantations, and amulets 
to bring good luck and ward off evil. A thorough delineation of these 
superstitions might be instructive in the light of showing the real depth 
of the religious feeling of those who now profess Christianity as well as 
the capacity of the native mind for entertaining a higher form of civili- 
zation; but, unfortunately, our brief stay on the island did not afford 
time to thoroughly investigate the subject. 

The belief in a future state was a prominent feature in the religion. 
After death the soul was supposed to depart to the " place of departed 
spirits'' to be rewarded by the gods or tormented by the demons. 
With this idea in view a small hole was invariably built in the wall 
near the top of all tombs, cairns, and other receptacles for the dead, by 
Wliich the spirit of the deceased was supposed to find egress. Deified 
spirits were believed to be constantly wandering about the earth and 
to have aiore or less influence over the human affairs. Spirits were, 
supposed to appear to sleeping persons and to communicate with them 
through visions or dreams. 



470 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Gnomes, ghouls, and goblins were believed to inhabit inaccessible 
caves and niches in the rock and to have the power of prowling about 
after dark. The small wooden and stone images known as : ' household 
gods," were made to represent certain spirits and belong to a different 
order from the gods, though accredited with many of the same attri- 
butes. They occupied a prominent place in every dwelling and were 
regarded as the medium through which communications might be made 
with the spirits, but were never worshiped. The Great Spirit Meke- 
Meke is represented by a bird-like animal as referred to in the descrip- 
tion of sculptured rocks and paintings at Orongo. 

SUPERSTITIONS. 

The islanders were superstitious to an extent that was extraordinary, 
and they were constantly under the influence of dread from demons or 
supernatural beings. Fish-hooks were made of bones of deceased fish- 
ermen, which were thought to exert a mysterious influence over the den 
izens of the deep. Fishermen were always provided with the stone god 
that was supposed to be emblematic of the spirit having cognizance of 
the fish. Eocks in certain localities were believed to be under spirit 
taboo, and persons who walked over them were punished with sore feet. 
The leaves of several harmless plants were regarded as prophylactic 
against disease. Stones were buried beneath the doorways of houses 
to guard against evil influences. The native priests were simply 
wizards and sorcerers who professed to have influence with evil spirits 
sufficient to secure by incantations their co-operation in the destruc- 
tion of au enemy, or by occult means gain their aid and good-will for 
the protection of property, crops, etc. The system of taboo corre- 
sponds with the same thing practiced throughout the islands of the 
South Sea, and included a prohibition in regard to persons as well as 
property. The symbol of the taboo on crops properly consisted of a 
small pile of stone placed in the form of a pyramid, or piled one on top 
of the other. The natives have a way of divining the future by means 
of a flower, common enough in more civilized countries but not observed 
before in Polynesia. u Ae" and "Aita" are repeated as the petals are 
thrown away, and the signification appears to be equivalent to the 
"yes," and u iio" of Goethe's Marguerite. 

SACRIFICIAL STONES. 

In the rear of some of the best-preserved platforms are stones said to 
have been erected for sacrificial purposes. These altars consist of a 
single shaft, generally of vesicular lava, but in some cases cut from the 
material of which the images and crowns were made. They range in 
height from 5 to 10 feet, squared to 3i or 4 feet on each face, and stand 
in the center of a terrace paved with smooth bowlders. The sides and 
plinth were covered with figures sculptured in low relief, but are now 
too much weather-worn to be traced. These altars are said to have 



IK ITl'o TE HENUA, OR EASTEK ISLAND. 471 

been designed and used for human sacrifices, but of this a reasonable, 
doubt may be expressed. The form is inconveniently adapted to the 
purpose and the stones differ in all respects from those used for the same 
purpose in the other islands. Evidences of fire on top of stones were 
plain enough, but no charred bones were found except those <>!' recent 
date belonging to sheep and cattle. 

DISEASES AND THEIR TREATMENT. 

The practice of relieving pain by manipulation of the body was the 
effective movement cure resorted toby the islanders years before the 
Swedish or massage treatment assumed its present prominence. With- 
out entering upon the question of how valuable the practice of lomi-lotni 
may be as a cure for ailments, I may testily to the physical regeneration 
of this titillant manipulation. On more that one occasion I have thrown 
myself upon the ground, completely exhausted by over- exertion, and 
yielded to the dexterous kneadings and frictions and palmings and 
pinchings of those skilled in the treatment. The hard-listed native is 
by no means gentle in the operation, but with palms and knuckles 
vigorously tests every muscle and tendon, as well as every joint of the 
vertebra-, until the exhausted patient sinks into a state of oblivious 
somnolence. 

Several of the plants indigenous to the island were considered valua- 
ble remedies for certain ailments, but the chief therapeutic art of the 
native practitioner was the pretended exercise of powers of divination. 
The application of herbs, simples, and the practiceof lomi lomi were 
perhaps not sufficient distinction, and therefore a claim was made for 
occult knowledge and supernatural power. 

The native pharmcopceia is extremely limited in its scope. The thistle 
is bruised and applied to sores and ulcers, arrowroot for burns, and 
a species of nightshade is used as a vulnerary remedy. On this breeze- 
swept island diseases of a paludal nature are unknown. 

A mild type of remittent fever is common during the rainy season 
from April to October, but nature is left to light its battles without 
assistance. Rheumatism and pulmonary complaints occasioualy result 
from long exposure to inclement weather, but as a rule no medical treat- 
ment is attempted. 

The natives believe that a disease called "kino," or cracked feet, 
results iron i walking over the rocks along the shore at Tahai. Probably 
the trouble arises from cuts and abrasions coming in contact with a 
succulent vine that grows ;it this place.

terial and patience on the pari of t he operator. A poiuted stick of hard

or fiber thrown up at the end of the groove. This is blown into a flame, 
and dried grass added to it until the lire i.s sufficiently established. 
The difficulty of preserving suitable material in a perfectly dry state 
led to the custom of keeping up a perpetual fire in each community. 
These vestal tires were kept up by persons appointed for that purpose, 
though it does not appear that they were vestal virgins. Caves afford- 
ing ample protection from the weather were selected for the location of 
these permanent fires, and although they had no religious significance, 
the flames were as carefully watched and attended as the celestial fire 
of the followers of Zoroaster. 

OANNFBALISM. 

The traditions abound with instances of authropophagism, and in all 
Polynesia there were no more confirmed cannibals than these islanders. 
The practice is said to have originated with a band of natives who were 
defeated in war and besieged in their stronghold until reduced to the 
borders of starvation. From this time the loathsome custom of devour- 
ing prisoners, captured in war, grew in popular favor. Cannibalism may 
have originated in a spirit of revenge, but it grew beyond those limits, 
and not only were prisoners of war and enemies slain in battle eaten, 
but every unfortunate against whom trivial charges were made met that 
fate. lustances are related in the legends of children being devoured 
by their parents, not from any other motive than to satisfy the crav- 
ings of their depraved and vitiated appetites. Cannibalism was prac- 
ticed until a comparatively recent period. Several of the older natives 
acknowledge that they had frequently eaten human flesh in their youth, 
and described the process of cooking and preparing "long-pig" for the 
feast. 

GOVERNMENT. 

The ancient government of Easter Island was an arbitrary monarchy. 
The supreme authority was vested in a king and was hereditary in 
his family. The person of the king was held sacred. Clan fights and 
internecine struggles were common, but the royal person and family 
were unmolested. The king reigned over the entire island and was not 
disturbed by the defeat or the victory of any of the clans. The island 
was divided into districts having distinct names and governed by chiefs, 
all of whom acknowledged the Supremacy of the king. The title of 
chief was also hereditary, and descended from father to son, but the 
king reserved the right to remove or put to death any of them and of 
naming a successor from the people of the clan. 

There was no confederation, each clan being independent of all the 
rest, except as the powerful are naturally dominant over the weak. The 
chiefs wore peculiar feather hats to denote their rank, and they pre- 
sided at feasts and councils in the absence of the king. Other grades 
of rank were recognized, such as that required by feats of valor, public 



IE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAM). 473 

service rendered, such as image making, etc, but this privileged class 

had no authority vested in them over their fellows. Personal security 
and the rights of private property were little regarded, and disputes 
were settled by king or chief without regard to law or justice. There 
was no code of laws, the people avenged their own injuries, and per- 
sons who incurred the displeasure of the rider were marked as victims 
for sacrifice. It docs not appear that any great homage was paid the 
king, and no tax was exacted of the people. Long-continued custom 
was accepted as law, and defined the few duties and privileges of the 
private citizen. 

Maurata, the last of along line of kings, together with all of the prin- 
cipal chiefs of the islands was kidnapped by the Peruvians ami died 
in slavery. Since that time there has been no recognized authority 
among the natives; every man is his own master, and looks out for his 
own interests. 

In 1863-'C4 the natives were converted to Christianity by Frere Eu- 
gene, a Jesuit missionary. A Frenchman called Dutron -Hornier had 
settled upon the island and started an extensive (arm, and a conflict of 
authority sprang up between the two foreigners, which led to bitter 
tends between the natives. Dutrou-Hornier lived with a common wo- 
man, who had been the wife of* a chief, and he succeeded in having her 
proclaimed queen of the island, under the name of Korato. A system 
of espionage and intrigue was instituted by Queen Korato, guided by 
the Frenchman's instructions, which resulted in an (.pen rebellion 
against the ecclesiastical authority. The missionary was finally com- 
pelled to leave the island, and he removed to Gambier Archipelago 
with about three hundred of his followers, giving Dutrou-Hornier and 
Queen Korato a clear field. The Frenchman was killed in August, 187G, 
by being thrown from his horse while drunk, and Queen Korato and her 
two children survived him only a few years. Mr. Salmon found upon 
his arrival that none of the natives had assumed authority over his 
fellows, and in due course that gentleman became to all intents and 
purposes the king of the island, ruling the people with kindness and 
wisdom and thus securing their unbounded respect and esteem. 

I1URIAL OF THE DEAD. 

Hundreds of tombs, cairns, platforms, and catacombs were examined 
during our stay on the island, and in all cases the bodies were lying 
at full length. In a vault beneath platform No. 1 1 are a number of 
skulls packed together in sufficient quantity to completely fill the com- 
partment — trophies of war perhaps, in view of the fact that the skulls 
were those of adults; but in no single instance did we discover the re- 
mains doubled up as the Eneas and other American aborigines were in 
the habit of burying their dead. In the early ages it was the custom 

to wrap the corpse in dried gra88, bound together by a mat made of 
sedge, and whether laid in platform, cairn, or cave, the body was 



474 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1880. 

usually laid with the head towards the sea. Succeeding generations 
substituted tappa or native cloth for the sedge mat, and the present 
people are sufficiently civilized to prefer rude coffins when the material 
can be obtained. Cemeteries were located by the missionaries near the 
churches at Vailur and Mateveri, and strong efforts made to discourage 
the burial of converted natives with their heathen ancestors, but they 
were never able to overcome their aversion to promiscuous interment. 

BOATS. 

Hofn Matua is said to have landed upon the island with three hun- 
dred followers m two canoes, which are described in the traditions as 
90 feet in length and (i feet deep (draught of water). From the descrip- 
tion given of these boats and the representations found of them among 
the mural paintings and sculptures in certain caves, the canoes of the 
original settlers were quite similar to the Fiji war-canoes. They were 
constructed of many pieces of wood neatly fitted together and field in 
place by thongs or lashings; high and sharp at both ends and bal- 
anced by an outrigger or smaller canoe. Such boats are in use at the 
present time in many of the Polynesian islands and are quite capable 
of making long voyages at sea. The boats built by succeeding gener- 
ations were few in number and small in size, on account of the scarcity 
of material to be found on the island. Many of the early navigators 
refer to the scarcity of boats belonging to the natives. Captain Cook 
saw several canoes, 10 or 12 feet long, built of pieces 4 or 5 inches 
wide, and not more than 2 or 3 feet long, but th.e majority of his 
native visitors swam off to his ship. Captain Beechey saw three canoes 
on the beach, but they were not launched. Yon Kotzebue saw three 
canoes each containing two men. At the time of our visit the only 
boats on the island were two large ones, belonging to Messrs. Salmon 
and Brander. built of material obtained from the wrecks on the coast. 
There are no canoes in use at the present time, but we found two very 
old ones in a cave on the west coast, having long ago passed their days 
of usefulness ou the water and now serving as burial cases. They 
were a patchwork of several kinds of wood sewed together, and though 
in an advanced stage of dry-rot the material was sufficiently well pre- 
served to prove that it never grew ou Easter Island, but had been ob- 
tained from the drift-wood on the beach. 

WEAPONS AND "WAR. 

The native weapons in offensive and defensive operations were lim- 
ited to obsidian-pointed spears, short clubs, and the throwing-stones, 
but these were handled with remarkable skill and dexterity. The his- 
tory of the simple weapons in the hands of people who became pre- 
eminent in their use has been repeated in all ages and countries, and 
is fully exemplified in these islanders; though their primitive spear, 



ii. I'iro TE EtENUA, Ofi i'.asilii tSLAND. 47. r ) 

lacking the metal-piercing medium, could never aspire to the fame of 
the gladiator's l rid cut, the Homeric javelin, the I Join an pilum, the Turk- 
ish jereed, the Landsknecht's halberd, the Polish lance, the Zulu assa- 
gai, or even the knobkerry of the Amazuln. The formidable weapon of 
the ancient Parthian, still wielded by the dexterous Turcoman, was mil 
known to these islanders. Arrows might have been improvised, lint 
there was no wood in their possession suitable for the manufacture of 
hows. 

Unlike the, Fijians and other Polynesians to the westward, who did 
great execution with their long war clubs, these natives used in fight- 
ing only the patoopatoo, or the mere, like that of the, Maori, except thai 
they were invariably made of wood. They possessed a long club, a lit- 
tle expanded and flattened at one end,. and the other carved into a head 
with a double face with eyes made of obsidian and bone; but this was 
carried as a baton of oflice before the chiefs and used only for that pur- 
pose. 

Stones were thrown with great precision and accuracy from the hand, 
and the use of a sling, such as made David more than a match for the 
gigantic Philistine, appears to have been unknown. Slings were com- 
mon among the hie as and other races of South America from the earli- 
est times, but no traces of such an appliance could be found on Easter 
Island, either in the tombs or mentioned by the ancient traditions. 

A want of practice his probably made the natives of to-day less pro- 
licient in stone-throwing than their forefathers, bnt if the stories may 
he believed, the time was when their truculent address could only have 
been surpassed by Runjeet Singh's Akalis in flinging the chuckkra. 

Several of the ancient traditions speak of a net being used in fight- 
ing, and men were especially trained in its use, but whether they re- 
sembled the old Roman retiarius can not be discovered, the custom 
having long since died out. It is unknown to the natives of to-day. 

Two kinds of spears were used, one about <> feet long for throwing and 
the other a shorter one; a heavier stabbing pike was only lit for use al 
close quarters. In its original form the spear was essentially a missile, 
ami the traditions speak of the adoption of the thrusting weapon in the 
desperate engagements that resulted in the extermination of the "long- 
eared race." The shafts were made of pouron Hibiscus sp. and hi Dracaena 
terminalis, and the various forms of obsidian points were secured by a 
lashing made from the indigenous hem]). The javelins were thrown 
underhanded with the little finger foremost, but they did not have 
that peculiar vibratory motion that distinguished the Zulu assagai. 

Nothing was known of a retrieving weapon, such as the boomerang of 
the Australians, or even the throwing-sticks of the Eskimo tribes on 
the const of Alaska. # 

There Was no class of professional fighters Or soldiers: every able- 
bodied limn was supposed to be u warrior and compelled to do duly in 
time of war. Fighting men were not trained or drilled, except that 



s 



476 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

throwing stones and darting the spear were favorite amusements and 
always a prominent feature of all feasts. The clans were always led to 
battle by the chief, but there was no particular formation. Every man 
acted in accordance with his individual fancy, or as occasion demanded, 
relying upon skill and strength alone. No shields were used and no 
particular efforts were made to parry the weapons of the enemy. 

In view of the fact that the islanders all acknowledged the authority 
of one king, their wars were surprisingly numerous, barbarous, and un- 
relenting. The traditions are filled with accounts of sanguinary con- 
flicts originating from trivial causes and continued through genera- 
tions, until one party or the other were entirely exterminated. The 
slaughter on the field of battle was never very great, but in the event 
of a general defeat, the vanquished party was pursued by the victor? 
to the hiding places, their habitations destroyed, females captured, 
children and infirm persons brutally murdered. The defenseless un- 
fortunates who fell victims to their merciless captors, accepted their 
fate, whether it was slavery, torture, or butchery, with remarkable for- 
titude, seldom if ever making any show of resistance. 

EXPLORATION OF THE ISLAND. 

Thejl/o/n'mwcametoanchorin the roadstead of HangaRoa(PlateX\ T I) 
on the morning of Saturday, December 18, 1886. The individuals most 
interested in the exploration of the island went on shore without delay, 
and the work was pushed forward as rigorously as possible until the 
hour appointed lor the sailing of the ship for Valparaiso on the even- 
ing of the last day of the year. 

Messrs. Salmon and Brander boarded the ship upon her arrival and ex- 
tended the hospitalities of Easter Island, placing their limited resources 
entirely at our command with a heartiness that won our immediate es- 
teem, and which ripened into sincere friendship before our departure. 
These gentlemen are closely connected with the royal family of Tahiti, 
and we had been intrusted with letters and various articles from rela- 
tives and friends who desired to embrace the opportunity for commu- 
nication offered by the Mohican. 

Upon lauding at Hanga Koa we found nearly all of the natives on 
the island congregated to receive their unknown visitors. The men in- 
spected us closely and were profuse in friendly demonstrations, while 
their wives and daughters gazed curiously from a little distance, and 
the children's manner plainly showed the enjoy meut of an occasion of 
infrequent occurrence in their quiet lives. Surrounded by this crowd 
we walked about a mile to the house of Mr. Biauder, where the bag- 
gage, tools, and impedimenta in general were deposited. During the 
afternoon a reconnaissance was made to the crater of liana Kao and the 
aucfent stone houses in the vicinity, and in the evening we crossed the 
island in a light wagon with Mr. Salmon to his residence at Vaihu. 
That gentleman has, during his long residence on the island, accumu-

lated a valuable collection of curios and relics of tb.e former inhab- 
itants. Nearly all of our first uight on shore was devoted to the pur- 
chase and cataloguing of specimens from Mr. Salmon's collection, all of 
which will be referred to and described elsewhere. Duplicates were 
obtained of all articles furnished Lieut. Commander Geisler, of the 
Ih/ane, for the museum at Berlin, and of those collected by the Topaze 
for the British Museum, together with original tablets and other lelies 
of great interest and value that had escaped the attention of former 
collectors. 

RECONNAISANOE TO RANA KAO. 

Sunday, December 19. — Made an early start from Vaihu and rode to 
the central elevations called Mount Teraai, Mount Punapau, and Mount 
Tuatapu and inspected the quarries from whence the red tufa was ob- 
tained which formed the crowns or head-dresses that ornamented all 
the huge images. Following the road to the southwest we made the 
ascent of Ban a Kao. The crater is nearly circular and about a mile in 
diameter (Plate XVII), with steep jagged sides, or walls, except on the 
south, where the lava-flow escaped to the. sea. A lake fills the bottom of 
what was once the volcanic caldron ; the water is of great depth and the 
surface covered with a coat of peat, so dense and strong that cattle range 
over it, finding food at irregular intervals. The surface of the lake is 
about TOO feet from the top, but the cattle have made a path by which 
the descent can be made with safety. 

Skirting the edge of the crater to the southward the ridge becomes 
narrower, falling precipitously a thousand feet to the sea on one side, 
and descending abruptly into the crater on the other until it terminates 
in an elongated wall of rock rising to a sharp, jagged edge impassable to 
cither man or beast. Just where this elevated edge contracts rapidly 
towards the south are located the ancient stone-houses of Ordngo. 
(Plate XVIII). These burrow-like dwellings were built with little regard 
to sheets, avenues, etc., but were regulated by the contour of the land. 
Piles of debris in one or two spots marked the destroying hand of former 
investigators, but the large majority of the houses were intact, and in 
some instances the openings had been sealed up with stone, making it 
difficult to outline the original entrances. These dwellings were con- 
structed without windows or other openings except a door-way so low 
and narrow that an entrance could only be effected by crawling upon the 
hands and knees, while in many eases it was necessary to creep sei pent- 
like through the contracted confines. Many interiors were inspected 
bythelight of candles provided for the purpose and houses marked for 
thorough investigation on the morrow. 

While tracing and sketching the sculptured rocks in the vicinity of 
Orongo, the declining sun hastened the departure for Vaihu, where t lie 
bouts after our evening meal were devoted to making notes of the native 
traditions as translated by Mr. Salmon, until that good-natured gentle-

in an could be kept awake no longer. It had been proposed that we 
should occupy one of the ancient stone houses for the night, in order to 
be near the scene of operations planned for the next day, but they were 
damp and ill-smelling and the work accomplished on the traditions 
more than repaid the time lost in recrossing the island. 

THE ANCIENT STONE HOUSE AT OKONGO. 

December 20. — Leaving Vaihu at early daylight we arrived at Hanga 
Roain time to meet the detachment of eight selected men sent on shore 
from the ship with proper tools and implements for making a thorough 
exploration of Orougo and vicinity. (Plate XIX). The blue-jackets 
scampered up the slope of Eana Kao with the buoyant spirits of school- 
boys out for a holiday, and arriving at the spot were anxious to lend 
the assistance of willing hands and plenty of brawn to the prosecution 
of the work. 

Every house was entered and inspected, though occasionally a mis- 
calculation was made in the dimensions of a narrow passage-way and it 
became necessary to rescue a prisoner by dragging him back by the 
heels. Once inside the building, the interior could be easily inspected 
and sketches made of frescoes and sculptured figures. (Plate XX). 

These remarkable habitations were built against a terrace of earth or 
rock, which in some cases formed the back wall of the dwelling (Fig. 5). 
From this starting point a wall was constructed of small slabs of strat- 
ified basaltic rock, piled together without cement and of a thickness 
varying from about 3 feet to a massive rampart of 7 feet in width. 




Fig. 5. 

View ok stone hut in Okongo. 

The outer entrance is formed by short stone posts planted in the 
ground and crossed by a basaltic slab. The passage-way was in all 
cases unpaved and usually lined on the top and both sides with flat 
stones. This important feature added materially to our comfort while 
forcing an entrance through some of the narrow openings, and saved the 
necessity for adding to our already bountiful supply of bruises and abra- 
sions. Xo regularity of plan is shown in the construction of the ma- 
jority of the houses; some are parallelogram in shape, others elliptical, 
and many are iinmethodieal, showing a total absence of design, the 
builder being guided by the conformation of the ground, the amount 
of material available, and other chance circumstances. These houses

are roofed with slabs of rock of sufficient length to span the side walls, 
showing that no particular care had been exercised to form close joiuts! 
Over this stoue ceiling t lie earth was piled in mound- shape, reaching 
a depth in the center of from 1 t<» <i feet, and covered by a sod that 
afforded ample protection from raiu. The floors were the hare earth, 
and the interiors were damp and moldy from insufficient ventilation 
afforded by the single contracted opening. 

An accurate measurement of these remarkable structures gave the 
average height from floor to ceiling -1- feet (> inches; thickness of 
walls, 1 feet to 10 inches; width of rooms, 1 feet <> inches; length of 
rooms, L2 feet inches; average size of doorways, height 20 inches, 
width 19 inches. In making the survey of Orongo the houses were

numbered from 1 to 49, inclusive, commencing al the inshore extremity 
(Fig. 0). While in the majority of instances the interior dimensions 
were considerably below the average given above, several of the houses 
exceeded fhose limits, particularly in the length of the rooms. The 



480 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

largest bouse contained a single chamber nearly 40 feet lone - ; three 
were over 30 feet, and eight measured over 20 feet in length, with other 
dimensions approximately the same as the general average. These rude 
dwellings were not in all cases confined to a single apartment; some 
have one and a few have two or three recess chambers opening out of 
the main room ; but they were dark little dens, having no separate light 
or ventilation. 

Near the center of this assemblage of houses there is a sort of square 
court with eight door- ways opening upon it. These might be considered 
separate and distinct dwellings, though the apartments are connected 
by interior passage-ways, making it possible to pass from one to the 
other. At the extreme end of the point a similar collection of houses 
opens upon a circular court, and the interiors are also connected. 

In front of each house and about 10 feet from the door-way, small ex- 
cavations lined with slabs of stone, making holes about a foot wide and 
2 feet long and about 20 inches deep, indicated the culinary arrange- 
ments of the former inhabitants. The modus operandi of prepariug the 
food was primitive in the extreme; a fire was built in the rude oven 
and removed when the stones were sufficiently heated, a covering of 
damp earth being placed over the oven to retard the radiation of heat. 

Thorough examination demonstrated the fact that these peculiar 
houses were not precisely alike in all respects, though thesame general 
characteristics prevailed. Those at the extreme point of the ridge 
(Plate XXI) bear evidence of great antiquity, and much excavation was 
necessary before a satisfactory examination could be made of the door- 
posts or stone supports to the entrances, which were covered with hiero- 
glyphics and rudely carved figures. From houses numbered 2, 3, and 
4 ( Fig 6) on Lieutenant Sy mond's chart of Orongo, were taken samples of 
these sculptures for the National Museum. The large beach pebbles 
were obtained by digging to a depth of 2 feet below the door-posts, and 
are of considerable interest both from the dense nature of the mateiial 
and the fact that these carvings were found frequently repeated through- 
out the island. 

The majority of the houses at Orongo are in a fair state of pieserva- 
tion and bear evidence of having been occupied at no very remote pe- 
riod. The result of the investigation here showed very little of carving 
on stone, but the smooth slabs lining the walls and ceilings were orna- 
mented with mythological figures and rude designs painted in white, 
red, and black pigments. Houses marked 1, 5, and G on Lieutenant 
Symoud's chart were demolished at the expense of great labor and the 
frescoed slabs obtained. Digging beneath the door-posts and under the 
floors produced nothing beyond a few stone implements. 

The houses in this vicinity occupy such a prominent position that 
they were naturally robbed of everything in the way of relics by the 
natives, who were beginning to appreciate the value of such things 
through the importance placed upon them by the foreign vessels that

have called at the island. A niche in the wall of each of these dwell- 
ing's was evidently designed to receive tbe household god and the va- 
rious valuables which were possessed by the inhabitants. Whatever 
treasures they may have held in former years, we found them empty, 
and our search revealed nothing of importance. 
• Attention was directed to one of the buildings in t his assemblage thai 
apparently had no entrance way. One wall was demolished, disclosing 
a rude coffin containing the remains of a native recently deceased. 
The unoccupied house had been utilized as a tomb, and sealed up with 
the material of which the walls were built. 

SCULPTURED ROCKS. 

The most important sculptured rocks on this island (Plate XXII) are 
in the immediate vicinity of the stone houses at Urongo (Fig. 7). As

much time as possible was devoted to examining and sketching these 
curious relics. The hard volcanic rock is covered by carvings intended 
to represent human faces, birds, fishes, ami mythical animals, all very 
much defaced by the ravages of time and the elements (Plate XXIII). 

The apparent age of some of the rock-carvings antedates the neighbor- 
ing stone houses, the images, and other relics of the island except the 
ruined village on the bluff west of Kotatake Mountain. Fishes and 
turtles appear frequently among these sculptures, but the most common 
figure is a mythical animal, half human in form, with bowed back and 
long claw like legs and arms. According to the natives, this symbol was

rocks, bore a striking resemblance to the decoration on a piece of pot- 
tery which I once dug up in Pern, while making excavations among the 
graves of the Incas. The form is nearly identical, but, except in this 
instance, no similarity was discovered between the relics of Easter Is- 
land aud the coast of South America. 

ANCIENT CUSTOMS IN RELATION TO GATHERING THE SEA-BIRDS EGGS. 

From the most reliable information that could be obtained, the stone 
houses at Orongo were built for the accommodation of the natives while 
celebrating the festival of the "sea birds eggs," from a remote period 
until the advent of the most important ceremonies. 

During the winter months, sea-birds in great numbers visit the Is- 
land to lay their eggs and to bring forth (heir young. The nests are 
made among the ledges and cliffs of the inaccessible rocks, but a favor- 
ite spot for these birds has always been the tiuy islands Mutu EauKau 
and Mutu Nui, lying a few hundred yards from the southwest point of 
the island (Plate XXIV). Here the first eggs of the season are laid, aud 
therefore Orongo was selected as a convenient point to watch for the 
coming of the birds. According to the ancient custom, the fortunate 
individual who obtained possession of the first e^g and returned with 
it unbroken to the expectant crowd, became entitled to certain privi- 
leges and rights during the following year. No especial authority was

vested in him, but it was supposed thai he had won the approval of 
the great spirit " Meke Meke" and was entitled to receive contributions 

of food and other considerations from his fellows. The race for the dis- 
tinguished honor of bearing off the first egg was an occasion of intense. 
excitement. The contestants were held in cheek at Orongo until the 
auspicious moment arrived, and the scramble commenced at the word 
"go," pronounced by the king, who was about the only able-bodied man 
on the island who did not participate. It was decidedly a go asyou- 
please race, every man selecting his route to the sea by the circuitous 
paths or directly over the face of the cliff, and many fatal falls are re- 
corded as the result. 

The swim to Mutu Bau Kau was a trifling matter, the chief difficulty 
being to return with an egg unbroken through the general scramble. 

The houses at Orongo were probably unoccupied except for a short 
period in July of each year while awaiting the coming of the sea-birds. 
The peculiarity of their construction might be accounted for by the fact 
that the thatched hut, common to the plains, could not be used to ad- 
vantage on this exposed bluff. The low, contracted entrances, were used 
here as well as elsewhere Cor defense. Factional fights were common 
and it was necessary that every house should be guarded against sur- 
prise and easily defended. Another reason might be found for making 
the openings as small as possible, in the absence of doors to shut out 
the storms. The sculptured rocks in the vicinity of Orongo bear record 
of the grateful contestants in the egg-races to the great spirit "Meke 
Meke" for his benign influence and protection, much after the manner 
in which boats, pictures, and other objects are dedicated to certain pa- 
tron saints in more civilized portions of the earth. 

EMPLOYMENT OP NATIVES. 

The investigations in the vicinity of Orongo having been (hushed, a 
contract was made with Mr. Brander for removing from the excavations 
and transporting to the landing-place the frescoed slabs, inscribed door- 
posts, and objects collected, ami the evening was devoted to the native 
traditions until exhausted nature demanded a few hours rest. With a 
view of propitiating the natives and securing their goodwill and "Co- 
operation in prosecuting the work with the utmost dispatch, a number 
of men were employed toassisl in the excavations made at Orongo, bul 
the experiment proved a failure. They constituted themselves an ap- 
preciative audience, and could not be induced to work. They evinced 
a lively interest in all that was going on, aud performed astounding gas- 
tronomic feats at mealtime. We concluded to dispense with their serv- 
ices after a demonst rat ion of their dexterity in causing the disappear- 
ance of every small object that remained unprotected for a moment. 
Several of the. head-men, afterwards employed as guides to accompany 
the expedition around the island, and stimulated with the hope of bounti- 



484 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

ful rewards, performed valuable service in the way of locating water- 
holes, identifying localities, naming objects of interest, etc. 

December 21. — Preparations were made for an early start on the ex- 
pedition already planned. The native contingent was dispatched about 
daylight with camp equipage and instructions to form Camp Mohican at 
a spot where it was reported good water could be found in abundance. 
We were somewhat handicapped for the march by the fatigue of the 
last few days, added to the want of rest. The hospitality of the Brauder 
establishment had been cordially extended, but such a large and varied 
assortment of insects and noxious animals had possession of the premises, 
that we preferred the open air, though there were several passing showers 
during the night. A working party from the ship, consisting of nine 
men, including a boatswain's mate and quartermaster, landed at an early 
hour, each man equipped with knapsack, canteen, shovel and pick. 
The expedition took the road passing through the villages of Mataveri 
and Hanga Koa to the coast, followed by almost every man, woman, and 
child on the island. The interest displayed by the natives in our move- 
ments gradually died out after a few hours of hard walking, and towards 
uoon the last party returned to their homes, leaving us a clear field. 

Following the coast-line to the northwest, every part of the ground 
was carefully examined, platforms measured and plotted, excavations 
made, and objects of interest collected and catalogued. 

Near Auahoirangaroa Point, on seme ledges of hard volcanic rock we 
found numerous depressions that evidently were made at the cost of 
great labor. Some are elliptical in shape, others perfectly circular, 
averaging about 3 feet in diameter and 2 feet deep. The majority are 
above high water Hue and others just awash when the tide is full. No 
explanation could be obtained in regard to these holes, and it was con. 
eluded that they were originally intended as live-boxes for the preser- 
vation of fish. 

The natives have a superstition to the effect that any one who walks 
over these rocks will be afflicted with sore feet, and we received many 
solemn warnings in regaid to it. If there is any foundation for it at 
all, it is probably due to a succulent vine that grows here, coming in 
contact with the wounds caused by the sharp rocks. A short dis- 
tance farther on stands a round tower 12 feet in diameter and 20 feet 
high (Fig. 9), said to have been erected as a lookout station from whence 
the movements of turtles could be watched. We found here, as well 
as under every other pile of stones of any description on the island, 
tombs and receptacles for the dead, all filled with human remains in 
various stages of decay, from freshly interred bodies to the bones that 
crumbled into dust upon exposure to the air. The entire island seems to 
be one vast necropolis, and the platforms along the sea-coast appear to 
have been the favorite burial places in all ages. Natural caves were 
utilized as places of deposit for the dead. 

Considerable time was devoted to the examination of the platforms,

and in iiihiicoiis instances interesting catacombs and tombs were dis- 
covered, containiug remains of great antiquity. In this connection a 
peculiar trail in tbe native character was developed. Towards even- 
ing one of the native guides returned to pilot t he working party to the 
place selected for the camp, just at the time a particularly old tomb had 
been uncovered and the crania were being removed from their former 
resting place. This the unsophisticated native took in at a glance, 
and with the announcement that we were desecrating the burial place 
of his forefathers, he set up a howl of despair, and became prostrated 
with grief at the sight of a skull which he claimed to recognize as that 
of his great-grandfather. Notwithstanding the absurdity of the state- 
ment, the angnish displayed induced us to return the bones to their 
ancient resting place. The afflicted youth quickly dried his eyes, and 
intimated that for a suitable reward he would be willing to dispose of 
the remains of his ancestors, and he thought that a consideration of 
about $2 wonld assuage his grief. That settled it. The skulls were 
gathered into the collection, and the sorrowing native left to mourn the 
loss both of the money and of the bones of his forefathers.

found one of octagon shape that stood the test of measurement very 
well. Between platforms 4 and 5 the laud falls away gently to the sea, 
and this slope is paved regularly with small round bowlders, having 
every appearance of having been constructed as a way for hauling out 
boats. The coast iu this vicinity is perfectly rock-bound, but a narrow 
channel extends from the paved way out to sea. Boats might land 
here at any time. With the wind southeast, or in any direction ex- 
cept west, the landing would be perfectly smooth. The place is admir- 
ably adapted to the landing of heavy weights, but, as far as known, the 
images were never transported by sea, nor did the islanders possess 
boats sufficiently large to float them, or material from which they could 
be constructed. 

CAVE AND TOMB NEAR AHUAKAPU POINT. 

On the face of the cliff near the point, Ahuakapu, a large and inter- 
esting cave, was visited. Many of the recesses and angles had been 
walled up and contained human remains. Fossiliferous specimens of 
marine animals were obtained by digging up the floor of the cave. The 
igneous rocks in the vicinity show evidences of rude sculptures, among 
which could be traced canoes, fishes, and men in various attitudes. Upon 
the extreme point we found another one of those round towers, built 
for the purpose of observing the movements of turtles on the beach. 
The shaft measures 24£ feet, and stands in the center of a narrow plat- 
form G7 feet long, filled with tombs containing human remains that had 
long been undisturbed, as evidenced by a luxuriant growth of lichens 
on the rough rocks, 

RUINS OF THE OLDEST HABITATION ON THE ISLAND. 

On the high bluff west of Kotatake Mountain we discovered the ruins 
of a settlement extending more than a mile along the coast line and in- 
land to the base of the hill. These remains bear unmistakable evidences 
of being the oldest habitations on the island. The houses are elliptical in 
shape, with door-ways facing the sea, and were built of uncut stoue. 
Some of the walls are standing, but the majority are scattered about 
in the utmost confusion. An extremely interesting feature of these an- 
cient ruins is the fact that each dwelling was provided with a small cave 
or niche at the rear end, built of loose lava stones, which was in a number 
of instances covered by an arch supported by a fairly shaped key-stone. 
The recesses were undoubtedly designed to contain the household gods, 
and the key-stone, although extremely rough in construction, is unmis- 
takable in its application. Our guides had no knowledge of this locality 
and knew no distinctive name for it. 

Messrs. Salmon and Brander had not visited the spot, because the 
location is bleak and desolate and, as far as they had heard, was a track- 
less waste, devoid of all interest. 



TE JHENUA, 01? I \.STEB ISLAND 487 

Camp .Mohican was formed a few hundred yards in the rear of plat- 
form No. 7. We reached the spot jus' as the shades of night were ci 
ing in. toot-sore and weary from the hard day's inarch. The camp was 
noi more than 5 miles in a direct line from our starting point in the 
morning, but we had traveled many times the distance in making a 
thorough inspection of the ground. A narrow pathway follows the 
coast line tor a part of the distance, which affords safe footing for 
the natives ; everywhere else the ground is covered with volcanic rocks 
of every conceivable size and shape, making the walking both difficult 
and dangerous. The site for the camp was selected because of the prox- 
imity of a water-hole, the only one to be found in this neighborhood* 
it proved to be a shallow cave where the rain-water collected from the 
drainage of the surrounding hills ; the fluid was full of both animal and 
vegetable matter and decidedly unpleasant to taste and smell. A shel- 
ter-tent was improvised by suspending a blanket: at the ends from board- 
ing pikes planted in the ground, and altera hasty meal all hands sought 
the much needed rest. About midnight ominous looking clouds rolled 
up from the southeast, and it rained in heavy squalls until morning, Wet 
and unrefresbed, we turned out at daylight to resume the march with 
everything completely saturated from underclothing to note-books, but 
with undaunted resolution to continue the work in spite of the ele- 
ments. 

Platforms 7 and 8 are within a few hundred yards of each other and 
close to the vilixe of the bluff, which is at this point 390 feet above the 
sea level, from beneath these ancient piles many interesting speci- 
mens of crania were obtained, together with obsidian spear-heads and 
stone implements. An extensive settlement must have been located 
here at a comparatively recent period. Narrow curbing stones indi- 
cated the position of the houses. These stones had been squared, with 
2 inch holes sunk in the upper face at short intervals to receive the 
ends of the poles that supported the thatched roof. These dwellings 
had been built upon terraces descending towards the sea, and though 
they differed greatly in size, the same characteristics were preserved in 
all cases. The Style of architecture must have been suggested by an 
inverted canoe. The curbing walls of the house in the center of this 
collection measured 124 feet in length, L2 feet wide in the center, and 
converging to 15 inches at the ends. 

NATURAL CAVES. 

Among some outcropping rocks near by, a cave was accidentally dis- 
covered, with a mouth so small that an entrance was effected with dif- 
ficulty. Once inside, however, it branched out into spacious chambers 
that could shelter thousands of people \\ ith comfort, it bore evident 
of having been used in former years as a dwelling-place, and probably 
had other entrances and extensions which we failed to penetrate for the 



488 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

want of time. Human remains were found in this cave, but all very 
old. 

The caves of Easter Island are numerous and extremely interesting 
in character. They may be divided into two classes : those worn by the 
action of the waves, and those due to the expansion of gases in the 
molten lava and other volcanic action. The process of attrition is in 
constant progress around the entire coast-line, and the weaker portions 
of the rock are being undermined by the incessant beating of the ocean. 
Some of these sea- worn caves are of considerable extent, but generally 
difficult of access and affording little of interest except to the geologist. 
The caverns produced by volcanic agencies are found throughout this 
island, and some were traced through subterranean windings to an out- 
let on the bluffs overlooking the sea. They are generally quite dry; 
the rain-water falling upon the surface occasionally finds its way be- 
tween the cracks or joints in the solid rock, but these gloomy passages 
and chambers lack grandeur from the entire absence of stalactites and 
deposits of carbonate of lime, iso glistening and fantastical forms of 
stalagmitic decorations exist here to excite the fancy and create iu the 
imagination scenes of fairy-like splendor. The feeble rays of our can- 
dles were quickly absorbed by the somber surroundings, heightening 
the apparent extent and gloom of the recesses. Careful investigation 
proved that all of the caves visited had been used as dwelling-places 
by the early inhabitants. 

Platform 18 deserved more attention than we were able to give to it, 
the facing-stones having been torn from their original position in the 
structure and lying scattered about as though thrown down by some 
great convulsion of nature. Some of them show evidences of having 
been ornamented with rude figures carved on the hard rocks; but the 
approach of sundown hastened our steps toward Motukau Point, where 
we could see the flags flying over our camp. The day's march had been 
exceedingly fatiguing on account of the rugged nature of the ground 
and the absence of water, but the last mile or so was accomplished at 
a swinging pace in view of the fact that the camp could not be reached 
after darkness had closed in. Our course had been around Cape North, 
and covering the territory between the coast and the base of Ran a Haua 
Kana. Loose bowlders of every imaginable shape and size cover the 
ground, threatening sprained limbs and broken bones at every incau- 
tious step, as though the expiring energy of the volcanoes had been ex- 
pended in creating this natural barrier. 

Camp Day, named in honor of our commanding officer, was located in 
a district known as Vai-mait-tai (good water), but it was decidedly a 
misnomer, the supply being ample, but brackish and ill-smelling. After 
a hearty meal of mutton, prepared by our guides in true island style, 
we sought shelter under the lee of an outcropping rock, fatigued enough 
to sleep through the attacks of myriads of noxious insects and regard- 
less of the passing showers of rain. 



TE TITO TE 1IKMA. OE EASTER ISLAND. 489 

ANAKENA BAY. 

December 23. — A dip' in the sea at daylight, and a breakfast of mut- 
ton which had been slowly roasting all night on hot stones placed in 
the ground and covered with earth to prevent the escape of heat, put 
us in prime condition for the work in hand. Our route lay along the 
north coast of the island and around Anakena Bay, the place where 
Hotu-Matua and his followers landed when they arrived from the un- 
known and much-disputed locality from which they migrated. On the 
sand beach of this bay we found the small univalve, the remains of which 
were noticed in all the caves and ruins on the island and which are still 
highly esteemed by the natives as an article of food. Jelly-fish, such as 
are known to the sailors as "Portuguese men-of-war," also abound, and 
are esteemed a delicacy by the natives. The entire plain back of An- 
akena (La Perouse) Bay is covered with small platforms, cairns, tombs, 
and the ruins of dwellings of various sorts. Houses built of loose stones, 
nearly circular in shape, are plentiful ; but they belong to a comparatively 
recent date, as is indicated by the fact that the stones, of which they 
are constructed, have been taken from the platforms and from the foun- 
dations of the thatched tents. Any sort of material that came handy 
appears to have been freely used by the builders of these houses. In 
several we found well-cut heads that had formerly ornamented image 
platforms, built in the walls, some facing inside and others in the op- 
posite direction. The ruins in the vicinity show that this had been the 
site of a large settlement, and that it continued to be a place of impor- 
tance through many generations; but the greatest mystery is how such 
a number of people obtained a sufficient supply of fresh water. 

Near Anakena is a large image in the best state of preservation of 
any found about the platforms of the island. The traditions assert that 
this was intended to represent a female, and that it was the last image 
completed and set up in place. Our guides informed us that it was 
only thrown down about twenty-four years ago, and previous to that 
time it had remained for many years the only statue standing upon a 
platform on the island. Camp Whitney was located at Hangaone Bay, 
where we found shelter in a bug-infested cave. The water supply was 
obtained from an ancient tomb near by, and was both scant in quantity 
and nasty in quality. We were, however, in such an indifferent state of 
mind that anything wet was acceptable. 

December 24. — With the knowledge that we had a particularly hard 
march before us, we struck cam]) early and got underway before it was 
fairly light in the morning. Around Tape Pokokoria the rugged nat- 
ure of the ground passed over was extremely exhausting. The slopes 
of Mount Puakalika are in places covered with coarse hummock-grass 
and flowering vines, which look green and attractive during the rainy 
season of the year, but which were at this time almost :is dry and parched 
as though scorched by fire. The toilsome march of this day was height- 
ened by the absence of water, and all suffered severely from thirst. 



490 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Starting' out in the morning - with empty canteens, our throats soon be- 
came dry and painful. A small quantity of water was found in the 
afternoon in Mount Puakalika crater, thick and unpleasant to look 
upon, but affording valuable relief to oar sufferings. 

THE POIKE PLAINS. 

The Poike Plains are extensive tracts of fine red volcanic sand and 
dust with occasional patches of hummock-grass struggling for exist- 
ence in this barren waste. Manga Tea-tea (White Mountains), so called 
from the grayish appearance of the rocks, furnished the stone imple- 
ments of the natives. The material was chipped as nearly as possible 
into the desired shape and then ground down to a point or edge by 
friction upon a hard surface with sand and water. At Anakena and 
other points convenient to the sand beach we found grinding-stones, 
together with unfinished and broken implements. 

The traditions assert that the island was in former ages densely pop- 
ulated, and the legends are supported by the gigantic works of the 
image and platform builders and the ruins of various sorts scattered 
about. While the accounts are probably greatly exaggerated in regard 
to the number of inhabitants at one time, there is every reason to be- 
lieve that the people were numerous enough to severely tax for their 
support the limited area of ground available for cultivation. The Incas 
of Peru usually selected for burial-places the rocky and steep slopes of 
the hills or the low sandy plains, where cultivation was impossible, and 
presuming that a similar economy might have been practiced here, 
much time was devoted to a thorough examination of the sand-wastes 
at the eastern extremity of the island. Excavations were made at the 
expense of great labor in several places where the indications were 
most promising, but with barren results. Digging to a depth of 9 feet 
in a depression near Cape Anataavanui we found several flat stones of 
large size, such as were used for facing the platforms, but the loose, 
shifting nature of the sand made it impossible with our small force to 
thoroughly investigate them. The trade-winds freely sweep these ele- 
vated plains, blowing the sand about, and creating ridges that may be 
leveled again by stronger currents at some other season. Hills and 
depressions simply represent the force and direction of the wind at the 
time. 

TONGARIKI. 

Camp Baird was delightfully located in a commodious cave called 
Ana Havea, on the bay of Hauga jSTui, near Point Onetea, and its 
proximity to Bana Eoraka where all the monoliths on the island had 
been quarried. Tongariki with its rich remains of platforms, images, 
cairns, and tombs, and Vailm and other points not yet explored, were 
sufficient to induce a permanent establishment during the remainder of 
our stay at Easter Island. The cave was dry, with spacious entrance 
exposed to the full force of the trade- winds, and we were comfortable 
to a degree, after dried grass and bulrushes had been collected to 



TK PITO TE HENUA, OK I. 1). 4' 

sleep upon. Successive generations of natives probably occupied this 
ancient cavern; an extensive corral has beeu built near by, and Messrs. 
Salmon and Brander sleep here while rounding up their earth'. Drink- 
ing-water, the great desideratum on the island, obtained from sources 
that form the crater of liana Roraka, was, owing to its animal and 
vegetable impurities, unpalatable, while the supply from the springs 
was more so, but afforded a pleasing variety, which enabled us to 
exercise a preference for some other, whenever either kind was used. 
The so-called springs are holes into which the sea-water percolates, 
and aie as .sail as the ocean, at high tide, and decidedly brackish at all 
other stages. 

December 25. — The forenoon was devoted to the exploration of the 
face of the bluff to the eastward of Tama Point. Many caves were 
reached after difficult and dangerous climbing, and were found to con- 
tain nothing of interest, while others of traditional importance were in- 
accessible from below, and we were not provided with ropes and the 
necessary appliances for reaching them from above. Xo doubt there 
are caves in this vicinity with contracted entrances that have been 
covered by loose rocks and intentionally concealed. One such cavern 
was found by accident. It contained a small image about 3 fee: high, 
carved out of hard gray rock. It was a splendid specimen of the work 
and could be easily removed to the boat-landing at Tongariki. lietrae- 
ing our steps toward the camp, the ground between Puakalika eleva- 
tion and liana Roraka was thoroughly examined dining the afternoon. 
The plain is completely covered with cairns, tombs, and platforms. 
Many of the most promising were completely demolished and the 
foundations dug up to a depth of six feet. All contained human re- 
mains in various stages of decay, and the earth upon which they were 
built proved to be a rich loam tilled with sea-shells of minute size, free 
of stones, while outside of the foundation-walls the composition was 
composed of bowlders of all sizes with very little earth. Among the 
vast ruins are many fragments of images and crowns scattered about, 
and it is evident that platforms were erected and destroyed by suc- 
ceeding generations. The traditions assert, and appearances indicate, 
that this plain had from the earliest times been one of the most densely 
populated districts on the island. Only the remains of walls and cis- 
terns wert' found here. They were generally small, the largest being !> 
feet in diameter, 11 feel (hep, and surrounded by a sloping bank 
paved with small stones to facilitate the collection of rain-water. 

In honor of the day, work was Suspended earlier than usual, and we 
lirned to camp a couple of hours before sundown, but we found that 
oiii' Christmas cheer had been reduced to "hard-tack" and island mut- 
ton by the leger-de main of our native assistants, though ample stores 
had been provided for the entire expedition. With no indulgence iu 
indigestible Christmas Luxuries, we were enabled to retire to an audia 
turbed rest a' an earlier hour than would have been probable in a more 
Civilized land and with different surroundings. 



492 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, I88S. 



December 26. — Our native contingent deserted iu a body at daylight 
on the plea that their religious convictions would not permit them to 
work on Sunday. Remonstrances and arguments were in vain, and we 
had to permit them to depart after exacting a promise that they would 
return early the next morning. Luka, the chief guide, lingered a while 
to state that his family burial place was beneath the great platform of 
Tongariki, and that he had a decided aversion to having the skulls of 
his ancestors added to our collection. 

Sunday inspection and its attendant functions has through long cus- 
tom become second nature with the men who have been long in the serv- 
ice, and through the desire to thus mark the day, the most valuable 
of our geological specimens were lost. The boatswain's mate took ad- 
vantage of our temporary absence to clean up the cave and make it 
more presentable, and, in doing so, threw all the stones and "trash" into 
the sea. Nothing could be said, in view of the fact that it was done 
with the best possible intentions, but he was greatly chagrined to find 
that those same stones had been carried over many a weary mile to be 
lost now, when it was impossible to obtain duplicates or other specimens 
of some of the peculiar formations met with on the tirst days of the trip. 

RANA RORAKA. 

The day was devoted to the examination of the inside of the crater of 
Eana Roraka. The walls of the crater are very abrupt except on the 
west side, where the lava-flow escaped to the sea, and here the c;ittle 
and horses find easy access to the pool of water that has collected iu 
the bottom. High up on the southern side are the workshops of the 
image-builders, extending in irregular terraces quite to the top. Here 
we found images in all stages of incompletion (Fig. 10), from the rude

original rock and launched down the steep incline. The modus operandi

appears to have been to select a suitable roclc upon which the image 
was sketched in a reclining position. The upper surface having been 
carved into shape and entirely finished, the last work was to cut the 
back loose from the rock. This necessitated the exercise of great care 
to prevent the breaking off of exposed portions, and was accomplished 
by building piles of stones to sustain the weight while it was being un- 
dermined. 

Ninety-three statues in all, similar to those shown in Figs. 11 and 12, 
were counted inside the crater, and of these forty are standing up. com- 
pleted and ready to be transported to the platforms for which they were.

intended. They stand well down towards the bottom of the slope, and 
are more or less buried in the earth by the washings from above, as 
shown in Figs. 13 and 14. 

The work of lowering the huge images from the upper terraces to the 
bottom of the crater ;ni<i tlience over the wall and down into the plain 
below, was of great magnitude, and we are lost in wonder thai so much 
could be accomplished by rude savages ignorant of everything in the 
way of mechanical appliances. The, average weight of these statues 
would be something between LO and 12 tons, bul some are very large 

and would weigh over 40 tons. It i.s possible that a slide was made, 
upon which the Images were launched to the level ground below; 
a number of broken and damaged figures lie in a position to suggest 
that idea, bul from the bottom of the crater they were transported up 
and over the wall and thence over hill and dale to various points all 

over tin- island. Excavations were made at different points inside the

crater, but nothing - was found of interest beyond a few broken stone 
implements that had no doubt been used by the image-builders.

[mage Standing Inside the Crater of 

Rana Roraka. 



December 27. — We made an early start and visited the image-builders' 
workshops on the west side of Rana Roraka, which are much more ex- 
tensive than those on the inside of the crater. These workshops com-. 
mence well up on the side of the mountain and extend quite to the 
summit by irregular terraces. In places these terraces extend one 
above another with unfinished images upon each, and the configura- 
tion of the land is such as to preclude all idea of launching the statues 
by means of a slide. We were unable to arrive at any satisfactory 
conclusion as to how the immense statues on the upper tier of works 
could be moved to the plain below, passing over the underlying cavi- 
ties where similar works had been quarried. We know the natives had 
ropes made of hemp, two kinds of which are indigenous to the island, 
but it is difficult to conjecture how these heavy weights were handled 
without mechanital appliances. One hundred and titty-five images 
were counted upon this slope in various stages, including those stand- 
ing at the base of the mountain finished and complete, ready for removal

to the platforms. Many of the images in the workshops are of huge 
proportions, but the largest one on the island lies on one of tin 1 central 

terraces in an unfinished condition and measures 7<> feet in length, 1 U 
feel across the body : the head being 28^ feet long. Home of the stand- 
ing statues are in as perfect condition as the day they were finished. 

One (Fig. lo) is noticeable from the fact that the head is slightly 
turned to one side and is known as the " wry-neck," but whether it is 
the result of accident or design could not be determined.

Another excellent specimen (Fig. 16) ofthese remarkable figures stands 
near the last mentioned and shows tool-marks around the neck as 
though an effort had been made to cut the head off. The natives call 
this "hiara" and have a tradition to the effect that it belonged to a 
powerful elan who were finally defeated in war, and that their enemies 
had made an attempt to destroy the statue by cutting off the head. The 
story may be based only upon the mutilation, but the chances are that 
it is founded upon fact. 

Nothing of importance was found by digging about the images or in 
the workshops except broken stone implements which had been used by 
the builders. In one of the quarries we found the only trace of sculpt- 
ured figures in the vicinity. 

These emblems were carved upon a smooth rock over a half-finished 
image. 



496 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

December 28. — Shortly after daylight the entire force started making 
excavations under the foundations of the image-builders houses, the 
ruins of which extend towards Eana Eoraka from Tongariki Bay, on 
regular terraces. These peculiar ruins are to be found here in great 
numbers both inside and outside of the crater, but do not differ from 
those already described. A custom obtained among the islanders, sim- 
ilar to that practiced by the tribes of Alaska and other Indians of 
America, of burying something of interest or value beneath the door- 
posts of their dwellings. Usually it was a smooth beach pebble which 
was supposed to have some fetish qualities to bring good luck or ward 
off evil influences. 

One of the largest of these ruins has an extensively paved terrace in 
front. At a depth of about three feet below the surface ot the central 
door-way, w r e found a rough angular flinty stone with a rudely carved 
face upon it. A prominent ruin of the same description inside of the 
crater, and another near the workshop on the outside, yielded a hard 
stone upon which marks had been carved very similar to those on the 
rocks at Orongo. 

SKULLS SHOWING PECULIAR MARKS 

One of our guides produced from a hiding place three ancient skulls, 
described elsewhere, upon the top of which these same mystical figures 
had been cut. They were not shown until a reward had been promised, 
and the guide claimed to have obtained them in their present condi- 
tion from the King's platform. 

On the outside of the crater of Eana Eoraka, near the top and looking 
towards the southwest, we found a workshop containing fifteen small 
images. These had been overlooked in our former trips to this place. 

Scattered over the plains extending towards Vaihu are a large num- 
ber of images, all lying face downward. The indications are that 
they were being removed to their respective platforms when the work 
was suddenly arrested. These heavy weights were evidently moved 
by main strength, but why they were dragged over the ground face 
downward instead of upon their backs, thus protecting their features, 
is a mystery yet unsolved. One statue in a group of three is that of 
a female; the face and breast is covered with lichen, which at a short 
distance gives it the appearance of being whitewashed. 

December 29. — We continued the work of exploration from Vaihu 
around the southwxst points of the island. Excavations were made 
wherever the indications were good, but the results did not differ from 
those already described. Mount Orito was visited, from whence the 
obsidian was obtained for spear-heads, and also the quarries that pro- 
duce the red pigment from which the natives make a red paint by rub- 
bing it down with the juice of the sugar-cane. The remainder of the 
slay on Easter Island was devoted to the collection of traditions, trans- 
lations of tablets, and. similar matters of interest,.

TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 497 

LATFORMS AND IMAGES. 

la order to form an estimate of the magnitude of the work performed 
by the image-makers, every one on the island was carefully counted, and 
the list shows a total of five hundred and fifty- five images (Plates XXV 
and XXVI). Of this number forty are standing inside of the crater aud 
nearly as many more on the outside of Rami Boraka(Plate XXVII), at 
the foot of the slope where they were placed as finished and ready for 
removal to the different platforms for which they were designed; some 
finished statues lie scattered over the plains (Plate XXVIII) as though 
they were being dragged toward a particular locality but were suddenly 
abandoned. The large majority of the images, however, are lying near 
the platforms all around the coast, all more or less mutilated and some 
reduced to a mere shapeless fragment. Not one stands in its original 
position upon a platform. The largest image is in one of the work- 
shops in an unfinished state and measures 70 feet in length ; the small- 
est was found in one of the caves and is a little short of 3 feet in length. 
One of the largest images that has been in position lies near the plat- 
form which it ornamented, near Ovahe; it is 32 feet long and weighs 
50 tons. 

Images representing females were found. One at Anakena is called 
" Viri-viri Moai-a-Taka" and is apparently as perfect as the day it was 
finished; another, on the plain west of liana Roraka is called "Moai 
Pntu," and is in a fair state of preservation. The natives have names 
for every one of the images. The designation of images and platforms 
as obtained from the guides during the exploration was afterwards 
checked off in company with other individuals without confusion in the 
record. The coarse gray trachytic lava of which the images were made, 
is found only in the vicinity of Rana Roraka and was selected because 
the conglomerate character of the material made it easily worked with 
the rude stone implements that constituted the only tools possessed by 
the natives. The disintegration of the material when exposed to the 
action of the elements is about equivalent to that of sandstone under 
similar conditions, and admits of an estimate in regard to the proba- 
ble age. The traditions in regard to the images are numerous, but 
relate principally to impossible occurrences, such as being endowed 
with power to walk about in the darkness, assisting certain elans by 
subtle means in contests, and delivering oracular judgments. The 
legends state that a son of Kin- Mahuta Ariiki, named Tro Kaiho, 
designed the first image, but it is difficult t<> arrive at an estimation of 
the period. The journals of the early navigators throw but little light 
upon the subject. The workshops must have been in operation at the 
time of Captain Cook's visit, but unfortunately his exploration of the 
island was not directed towards I lie crater of Rana Roraka. 

Although the images range in size from the colossus of Til feet down 

to the pigmy of 3 feet, thej are clearly all of the same type and general

characteristics. The head is long, the eyes close under the heavy 
brows, the nose long, low-bridged, and expanded at the nostrils, the 
upper lip short and the lips pouting. The aspect is slightly upwards, 
and the expression is firm and profoundly solemn. Careful investiga- 
tion failed to detect the slightest evidence that the sockets had ever 
been fitted with artificial eyes, made of bone and obsidian, such as are 
placed in the wooden images. 

The head was in all cases cut flat on top to accommodate the red 
tufa crowns with which they were ornamented, but the images standing 
on the outside of the crater had flatter heads and bodies than those 
found around the coast. The images represent the human body only 
from the head to the hips, where it is cut squarely off to afford a good 
polygon of support when standing, The artists seem to have exhausted 
their talents in executing the features, very little work being done 
below the shoulders, and the arms being merely cut in low relief. The 
ears are only rectangular projections, but the lobes are represented 
longer in the older statues than in those of more recent date. 

The images were designed as effigies of distinguished persons and 
intended as monuments to perpetuate their memory. They were never 
regarded as idols, and were not venerated or worshiped in any manner. 
The natives had their tutelary genii, gods, and goddesses, but they were 
represented by small wooden or stone idols, which bore no relation to t he 
images that ornamented the burial platforms. The image-makers were a 
privileged class, and the profession descended from father to son. Some 
of the natives still claim a descent from the image-makers, and refer to 
their ancestors with as much pride as to the royal family. One of our 
guides never missed an opportunity of stating that one of his fore- 
fathers was Unrautahui, the distinguished image-maker. 

The work of carving the image into shape and detaching it from the 
rock of which it was a part, did not consume a great deal of time, but 
the chief difficulty was, in the absence of mechanical contrivances, to 
launch it safely down the slope of the mountain and transport it to a 
distant point. It was lowered to the plain by a system of chocks and 
wedges, and the rest was a dead drag accomplished by main strength. A 
roadway was constructed, over which the images w T ere dragged by means 
of ropes made of indigenous hemp, and sea- weed and grass made excellent 
lubricants. The platforms were all built with sloping terraces in the 
rear, and up this incline a temporary road-way was constructed of a 
suitable height, upon which the statue could be rolled until the base 
was over its proper resting-place. The earth was then dug away to 
allow the image to settle down into position, the ropes being used to 
steady it iu the mean time. It was a work of great magnitude, but we 
can clearly see how it was accomplished with a large force of able bodied 
men. 

The crowns, or head ornaments, were made of red vesicular tufa, quar- 
ried in the Teraai Hills, where many finished specimens are still standing.

Those truncated cones, nearly cylindrical in shape, were easily trans- 
ported. The material is readih quarried and fashioned, being light, 
only about 1.4 times heavier than water, while the average density of 
the image-stone is about 2.1. 

The largest crown measured was 12i feet in diameter, but of those 
that had actually been placed in position the average weight would not 
be more than 3 tons. The crowns were placed in position upon the 
heads of the standing images by building a road-way upon which they 
could be rolled to the proper spot. The clearing away of the incline 
was the final act. The earth which formed the surface was utilized as 
garden-patches, and the stones which formed the foundation of the road- 
way were disposed of in building the wing-extensions of the platform. 
The platforms differ greatly in dimensions, but the general plan and 
characteristics are invariably the same. Many of them are in a fair 
state of preservation, except that the images have been thrown down 
and the terraces in the rear obliterated or strewn with rubbish, while 
others have been reduced to a state of complete ruin. The platforms 
are usually located near the beach, and on the high bluff some of them 
are quite near the o^^^ overlooking the sea. The general plan consists 
of a front elevation composed of blocks of stone fairly well squared 
and neatly lifted together without cement, a parallel wall forming the 
inside boundary, built of uncut stone, inclosing small chambers or 
tombs placed at irregular intervals. Loose bowlders fill the spaces 
between the tombs and form the horizontal plane of the platform, into 
which are let the rectangular stones which constituted the base upon 
which the images stood. The facade stones are large and heavy, and in 
some eases the smooth surface presented could not well be attributed 
to the rude implements at the command of the builders, and must have 
been produced by friction or grinding. Long wings composed of uncut 
stone extend from the platform proper, built up to the summit at the 
line of junction and sloping away to the surface of the ground at the 
ends. In the rear of the platform a few steps descend to a gently 
sloping terrace, which terminates in a low wall and is bounded by a 
squarely built wall raised above the ground so as to join the top of the 
platform. Unman remains till the inner chambers', and bones lie scat- 
tered about among the loose bowlders of t he platform and its extensions. 
The ruined condition of these solid specimens of architecture, with the 
overthrown images and immense deposit of loose bowlders on the 
surface of the ground, are strongly suggestive of earthquakes and 
volcanic eruption. The images in all stages of incompletion in the 
workshops, and abandoned en route to the coast in various directions, 
indicate that the work was suddenly arrested, and not gradually brought 

to an end ; but the t rail it ions are silent upon the subject, and no record 

has been handed down of the disturbance of any of the volcanoes on 
the island.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



Platform No. 1. — Known to the natives as " Hanga Roa". Only the 
base remains, measuring 59 feet long by 7 feet wide. This pile was 
demolished to obtain material for the construction of a house for one of 
the Catholic missionaries formerly stationed on the island. 

Platform No. 2. — Called "Ana Koiroraroa"; ICO feet long by 12£ feet 
wide and 10 feet high. The facing-stones on thefront line remain intact, 
but the body of the platform is a mere mass of loose stones, probably 
torn up by the natives in recent years for the purpose of depositing 
their dead in these ancient structures. The three statues that formerly 
adorned this pile are lying immediately in the rear, and show from 
their positions that they had faced inboard, with their backs to the 
sea. These images are much weather-worn and defaced : one is entire; 
another has the head lying close by, probably broken off in the fall ; 
and the third is minus the head and with the neck showing saw-marks. 
We afterwards found out that a French vessel of war visited the island 
a few years ago and the head of this image was cut off by them and 
taken to Europe. 

Platform No. 3 (See Fig. 17). — Called " Hanga Varevare"; 50 feet 
long and 8 feet wide. This has the appearance of an unfinished pile 
and is merely a burial place covered with loose rocks and without the 
usual smoothly faced stones in front. We found the catacombs or 
tombs underneath this platform had been robbed of the most ancient 
skulls, and concluded that the Frenchmen had taken everything of 
iuterest away.

Platform No. 4.— Called "Tahai"; 100 feet long, 7£ feet wide, and 7 
feet high. In a bad state of preservation, but the facing-stones on the 
front are sufficiently plain, while the rest of the pile is a mass of loose

stones. Five largo flat stones at regular intervals along the platform, 
show where the images once stood. The statues have fallen face down- 
ward on the inshore side, and are much broken and dilapidated. The 
one on the north end is of gigantic size, and much larger than the 
others. The red tufa crown that adorned this image lies near it, and 
measures 7 feet 9 inches wide; 5 feet 9 inches in ellipse; and 4 feet 9 
inches high, and the top is ornamented by sculptured lines that have 
the appearance of geometrical figures, but are too much obliterated to 
decipher. 

Platform No. 5.— Called by the same name as the last, only a few yards 
distant, is shaped like a right angle, and it is possible that these two 
platforms may have been originally designed for one of huge propor- 
tions. The stones of which it is composed have been thrown about in 
such disorder that the original design can not be followed, but the Hat 
base stones indicate where the images once stood. At one end of this 
platform a statue 14 feet high and 9 feet across the hips, lies face 
downward on the inboard side, and at the other end, one measuring 
15 feet long and (i i't'vt wide, lies face downward toward the sea, being 
one of the few images on the island found in that position, admitting 
the possibility of having faced outboard. 

Platform No. G.— Called " Anotai"; 120 feet long, 17.4 feet wide, and Ik 
feet high. In a bad state of preservation, though the faced stones on the 
front may lie traced. The remains of one image lies on the inboard side, 
but minus the head. A large cavity in the center of the back of this 
image attracted attention, but could not be explaiued. The red tufa 
crown belonging to this statue lies half-buried in the earth, about 100 
feet distant. Under the center of this platform were obtained some in- 
teresting relies, and the tombs bore evidence of great antiquity. 

Platform No. 7. — Called "Ahuakapu"; 101 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 
8 feet high. In a bad state of preservation. Three images lying on the 
front side with the appearance of having been pulled over backwards, 
and one upon the inshore side down upon its face. All four statues 
are in good condition, except that the heads have been broken oil' at the 
neck by the fall. One of these detached heads measured ."> feet 3 inches 
in length by ."> feel 2 inches from ear to ear. The four pedestal stones 
are still in place on the platform and average 4 feet long and ."> feet 8 
inches wide, and are composed of hard volcanic rock, roughly squared. 

Platform No. 8. — Called "Anaoraka"; 95 feet long and s feel wide 
and 7 feet high. Remarkable for the huge stones that support the sea 
face, the largest of which measures 6 feet 9 inches high and I feet 7 
inches wide. Four images have fallen upon their faces upon the in- 
board side. Only a pedestal stone remains in position, which is 5 feet 
2 inches square by 2 feet 2 inches thick. (Fig. L8). 

Platform No. &— Called "Kikikihiraumea"; L86 feci long, 8 feet 10 
inches wide, and 7 fret 5 inches thick. The central section of tins struct- 
ure contains stones so remarkably well cut and fitted ogether that it

merits the accompanying sketch. Four images were found, which had 
been thrown down on their faces on the inboard side. These are in a 
fair state of preservation. From this ruin we obtained skulls, obsidian 
spear-beads, and stone tools.

an exceedingly fine platform, and contains some remarkably large stones. 
In the face of the main structure are huge blocks of igneous rock that 
appear to have once been fashioned into faces and figures, but now so 
destroyed by the action of the elements aud perhaps by the hand of the 
iconoclast that the features can only be dimly traced. Hard work with

our entire force disclosed beneath this platform well constructed cata- 
combs and tombs, containing human remains so old thai they crumbled 
into dust upou exposure to the air. The removal of one <>f the facing- 
stones revealed a lot of skulls with remarkably broad, heavy underjaws. 
These were generally too brittle to be handled, and a peculiar feature 
about the hud was the fact that these heads had been entombed to- 
gether, ami the surroundings excluded the idea of any other portions of 
the bodies haviug been interred with them. Only one image is in 
sight, and the proximity of the platform to the edge of the bluff sug- 
gests the possibility that other statues may have been thrown into 
the sea. From the size and character of the work on the structure it 
is not reasonable to suppose that it was designed to support the one 
insignificant statue that lies near it. 

Platform Ko. 12.— Called "Ohau". Central section 18 feet long, 9 
feet wide, and G feet high. One image thrown down upon its face on 
the inboard side, 8 feet 4 inches long: extreme width of body 5 feet ; 
length of head 4 feet ; and width from ear to ear, 3 feet 3 inches. Cood 
state of preservation. (Plate XXIX). 

Platform No. 13. — Called "Ahukinokino". In such a state of ruin 
that measurements were not obtainable. Situated close to the edge of 
the high cliff. 

Platform No. 14. — Called "Ahutoretore ". Has been so completely 
destroyed that nothing can be determined about its original size and 
importance. Excavations in this vicinity produced nothing but a ir\\ 
stray spear heads of obsidian. 

Platform X<>. 15.— Called "Hangatariri"; 103 feet long, 11 feet wide: 
and 6 feet high. In very bad condition, but some of the large cut facing- 
stones are in position. Four images lie (ace downward on the island 
side, and two more have fallen on their backs toward the sea. A few 
yards back of this structure is a tomb 50 feet long and C> feet wide, built 
of stones taken from the platform and those peculiarly (ait stones that 
form the foundations of the image-builders' houses. At one end is a 
hard stone slab that appears to have been covered with hieroglyphics, 
but they are too nearly obliterated to be accurately traced. After a 
thorough investigation we concluded that it was of comparatively 
recent date and had no distinctive features of its own. On the plain, a 
few hundred yards distant, is an image of gigantic proportions lying 
upon its face with the head toward the sea. The indications are that 
it was designed for this platform and was being moved into position 
when from some sudden emergency it had to be abandoned. The 
ground underneath the statue has been dug out by later generations 

in such a manner that the body of the image forms the roof of the 
<-ave. The base of the statue shows traces of rudely sculptured figlll i 
Dearly obliterated. In this vicinity are several large caves, with tin- 
narrow entrances completely blocked up with loose stones, which wen- 
not investigated for the want of time. 



504 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Platform No. 16. — Called u Haugaoteo" ; 70 feet long and 12 feet wide. 
Has the appearance of having been in process of construction when 
the work was suddenly suspended. 

Platform No. 17. — Called "Tumuheipara" ; 40 feet long, 8 feet wide, 
and 8 feet high. This structure also appears to have been abandoned 
before completion. The chances are that several days could have been 
spent upon the extensive plain, back of these images, to great advan- 
tage and it is regretted that the limited time at our disposal did not 
allow a more thorough investigation. 

Platform No. 18.— Called " Haahuroa". Central section 40 feet long, 
12 feet wide, and 7 feet high, with wings 145 feet in length. One image 
lying on the inboard side measures 7 feet 5 inches long and 3 feet 5 
inches wide; length of head to shoulders 3 feet 4 inches, and width 
from ear to ear 3 feet o inches. The fragments of two other images lie 
in front of the platform. The huge facing-stones of this structure have 
been thrown about as though by some great convulsion of nature, and 
some of them bear evidences of having been ornamented with sculpt- 
ured figures. 

Platform No. 19. — Called a Akaue". Seems to have been abandoned 
while in the process of construction. A few faced stones intended for 
the front of the central section are lying about, but were never placed 
in position. 

Platform No. 20. — Called " Ahuroa". Is a mere mass of loose rocks, 
said to have been destroyed in the tribal wars, but it has the appear- 
ance of having never been completed. 

Platform No. 21. — Called " Vaiavangarenga". In the same condition 
as the last. No images. 

Platform No. 22. — Called " Maiki". Same as the last; merely a pile 
of loose stones covering human remains. These platforms may have 
been robbed to supply the material for the construction of the numerous 
houses and cairns, the ruins of which cover the hills in this vicinity. 

Platform No. 23.— Called " Tajika". Central section 38 feet long, 48 
feet wide, and 12 feet high, the extreme length wilh wings 120 feet. In 
very bad condition. One small image lies face-upward toward the sea, 
much broken. Facing and other suitable stones have been removed 
from this platform for the construction of tombs and houses. Near at 
hand is one of those peculiar ways, made by paving the sloping bank 
with regular lines of smooth, round bowlders, as though intended for 
hauling up heavy boats or weights, 

Platform No. 24. — Called "Punamuta". In its incipient stage, and 
important only from, the fact that it shows the manner of laying the 
foundation of the work. 

Platform No. 25. — Called " Koteva". This has been an important 
structure and was built in the shape of a right angle 60 feet long, 11 
feet wide, and 20 feet high. Portions of the walls have been thrown 
down, aud no images could be found. 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER [SLAND. 50,5 

Platform No. 26. — Called "Tetonga". Similar in shape and structure 
to the last, but of smaller size. From these piles we obtained relics in 
the shape of obsidian spearheads, stone implements, ami skulls. 

Platform No. 27.— Called "Hanghaogio"; 150 feet long, 8 feet wide, 
and 10 feet high. Three small images have been thrown down and 
much broken. 

Platform No.28. — ('ailed "Huarero". Very similar to the last, but 
located on the hill-side about three-quarters of a mile back of the bay. 
The facing-stones show traces of carving, but so nearly obliterated that 
only these figures could be made out : Qy cp, and they seemed to lie 
often repeated. The fragments of two images lie behind the platform. 

Platform No. 20. — Called " Anakena"; 75 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 
10 feet high. An image li°s upon its face upon the inboard side, 13 
feet long and 9 feet across the hips; length of head, to shoulders, 5 
feet, and width, from ear to ear, G feet 6 inches. This image is in the 
best state of preservation of any found about the platforms of the 
island. The traditions state that it was the last statue finished and 
sit up in place. Our guides maintained that this is the statue of a 
female, and that it was only thrown down about twenty-four years ago. 
Its size, and proximity to the perfectly smooth landing place at Ana- 
kena Bay, would insure its easy removal to a vessel. From the sand 
beach at Anakena Bay we passed over hills composed of volcanic cin- 
der as light as coke, but very hard. Beyond this are numerous ruins 
of houses, each with a small stone building connected that was evi- 
dently designed for fowls. The largest of these was about 8 feet square, 
and the only opening was a small hole lor the chickens to pass 
through. 

Platform No. 30. — Called " Ahutrature". Central section 30 feet long, 
10 feet wide, and G feet high. Extreme length 80 feet. In ruins, with no 
images. 

Platform No. 31.— Called "Anateka"; 30 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 
7 feet high. Extreme length 100 feet. In a very bad condition. 
Small fragments are all that remain of two images and two crowns. 

Platform No. 32. — Called " Ahupuapuatetea". Merely a shapeless 
mass of uncut stones remain to indicate the site of the structure. 

Platform No. 33.— Called " Ahangakihikihi »; 20 feet long, 10 feel 
wide, and 9 feet high. In ruins. One small image lies on the inboard 
side in a bad condition. 

Platform No. 34.— Called "Punahoa". Although in ruins, this has 
evidently been a structure of some importance; 175 feet long, 8 feet 
wide, with the central section projecting feet forward of t lie main 
line. The facing-stones are from G feel to 9 feet in length by 5 feet and 
1 foot in thickness. An image lies upon its face on the inboard side,

nearly spherical in shape and about 8 feet 4 inches in circumference. 
The natives called it " Petakula". and we could only make out that it 
was ;i grinding stone of some sort. 

Platform No. 35.— Called " Puapau" ; 150 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 
8 feet high, with a small platform in front of it. The building of this 
elaborate structure must have furnished employment for a large num- 
ber of people. The foundation stones are of hard rock of immense size, 
all smoothly faced. Four images have been thrown down, two on each 
side, and all much broken. 

Platform No. 30. — Called " Hangakouri "\ Central section 70 feet long, 
7 feet wide, and 8 feet high. Extreme length 300 feet. In a state of 
absolute ruin and no images. 

Platform No. 37. — Called " Hangahohoouu ". Completely in ruins and 
with one image in a bad condition. Between these last two platforms 
is a paved way leading to a small channel through the rocks that 
affords a safe and convenient landing for small boats. 

Platform No. 38.— Called " Mari". Central section 80 feet long, 12 feet 
wide, and 7 feet high. Extreme length 300 feet, situated very close to 
edge of the bluff. 

Platform No. 39. — Called " Ahurai". Very large; but, like the last, in 
a state of ruin. 

Platform No. 40. — Called "Tehahitunukiolaira". Of great size; but, 
like the last, in a state of absolute ruin; covering human remains. 

Platform No. 41. — Called " Naruaanga". Small and inferior ; also in 
rm'ns.and no images. 

Platform No. 42. — Called "• Hangaopuna" ; 100 feet long and 10 feet 
wide. Has two layers of roughly cut stones in the front face, and ap- 
pears to have been left in an unfinished state. 

Platform No. 43. — Called " Tumatuma"; 25 feet long, 7 feet wide, and 
7 feet high. Poorly constructed, and contains nothing of interest but 
one small image. 

Platform No. 44, — Called "Tokaie". Larger than the last, but in a 
bad condition. A much battered head lies just behind the pile, but the 
rest of the image can not be found. 

Platform No. 45. — Called " Yaitnangeo"; 50 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 
15 feet high. Extreme length, including wings, 150 feet. In a state of 
ruin, and has one large image thrown down on the inboard side. 

Platform No. 46.— Called "Moukuhoi"; 20 feet long, 7 feet wide, and 
5 feet high. Extreme length, including wings, 60 feet. Situated very 
close to the edge of the bluff, and looks as if the destroyers of the struct- 
ure might have tossed the most of it into the sea. 

Platform No. 17. — Called " Moukuroa". In all respects a duplicate of 
the last one. 

Platform No. 48. — Called " Motuariki"; 20 feet long, 7 feet wide, and 5 
feet high. Extreme length, including wings, 260 feet. This has been a 
large and imposing structure. The central section, upon which theiin-

age stood projects beyond the line of the platform, and was higher. In 
the rear, and extending the eutire length of the pile, is a broad terrace, 
neatly paved with smooth round bowlders. The fragments of three im- 
ages lie upon the terrace. 

Platform No. 49. — Called " Oneonepuhea ". Centralsection is about 
15 feel long by 6 feet high. This is a crescenl shaped structure, and the 
only one of the kind that we saw on the island. It is situated on the 
extreme edge of the cliff, which at this point has a straight away fall of 
over 500 feel to the sea, which dashes against its wall like base. There 
is no image in sight, but a large pedestal stone, inclined at a sharp angle 
towards the sea, shows where one has stood and suggests what became 
of it. 

Platform X<>. 50. — Called "Ahutakaure". Located on Poike cliff, 
facing westward; is small and unimportant ami in a state of complete 
rain. On the east slope of the mountain we found an image, the head 
of which had been broken off, but it lies near by. There is no platform 
here and no indications that one was intended to be built in the vicinity; 
so we concluded that the statue was being moved to some distant locality 
when it was broken and abandoned. 

Platform Xo. 51 . — Called " Hangaiti " ; 30 feet long and 8 feet wide and 
•1 feet high. In a bad condition and one small image broken. 

Platform Xo. 52. — Called "Tongariki"; 150 feet long, feet wide, and 
S feet high (Plates XXX-XXX1V). Extreme length, including orig- 
inal wings, 510 feet. This is the largest platform on the island, and 
was ornamented with fifteen gigantic statues. These have been thrown 
down upon their faces on the inshore side, and the most of these are 
broken, the one on the south end being fractured across the middle of 
the body, leaving the lower section still standing. The red tufa crowns 
are lying a short distance away and are also much broken. The hard 
stones of winch the sea front of this platform is constructed are of im- 
mense size, faced and neatly joined together. One of the foundation- 
stones in the center of this wall is of red tufa and represents a human 
head. 

Our investigations were commenced at this point by throwing down 
the facing-stones and working straight backwards through the plat- 
form. The labor was great, and occupied the most of our force for nearly 
two days, but the catacombs and tombs underlying the structure were 
thoroughly examined. Under theeentral section are small, narrow pas- 
sages forming a part of the original design, having been built up while 
the platform was in process of construction, and containing human re- 
mains. The oiliest of these tombs appear to have been sealed up before 
the structure was completed, and the probability is that they were not 
intended to be opened, from the fact that there is nothing to indicate 
their exact locality. The pedestal-stones, all of which are still in place, 
show that the images were put up at equal distances and with a view 
to symmetry, and without regard to the position of the tombs; though 



508 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

it is pretty well established that they were intended as effigies of chiefs 
or distinguished persons. The terrace behind the platform was also 
used as a burial-place, and contained remains of an ancient date. Suc- 
ceeding generations have utilized the same places for the same purposes, 
but there are passages under the platform that have never been opened 
since the structure was built. The entire plain back of Tongariki Bay 
is one vast cemetery, containing the decaying remains of thousands of 
people. Every pile of stones, cave or ruined platform, house or cairn", 
has been used as a tomb. The christianized natives of today still re- 
gard this as a favorite burial-place. They have neither the ambition nor 
the industry to construct tombs for themselves, but are content to place 
their dead in receptacles filled with the remains of their ancestors. The 
recess-angles between the bodies of the fallen images, and the platforms 
upon which the base rests, are filled with remains of a recent date. 

Platform No. 53. — Called "One-tea". Completely in ruins. Three 
images much broken. Foundation proper about 100 feet long.

long, 7 feet wide, and 7 feet high. Extreme length 250 feet. Only 
two images remain, but appearances indicate that others have been 
destroyed. Upon terraces sloping towards the sea from the front are 
numerous remains of image-builders' houses. From the back of the 
structure a nicely paved way, 10 feet wide, extends inland for a dis- 
tance of 200 yards. 

Platform No. 59. — Called " Hanga-mahihiku ". A mere mass of ruins, 
and almost devoid of shape. No images.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



Thirteen colossal images that once ornamented this remarkable struc- 
ture have been thrown down and more or less damaged. Their red 
tufa crowns, also considerably broken, lie near at hand. On tbe in- 
land facing-wall there is a ground tier of gray volcanic stone finely 
dressed, and on this is a tier of tufa stones 4i feet long, 2i feet high, 
and S inches thick each, and these are covered with hieroglyphics. 
This is known as the King's platform, and is regarded as one of the 
most important on the island, on account of the finished work on the 
structure as well as the numerous sculptures (Fig. 19). The tradition

asserts that this was the burial place of Hotu-Matua, the first king, 
and a long line of his descendants. Our excavations in the vicinity 
produced nothing of interest beyond a few ancient skulls with lower 
jaws of extraordinary size and width. From the foundation of image- 
builders' houses we obtained fine stone implements and carving tools. 

Platform No. 81. — Called " Harerora". Small and unimportant. One 
image, much broken. 

Platform No. 82.— Called "Motuopope". Central section 252 feet 
long, 10 feet wide, and 7 feet high. Extreme length, 375 feet. Six im- 
ages in rather bad condition. This structure is important from the fact 
that the statues have short ears, the only ones of the kind we found on 
the island. The sketches will show that on all the platforms, as well 
the images in the workshops as those left in an unfinished state were 
all carved with long ears. Why there was an exception made to the 
general rule in the images that adorned this structure, could not be 
determined. 

Platform No. 83. — Called "Anaonero". Consisting of foundation 
stones only, showing that the work was abandoned shortly after being 
commenced.

ished and shows fragments of two large images.

Platform No. 107. — Called "Ahumeamea". Small and irregular con- 
struction. One image much damaged. 

Platform No. 108. — Called "Ahumata-iti". This structure has been 
pretty thoroughly demolished and shows the fragments of one image. 

Platform No. 100. — Called '-Tallin". The dimensions of the structure 
are not great, but ii is remarkable on account of the finished workman- 
ship. The sea front is built of immense blocks of hard heavy volcanic 
rock, smoothly faced and neatly joined together. In places, small stones 
have been mortised into the larger ones. It is surprising that such 
results could be produced, by t he rude stone implements that are known 
to have been the only tools at the command of the natives. Finished 
surfaces might be the result of .minding with sand and water, but the 
joints and fittings could onh be accomplished by long and patient 
labor. Some of the facing-stones were estimated at a weight of up- 
wards of 5 tons. Under the impression thai the superior character 
of the work indicated a platform of more than usual importance, it was 
thoroughly investigated at the expense of great labor and time. A 
section of the front wal] was thrown down and the stones removed 



512 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889, 

until an opening was made clear through the structure. No results 
having been obtained except a knowledge of how the pile was con- 
structed from the foundation up, additional efforts were directed 
towards the two ends. To our great disappointment, we had nothing 
to show for the great labor expended upon this platform. The only 
human remains about the place are those of recent date, in shallow 
tombs on the rear side of the pile. There is a tradition to the effect 
that this was the last platform built on the island and was intended 
for the colossal image (70 feet) lying in the workshops on the west 
side of the crater of Ran a Koraka. The legend asserts that when the 
work upon the platform aud images had arrived at a certain stage, a 
great feast was held in honor of the event by the powerful tribe of 
Viuapu. The wife of the chief was of the Tongariki clan and during the 
ceremonies this "lady" was slighted in the division of "long pig," but 
whether intentionally or otherwise does not appear. Cannibalism was 
practiced on the island down to the advent of the first missionaries, and 
was always an important feature of the ancient feasts. The bodies 
were roasted in ovens made of hot stones covered with earth, after the 
manner practiced all through Polynesia, and certain portions were 
awarded to prominent individuals. Upon this particular occasion the 
rib-roast, " tenderloin" steak, or whatever the favorite morsel was which 
belonged to the aforesaid female by reason of her rank, was given to 
another. The insulted individual immediately sought the protection 
of her own clan, who arose en masse to vindicate the Tongariki honor. 
Long and bloody wars followed. Image-builders and platform-makers 
were drawn into the conflict from all parts of the island and, in a spirit 
of revenge, platforms were destroyed aud images thrown down when- 
ever opportunity offered. This is believed to have been the origin of 
the trouble which has laid waste the extraordinary works of this island.

diameter and circular in shape. This is believed to have been the 
theater of the native ceremonies, and perhaps the spot where the feasts 
were held. We made excavations in the center and around the sides, 
but without a " find." 

Platform No. 111. — ('ailed "Ahutupai." lias been pretty thoroughly 
demolished. Six images in a bad condition lie on the top of the pile. 

Platform No. 112. — Called "Ahnrikiriki." Situated on the extreme 
southwestern end of the island, and remarkable from its position on the 
face of a perpendicular cliff nearly 1,000 feet high and midway between 
the sea and the top. Sixteen small images are lying on this platform 
and many of them seem to be in excellent condition. We could find no 
way of reaching the narrow ledge upon which this platform stands. No 
road leads down from the top; it can not be approached from either side, 
and from below it is a straight up and down wall against which the sea 
dashes continually. It is hardly probable that the images were lowered 
from the top by ropes, and the natural conclusion is, that a roadway 
once existed, which has been undermined by the waves and has fallen 
into the sea. 

Platform No. 113. — Called "Kaokaoe." This was originally a large 
structure, but has been completely demolished by Mr. Brander to obtain 
material for the construction of stone-fences about his place. 

LANGUAGE. 

The principal feature of interest, connected with Easter Island, is the 
written language by which the ancient traditions and legends were per- 
petuated. The existence of the incised tablets was not known until the 
missionaries settled upon the island. Numerous specimens were found 
in the possession of the natives, but no especial attention appears to 
have been directed towards them. Several persons, belonging to vessels 
that were wrecked at Easter Island, report having seen these tablets, but 
they were so highly prized by the natives, that they could not be induced 
to part with them. The three hundred islanders who emigrated to 
Tahiti had in their possession a number of these tablets ; they created 
some attention on account of the remarkable skill with which the figures 
were executed, but they were highly prized by the owners and no effort 
was made to secure them because their real value was not discovered. 
The Chilian corvette ()" Him/ins visited Easter Island in January, 1870, 
and Captain Cana secured three tablets, t wo of which are on deposit in 
the national museum at Santiago de Chili and the third was sent to 
France, but does not appeared to have reached its destination. Paper 
impressions and casts were taken from the Chilian tablets for the 
various museums of Europe. Those sent to the English Ethnological 
Society created some interest after a time, bill others sent to Berlin 
were regarded as stamps for marking native cloth (Mit theilungen, duly, 
1ST 1 ). Seven of these tablets are now in the possession of Tepano 
Jansser, bishop of Axieri, all in excellent state of preservation. 

il. Mis. 224, pt. 2 ;;.; 



514 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

While the Mohican was at Tahiti, the bishop kindly permitted us to 
examine these tablets and take photographs of them. These tablets 
were obtained from the missionaries who had been stationed on Easter 
Island, and they ranged in size from 5h inches in length by 4 inches 
broad, to 5£ feet in length and 7 inches wide. Diligent search was 
made for specimens of these tablets during our visit to Easter Island. 
At first the natives denied having any, but Mr. Salmon knew of the 
existence of two, and these were finally purchased after a great deal of 
trouble and at considerable expense. The tablets obtained are in a fair 
state of preservation. The large one is a piece of drift-wood that from 
its peculiar shape is supposed to have been used as a portion of a canoe. 
The other is made of the toromiro wood indigenous to the island. In 
explanation of the disappearance of these tablets, the natives stated 
that the missionaries had ordered all that could be found to be burned, 
with a view to destroying the ancient records, and getting rid of every- 
thing that would have a tendency to attach them to their heathenism, 
and prevent tlieir thorough conversion to Christianity. The loss to the 
science of philology Irv this destruction of valuable relics is too great 
to be estimated. The native traditions in regard to the incised tablets 
simply assert that Hotu-Matua, the first king, possessed the knowledge 
of this written language, and brought with him to the island sixty-seven 
tablets containing allegories, traditions, genealogical tables, and proverbs 
relating to the land from which he had migrated. A knowledge of the 
written characters was confined to the royal family, the chiefs of the 
six districts into whicli the island was divided, sous of those chiefs, and 
certain priests or teachers, but the people were assembled at Anekena 
Bay once each year to hear all of the tablets read. The feast of the 
tablets was regarded as their most important fete day, and not even war 
was allowed to interfere with it. 

The combination of circumstances that caused the sudden arrest of 
image-making, and resulted in the abandonment of all such work On the 
island, never to be again revived, may have had its effect upon the art 
of writing. The tablets that have been found in the best stage of pres- 
ervation would correspond very nearly with the age of the unfinished 
images in the workshops. The ability to read the characters may have 
continued until 1861, when the Peruvian slavers captured a large num- 
ber of the inhabitants, and among those kidnapped, were all of the of- 
ficials and persons in authority. After this outrage, the traditions, etc., 
embraced by the tablets, seem to have been repeated on particular occa- 
sions, but the value of the characters was not understood and was lost to 
the natives. Aman called UreVaeiko,one of the patriarchs of theislaud, 
professes to have been under instructions in the art of hieroglyphic read- 
ing at the time of the Peruvian visit, and claims to understand most of the 
characters. Negotiations were opened with him for a translation of the 
two tablets purchased; but he declined to furnish any information, on tue 
ground that it had beeu forbidden by the priests. Presents of money and

TE PITO TE HENUA, OK EASTER ISLAND. 515 

valuables were sent him from time to time, but lie invariably replied to all 
overtures that he was now old and feeble and had but a short time to 
live, and declined most positively to ruin his chances for salvation by 
doing what his Christian instructors had forbidden. Finally the old fel- 
low, to avoid temptation, took to the hills with the determination to re- 
main in hiding until utter the departure of the Mohican. It was a mat- 
ter of the utmost importance that the subject should be thoroughly in- 
vestigated before leaving the island, and unscrupulous strategy was the 
only resource after fair means had failed. Just before sundown one 
evening, shortly before the day appointed for our sailing, heavy clouds 
rolled up from the southwest and indications poiuted to bad weather. 
In a heavy down-pour of rain we crossed the island from Vinapu to Ma- 
teveri with Mr. Salmon, and found, as had been expected, that old Ure 
Vaeiko had sought the shelter of his own home on this rough night. He 
was asleep when we entered and took charge of the establishment. 
When he found escape impossible he became sullen, and refused to look 
at or touch a tablet. As a compromise it was proposed that he should 
relate some of the ancient traditions. This was readily acceded to, be- 
cause the opportunity of relating the legends to an interested audience 
did not often occur, and the positive pleasure to be derived from such 
an occasion could not be neglected. During the recital certain stimu- 
lants that had been provided for such an emergency were produced, and 
though not pressed upon our ancient friend, were kept prominently be- 
fore him until, as the night grew old and the narrator weary, he was in- 
cluded as the " cup that cheers" made its occasional rounds. A judi- 
cious indulgence in present comforts dispelled all fears in regard to the 
future state, and at an auspicious moment the photographs of the tab- 
lets owned by the bishop were produced for inspection. Old Ure Vae- 
iko had never seen a photograph before, and was surprised to find how 
faithfully they reproduced the tablets which he had known in his young 
days. A tablet would have met with opposition, but no objection could 
be urged against a photograph, especially something possessed by the 
good bishop, whom he had been instructed to reverence. The photo- 
graphs were recognized immediately, and the appropriate legend related 
with fluency and without hesitation from beginning to end. The story 
of all the tablets of which we had a knowledge was finally obtained, 
the words of the native being written down by Mr. Salmon as they were 
uttered, and afterwards translated info English. 

A casual glance at the Easter Island tablets is sufficient to note the 
fact that they differ materially from oilier k\ liologic writings. The 
pictorial symbols are engraved in regular lines on depressed channels, 
separated by slight ridges intended to protect the hieroglyphics from 
injury by rubbing. In some cases the characters are smaller, and the 
tablets contain a greater Dumber of lines, but in all cases the hiero- 
glyphics are incised and cover both sides as well as the beveled edges 
and hollows of the board upon which they are engraved. The symbols 



516 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

on each line are alternately reversed; those on the first stand upright, 
and those on the next line are upside down, and so on by regular alter- 
nation. 

This unique plan makes it necessary for the reader to turn the tablet 
and change its position at the end of every line; by this means the 
characters will be found to follow in regular procession. The reading 
should commence at the lower left-hand corner, on the particular side 
that will bring the figures erect, and followed as the characters face in 
the procession, turuiug the tablet at the end of each line, as indicated. 
Arriving at the top of the first face, the reading is continued over the 
edge to the nearest line, at the top of the other side, and the descent 
continues in the same manner until the end is reached. The Boustro- 
phedou method is supposed to have been adopted in order to avoid the 
possibility of missing a liue of hieroglyphics. 

Ure Vaeiko's fluent interpretation of the tablet was not interrupted, 
though it became evident that he was not actually reading the charac- 
ters. It was noticed that the shifting of position did not accord with 
the number of symbols on the lines, and afterwards when the photo- 
graph of another tablet was substituted, the same story was continued 
without the change being discovered. The old fellow was quite dis- 
composed when charged with fraud at the close of an all-night session, 
and at first maintained that the characters were all understood, but he 
could not give the signification of hieroglyphics copied indiscriminately 
from tablets already marked. He explained at great length that the 
actual value and significance of the symbols had been forgotten, but the 
tablets were recognized by unmistakable features and the interpreta- 
tion of them was beyond question; just as a person might recognize a 
book in a foreign language and be perfectly sure of the contents with- 
out being able to actually read it. 

Beyond doubt certain legends are ascribed to particular tablets, all 
of which are named, and a reference to those names will recall the ap- 
propriate story from those who do not profess to understand the hiero- 
glyphics. An old man called Kaitae, who claims relationship to the 
last king, Maurata, afterwards recognized several of the tablets from 
the photographs and related the same story exactly as that given pre- 
viously by Ure Vaeiko. 

The writing is composed of pictorial symbols carrying their significa- 
tion in the image they represent. The execution would be a creditable 
production with the assistance of the best etching tools, and is a truly 
wonderful result of patience and industry to be accomplished by means 
of obsidian points. The minute size of the hieroglyphics made it im- 
possible to convey anything more than the general appearance of the 
objects delineated, but the figures may be recognized by their form in 
the outline drawing after the mauner of some of the Egyptian hiero- 
glyphics. The study of the tablets is chiefly difficult on account of the 
way in which actual objects are conventionally treated, and in order to 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 517 

preserve symmetry ami effect, men, canoes, lisli, etc., are represented 
of the same size throughout the lines. 

A careful study of the hieroglyphics of Easter Island is being made 
with the hope that valuable information may be obtained iu regard to 
the early history and origin of the people. Results of an extremely inter- 
esting nature are barely outlined at present and not in shape to be pre- 
sented herewith. It is not considered expedient to attempt an expla- 
nation of the symbols until the subject can be treated exhaustively. As 
an example of the ideographic character of the signs, the tablet contain- 
ing the genealogical tables shows a frequent repetition of the symbol of 
the great spirit Meke-Meke in connection with that of the female vulva^ 
The signification is the birth of a person. The position of the figures 
shows whether the child was the result of marriage, or intrigue, and the 
following figures indicate the date of the birth, the seasons and the ap- 
proximate time. An important feature, in connection with the tablets, is 
the fact that forms have been discovered which have no types on Easter • 
Island, and which may lead to an identification of the locality from 
whence the first settlers migrated. The hieroglyphics include, besides 
the representation of actual objects, figures used by the chiefs, and each 
clan had its distinctive mark. Samples are given in different treaties 
made with the islanders of the sign-manual of some of the chiefs. (See 
Plates XXXV1-XLIX.)

ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF APAI TRADITION. 

Mokouakuta, tke ckief of a powerful clan, wken about to make war 
to revenge tke deatk of one of kis relatives, wko had been killed by 
treacbery, summoned Tiuio, the builder of fowl-bouses, and ordered 
him to construct on tbe windward side of tbe bouse of Tecbo, tbe 
fisherman, a fowl-bouse of one bundred cresent-sbaped stakes. It was 
ordered tbat of tke fowls captured in tbe war tbose witb long tail- 
feathers, and tbe wbite ones, sbould be reserved and sent to this bouse 
for safe-keeping. 

Tke warriors of tke clan assembled promptly at tke council-fire with 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 519 

their faces brilliantly painted and wearing- their distinctive shell neck- 
laces. 

The solemn ceremonies, attendant upon the declaration of war, were 
performed by the assembled braves, in accordance with the ancient 
customs handed down by their forefathers. Obeisance was first made 
to the Sky, each warrior repeating the prayer, "May we be killed in 
battle if we neglect to worship the Great Spirit." The ceremonies 
concluded with obeisance to the god of feathers, each warrior wearing 
the feather-hat of his clan — Era Nuku, the god of feathers, whose 
costume consists of feathers for the head, feathers for the neck, and 
feathers to be waved by the wind. He who brings good luck when 
feathers are worn that are tied by a string of hair. He who protects 
the yams and potato plantations when feathers are tied upon a stick, 
and placed close together between the hills. He who keeps off the evil 
spirit when feathers are planted over the burial-places. 

The god of feathers, whose wife is Manaua. Manana Take came 
from the skies. She once visited the land in the shape of a fish, which 
was captured and given to the king on account of its size and beauty. 
Recognizing the divine nature of the fish, the king was thereafter 
debarred from swimming in the sea. 

(The next hieroglyphics on the tablet are supposed to have been 
written in some ancient language, the key to which has long ago been 
lost. After this unknown section the translation is continued as fol- 
lows) : 

When the island was first created and became known to our fore- 
fathers, the land was crossed with roads beautifully paved with Hat 
stones. The stones were laid close together so artistically that no 
rough edges were exposed. Coffee-trees were growing close together 
along the borders of the road, that met overhead, and the branches 
were laced together like muscles. Heke was the builder of these roads, 
and it was he, who sat in the place of honor in the middle where the 
roads branched away in every direction. These roads were cunningly 
contrived to represent the plan of the web of the gray and black- 
pointed spider, and no man could discover the beginning or the end 
thereof. 

(Here again are some sections of the tablet written in the characters 
that are not understood, after which the following translation is 
made:) 

In that happy land, that beautiful land where Itomaha formerly 
lived with his beloved Ilangaroa, and where Turaki used to listen to 
the voice of the fowl, and feed them with watery food. In that beau- 
tiful land that was governed by gods from heaven, and who lived in 
the water when it was cold. Where the black and white-pointed 
spider would have mounted to heaven, but was prevented by the 
bitterness of the cold. 



520 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Where is our ancient queen? It is known that she was transformed 
into a fish that was finally caught in the still waters. A fish that had 
to be tied by the rope of Heros to be captured. Away, away, if you 
can not name the fish. That lovely fish with the short gills that was 
brought for food to our Great King, and was laid upon a dish that 
rocked this way and that. The same that afterwards formed the 
corner of the stone walk that led to the house of the Great Chief.

the falling rain, and the light of the sun and moon. 

What power has the Great King. upon the land? 

He has the power to populate the earth, to create both kings and 
subjects. 

All hail the power of the Great King who has created the human 
beings, given authority to kings, and created loyal subjects. 

What power has the Great King upon the land ? 

He has the power to create maggots, flies, worms, fleas, and all 
creeping and flying insects. 

All hail the power of the Great King who enables us to withstand 
the attacks of the maggots, flies, worms, fleas, and all manner of insects. 

What power has the Great King? 

All hail the unlimited power of the Great King.

TRADITION IN REGARD TO THE ORIGIN OF THE ISLANDERS. 

The island was discovered by King Hotu-Matua, who came from the 
land in the direction of the rising sun, with two large double canoes 
and three hundred chosen followers. They brought with them pota- 
toes, yams, bananas, tobacco, sugar-cane, and the seeds of various 
plants, including the paper mulberry and the toromiro trees. The first 
landing was made on the islet of Motn Nui, on the north coast, and 
there the first food was cooked that had been tasted for one hundred 
and twenty days. The next day the queen started in one of the canoes 
to explore the coast to the northwest, while the other canoe, in charge of 
the king, rounded the island to the southeast. At Anekena Bay the

TB PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 527 

two canoes met and, attracted by the smooth sand-beach, Hotn-Matua 
landed and named the island "Te-pito tc henna" or "the navel of the 
deep." The queen landed, and immediately afterwards, gave birth to a 
boy, who was named Tuumae-Keke. The landing place was named 
Anekena in honor of the month of August, in which the island was dis- 
covered. All the plants landed from the canoes were appropriated for 
seed, and the people immediately began the cultivation of the ground. 
For the first three months they subsisted entirely upon fish, turtle, 
and the nuts of a creeping-plant found growing along the ground, 
which was named " moki-oo-ne." After the lapse of a number of 
unrecorded years, during which the island had been made to produce 
an abundance of food, and the people had increased and multiplied in 
numbers, Hotu-Matna at an advanced age was stricken with a mortal 
illness. Before his end drew near, the chief men were summoned to 
meet in council. The king nominated his eldest son as his successor 
(Tnumae-Heke), and it was ordained that the descent of the kings 
should always be through the eldest son. This important matter having 
been settled, the island was divided up into districts and portioned out to 
the children of the king as follows: ToTuumae-Heke, the eldest, were 
given the royal establishment and lands extending from Anekena to 
the northwest as far as Mouuga Tea-tea. To Mern, the second son, were 
given the lands between Anekena and Hanga-roa. To Marama, the 
third son, were given the lands between Akahanga and Vinapu. The 
land lying to the northward and westward of Mounga Tea-tea was the 
portion of the fourth son, Raa, and was called Hanga-Toe. To the 
tilth son, Korona ronga, were allotted the lands between Anekena and 
the crater of Rana-Roraku. To the sixth and thelastson weregiveuthe 
lands on the east side of the island. His name was llotu-iti. 

The tradition here goes back before the advent of the people on the 
island, and states that Hotu-Matna and his followers came from a group 
of islands lying towards the rising sun, and the name of the land was 
Marae-toe han, the literal meaning of which is "the burial place." In 
this land, the climate was so intensely hot that the people sometimes 
died from the effects of the heat, and at certain seasons plants and 
growing things were scorched and shriveled up by the burning sun. 

The circumstances that led to the migration are related as follows: 
Hotu-Matna succeeded his father, who was a powerful chief, but his 
reign in the land of his birth, owing to a combination of circumstances 
over which he had no control, was limited to a very lew years. His 
brother, Machaa. tell in love with a maiden famed for her beauty and 
grace, but a rival appeared upon the scene in the person of Oroi, the 
powerful chief of a neighboring clan. After the manner of the sex in 
all ages and climes, this dusky beauty trilled with the affections of her 
suitors and proved tickle-minded. When pressed to make a choice 
between the two, she announced that she would marry Oroi, provided 
he would prove his love by making a pilgrimage around the island, 



528 KEPOIIT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889 



and it was specified that be should walk continually without stopping 
to eat, or to rest by day or night, until the tour of the island was 
completed. Retainers were selected to carry food to be eaten on the 
route, and Oroi started upon his journey, accompanied for the first few 
miles by his affianced bride, who promised upon parting, to permit her 
thoughts to dwell upon nothing but him until his return. The incon- 
stant female eloped with her other lover, Machaa, on the same evening. 
Oroi did not hear this news until he had arrived at the farther end of 
the island; then he returned directly to his home, where he prepared a 
great feast to which he summoned all the warriors of his clan. The 
indignity that had been put upon him was related, and all present 
registered a vow that they would never rest until Hotu-Matua and his 
entire family had been put to death. 

It appears that Machaa was a man of prudence, and seeing that a 
desperate conflict was imminent, he embarked with six chosen follow- 
ers and his bride, in a large double canoe, and with plenty of provisions 
sailed in the night for some more genial clime. The great spiiit 
"Meke-Meke" is supposed to have appeared to him and made it known 
that a large uninhabited island could be found by steering towards the 
setting sun. The laud was sighted after they had been out two months, 
and the canoe was beached on the south side of the island. On the 
second day after their arrival they found a turtle on the beach near 
Auekeua, and one of the men was killed by a blow of its flipper in try- 
ing to turn it over. Two months after they had landed on the island, 
the two canoes with Hotu-Matua and his followers, three hundred in 
number, arrived. 

The desertion of Machaa did not appease the wrath of Oroi, aud war 
to the death was carried on until Hotu-Matua, after being defeated in 
three great battles, was driven to the last extremity. Discouraged by 
his misfortune, and convinced that his ultimate capture and death were 
certain, he determined to flee from the island of Marae-toe-hau, and 
accordingly had two large canoes, 90 feet Jong and 6 feet deep, provis- 
ioned and prepared for a long voyage. In the night, and on the eve of 
another battle, they sailed away, with the understanding that the set- 
ting sun was to be their compass. 

It appears that the intended flight of Hotu-Matua was discovered by 
Oroi at the last moment, and that energetic individual smuggled him- 
self on board of one of the canoes, disguised as a servant. After ar- 
riving upon the island, he hid himself among the rocks at Orougo, aud 
continued to seek his revenge by murdering every unprotected person 
who came in his way. This interesting state of affairs continued for 
several years, but Oroi was finally captured in a net thrown by Hotu- 
Matua and was pounded to death. The tradition continues by a sudden 
jump into the following extraordinary condition of affairs: Many years 
after the death of Hotu-Matua, the island was about equally divided 
between his descendants and the " long-eared race," and between them 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 520 

a deadly lend raged. Long and bloody wars were kept up, and great 
distress prevailed on account of the destruction and neglect of* the crops. 
This unsatisfactory state of affairs was brought to an end, after many 
years' lighting, by a desperate Wattle, in which the "long ears" had 
planned the utter annihilation of their enemies. A long and deep ditch 
was dug across Hoto-iti and covered with brush-wood, and into this the 
"long ears" arranged to drive their enemies, when the brush-wood 
was to besetou lire and every man exterminated. The trap was found 
out, and the plan circumvented by opening the battle prematurely and 
in the night. The "long ears" were driven into the ditch they had 
built, and murdered to a man. 

After the defeat and utter annihilation of the "loug-eared race," 
the tradition goes on to state that peace reigned on the island, and the 
people increased in numbers and prosperity. In the course of time 
dissensions arose between the different families or clans, which led to 
open hostilities. Kaina, the chief of the Hotu-iti clan, and a descend- 
ant of the sixth son of the first king, proved himself a valiant warrior, 
and his possessions were increased by encroachments upon the domain 
of his neighbors. He died and was succeeded by his son, Iluriavai, 
who inaugurated his introduction into the office by a three days' en- 
gagement, in which the chiefs of two neighboring clans were killed. 
Several claus now combined forces, and alter desperate lighting the 
Hotu-iti people were defeated, half of them taking refuge in a cave on 
the face of the cliff on the northeast side of the island, and the rest 
on the islet of Marotiri. 

The besieged parties were watched night and day by their vigilant 
enemies, and were finally reduced to the verge of starvation. A chief, 
named Poya, had just finished a large double canoe at Ilanga-roa, 
which he called Tuapoi. This was dragged across the island and 
launched at Anahava. .Every day tin's canoe, filled with fighting men, 
cruised around the islet of Maroiri, making attacks upon the besieged 
Hotu-iti people whenever opportunity offered. As the people were 
reduced by privations, the number of prisoners captured increased day 
by day. The captives were; taken to a place called Hanga-wi-aihi- 
toke-rau and portioned out to the different clans, and were immediately 
cooked and eaten. This is said to In- the origin of cannibalism on the 
island, and is supposed to have been prompted by revenge. 

Cannibalism, however, proved a double-pointed sword that caused 
dissensions in the ranks, and finally resulted in the liberation of a part 
of the besieged people. A chief named Oho-taka-tore happened to lie 

absent upon one occasion, and upon his return found the bodies had all 
been distributed and his claims completely ignored, lie demanded 
his share of t he spoils, and was informed t hat " a man who sleeps late 

in the morning can not expect to see the sun rise." Feeling degraded 

by the slight, Oho-taka-tore turned his feather-hat hind-side before, to

indicate that the alliance was broken, and with his men marched off 
the held. 

On the road he stopped at Vaka-piko, at the house of his daughter- 
in-law, to inquire after his son. The " lady" received him with demon- 
strations of respect, and while listening to the story of his wrongs, 
stood behind him and picked fleas out of his head, which, in accord- 
ance with the native customs, was the most delicate compliment that 
one individual could show another. 

Upon the return of her husband, whose name was Moa, the woman 
related the particulars of the visit of his father. Moa said nothing 
about the state of his feelings, but arose at sunrise and dug up a lot 
of potatoes and yams, which he baked in an oven. Towards evening 
he brought out his fish-net and employed himself iu arranging the 
floats and sinkers. After dark he wrapped up his potatoes and yams 
in sugar cane and leaves, shouldered his net, and started off, after in- 
forming his wife that he was going fishing, fie hid his net in the 
rocks at Kahiherea and then went to Mounga-tea-tea, where a palm tree 
was growing, from which he cut and trimmed eight large branches. 
At Ngaua Moa he found the camp of the men who guarded the cliff over- 
looking the cave where the Hotu-iti people were imprisoned, so he 
turned and went down by the sea-shore. The men stationed there to 
guard the approach were all asleep, and Moa managed by great cau- 
tion to pass them without being discovered. Having arrived near the 
cave he was challenged, and replied, "I am Moa, who seeks revenge 
while helping you." One of the besieged men, named Tokihai, de- 
scended from the cave and received the grip of friendship by being 
clasped around the belly. Moa took his food into the cave and dis- 
tributed it among the thirty famished and thoroughly discouraged 
men who remaiued alive. 

While the great canoe was making its predatory excursions to the 
islet, the combined forces had not neglected the people who had taken 
refuge in the cave. Every day a large net filled with men was lowered 
from the top of the cliff, and from it stones were hurled into the cave, 
killing and maiming the defenseless people. Moa produced his palm 
branches and instructed his friends how to make hooks from pieces of 
human bone, which could be fastened to the poles and used as grapples. 

Before daylight everything was in readiness, and when the net was 
lowered abreast of the opening, it was caught by the hooks and drawn 
in the cave, and the men in it dispatched almost without resistance. 
The prisoners got into the net and were hoisted to the top, where by rea- 
son of the surprise and the fierceness of their fighting their enemies 
were defeated and put to flight. 

It happened that on the night of Moa's visit to the cave, Huriarai and 
a man named Vaha, who were with the party on the small island of Ma- 
rori, became desperate from hunger and made an effort to capture one 
of the men guarding the sea-beach, The sentry saw one of the men 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 531 

Swimming towards him ; it proved to be the chief Huriarai, who was so 
much exhausted that he was clubbed to death without making much 
resistance. Vaha. however, landed some distance off, and creeping upon 
the sentry killed him while he was bending over the body of his victim. 
Vaha hastily buried the body of his chief among the rocks and taking 
his victim upon his back swam back to his companions on the islet. The 
people there were without means of making a fire and the body had to 
be eaten raw. In the morning, when they saw the escape of their com- 
rades from the cave and the desperate lighting on the cliff, they all swam 
ashore and joined forces. 

The traditions, from this point, are a record of tribal wars, abounding 
in feats of personal bravery and extraordinary occurrences, but of little 
value to the history of the island. The discovery of the island by Hotu- 
Matua and his baud of three hundred, together with the landing already 
referred to, is probably correct and seems natural enough down to the 
division of the laud and the death of the first king. The wars and 
causes that led to the migration of the people from that unknown land, 
called Marae-toe-hau, are no doubt based upon a foundation of facts. 
There is no good reason for doubting the description of the climate of 
their former home, which would, if accepted, locate it somewhere about 
the equator, or at all events in the tropics. The heat could not be the 
effect of volcanic action, or their legends would not state that the crops 
were burned up by the sun at certain seasons. 

The improbable, not to say impossible, part of the story comes in, 
where Machaa steals away and lauds upon the same island which his 
brother's party reach two months later, by simply steering towards the 
setting sun. There is not one chance in a million, that two canoes could 
sail for thousands of miles, steering by such an uncertain and indefinite 
course, and strike the same little island. The tradition states that Ho- 
tu-Matua found the island uninhabited, and immediately contradicts 
this, by the ridiculous story of his brother and his followers having been 
there two months. It is not unlikely thai the natives, anxious to main- 
tain the credit of the discovery of the island, attempt to account for 
the presence of an earlier people in this way. This might account for 
the killing of one of Machaa's men by the turtle, for it has no possible 
bearing upon the story, beyond the fact that it would account for Ho- 
tu-Matua finding a tomb or burial-place- on the beach al Anekena, when 
he first landed. 

The story of Oroi disguising himself as a servant and sailing for 
months in an open canoe, tilled with naked savages, without his identity 
being discovered, is too absurd to be considered, beyond ascribing an 
origin to the enemy or enemies who murdered Hotu-Matua's people, and 
whose stronghold was on the rocky cliffs near Orongo. One peculiar 
feature of the tradition is the allusion to the fighting-net, which must 

have been something after the fashion of those i\s^\ in old Roman times. 
These nets are represented to have been square and weighted at the 



532 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. ' 

corners with stones. A lanyard was fastened to the center, and the net 
was thrown over an antagonist, who was beaten to death while en- 
tangled in its meshes. It is worthy of remark that nothing of this sort 
has been discovered among the Polynesians or their contemporaries on 
the coast of America. 

The suddenness with which the tradition jumps into the warfare be- 
tween the descendants of the tirst king and the "long-eared race" is 
startling, because no previous reference has been made to such a race on 
the island. It is hardly possible that the "long-ears" were descended 
from people who landed with them on the island, for those that came 
with Hotu-Matua were of the same clan, and it is fair to presume that 
the same customs obtained among them all. Besides, the legends all 
make a distinction between the "long-eared" race and the descendants 
of the first king. The "long-ears" appear to have been a power in the 
land at au early period in the history of the island, though they were 
eventually defeated and exterminated by the others. 

It is possible that there has been more than one migration of people 
to the island, and that their traditions have been mingled together, but 
there can be no reasonable doubt about the progenitors of the pres- 
ent islanders being of the Malayo-Polynesian stock. It is difficult to 
account for the statement, so frequently repeated throughout the legends, 
that Hotu-Matua came from the eastward and discovered the land by 
steering towards the setting sun, because the chart shows no islands in 
that direction which would answer the description of "Marae-toe-hau." 

TRADITION REGARDING OBSIDIAN SPEAR-POINTS. 

The implements of warfare brought to the island by King Hotu- 
Matua and his followers were few in number, and in the course of time 
became brokeu, lost, or destroyed. The clans were continually at war 
with each other, but from the want of proper weapons the most desper- 
ate encounters resulted in little loss of life. Spears were improvised 
with heads made of the sharp edges of the calabash, but they proved in- 
efficient weapons and did little execution. During the reign of Atura- 
ugi, the sixth king, a man living near the crater of the Raua Kau, while 
returning to his home after sundown from Temanevai, where he and his 
companions had been engaged in a useless struggle, stepped in the 
darkness upon a sharp stone that cut his foot like a knife. He carried 
the stone home with him, and in the morning found it to be black vol- 
canic glass, which upon being broken showed vitreous edges such as 
had cut his foot. Believing he had discovered an effective material for 
the manufacture of spear-heads, he substituted the obsidian for the 
calabash points and went forth to meet his enemies. The new weapon 
proved more puissant than he had hoped for, and havoc was created in 
the ranks of his opponents. Armed with spear heads obtained from 
the obsidian mountain Orito, the discoverer and his clan swept every- 
thing before them until the new material became known to all the 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTER ISLAND. 533 

people. Since the time of this discovery the encounters of the island- 
ers are characterized as more sanguinary. 

TRADITION REGARDING FISH HOOKS. 

In the time of Atua Ure Rangi, the seventeenth king, the image- 
makers were exempt from all other kinds of work, and the fishermen 
were taxed for their chief support. The fish-hooks in use were made of 
stone, so hard that many months of chipping and grinding were re- 
quired to fashion one fit for service, and the most perfect hooks, even 
in the hands of expert fishermen, permitted the escape of a large pro- 
portion of the fish. A youth named Urevaiaus, who was descended 
from a long line of fishermen, living at Hanga Pico, became prominent 
as one of the most skillful fishermen on the island. His outfit con- 
tained hooks bequeathed to him by his forefathers, but he became 
discouraged by the want of success which he thought his labors de- 
manded, and much time was devoted to a consideration of the subject. 
One day, after a number of large and choice fish had escaped from his 
hooks, he determined to spend the entire night in the worship of the 
god Mea Kahi. About midnight, while he was still at his devotions, 
the spirit of an ancient fisherman named Tirakoka appeared, and made 
known the fact that his want of success was due to the inefficiency of 
the hooks. The spirit directed him to go to the cave in which his 
father's remains had been interred, and secure a piece of the thigh- 
bone, out of which a proper hook might be constructed. Urevaiaus 
became so much frightened by his interview with the spirit, that he 
failed to remember fully all the instructions that had been given, but he 
went to the cave the next day and secured the thigh-bone of his pater- 
nal parent. For many days he went out in his canoe regularly, but in- 
stead of fishing, his entire attention was devoted to the manufacture of 
an improved hook. During this period his boat returned empty every 
evening, and his want of success excited the open ridicule of his com- 
panions and the concern of his friends, but he persevered until he had 
fashioned a bone-hook with barbed point. 

When ready to test his new invention, a place was selected at a dis- 
tance from his companions, and his boat was quickly filled with the finest 
fish. The extraordinary success of the young fisherman, in time excited 
the envy and jealousy of his companions, and his persistent refusal of 
all inducements to part with the secret led to a serious quarrel and 

hitter enmity. A sudden attack was finally planned upon I 'revaiaus 
while at work upon the fishing grounds; in the effort to preserve his 
secret the youth lost his life, but the new form of books was found in 
his boat and the invention became known to the fraternity.

LIST OF ETHNOGRAPHIC SPECIMENS OBTAINED AT EASTER ISLAND. 

Wooden image. — Called Moai Taugata. Male figure made of toro- 
miro wood, with eyes of bone and obsidian. (Plate L, fig. 1.) 

Wooden image. — Called Moai Kva-kva. Male figure made of toro- 
miro wood, with eyes of bone and obsidian, and breast-bone and ribs 
sharply defined. (Plate L, fig. 2.) 

Wooden image. — Called Moai Papaa. Female figure made of toro- 
miro wood, with eyes of bone and obsidian. (Plate L, fig. 3.) 

These figures have been called household gods, and were never wor 
shipped, though they were regarded as the representations of certain 
spirits. Similar figures were made to represent deceased chiefs and 

* Mahuta Ariiki had a son named Tuu-Koiho, who made the first stone image on 
the Island. This son died before his father. 

t These two kings reigned at the same time. The son rebelled against his father, 
and finally killed him.

persons of note, and were given a place of honor at feasts and cere- 
monies. 

Stone image. — Called Moai Maea. Male figure; held in the same esti- 
mation as those made of wood. (Plate LI, fig. 1.) 

Wooden clubs. — Called Ua. Made of toro niiro wood, 6 feet long, the 
point slightly widened and the handle ornamented with a hi fronted 
head with eyes of bone and obsidian. These clubs were only used as 
batons of office by the chiefs, and the handle was supposed to represent 
the effigy of the owner. (Plate LII, figs. 1 and 2.) 

Wooden club. — Called Poa. Made of heavy wood, about 30 inches 
long, gradually widened from the handle to a broad blade, rounded 
at the end. These were used for fighting and were handled with great 
dexterity. 

Wooden club. — Called Ao. Made of light wood, used as wands in 
dancing. The flattened ends are sometimes ornamented with heads 
supposed to represent females noted for skill and grace in this accom- 
plishment. (Plate LIU, figs. 1 aud 2.) 

Wooden club. — ('ailed Ariiki. Made of toro-miro wood, the end 
being turned at right angles from the short handle. The club is orna- 
mented all over with heads. This was the baton of the king aud used 
only by him. Obtained with much difficulty and expense. 

Calabash. — Called Hue Vai. Opened at the small end only, used as 
a water vessel, and for domestic purposes. 

Calabash.— Called Epu Moa. Known as the fowl gourd, and a super- 
stition ascribes a beneficial influence over the chickens fed and watered 
from it. 

Calabash — Called Tata. Used chiefly in boats for bailing. 

Calabash. — Very old specimen obtained from an ancient tomb, 
covered with hieroglyphics similar to those found on the incised tab- 
lets. These calabashes grow in profusion on the island, but are worthy 
of note on account of the prominent place they occupy in the traditions, 
and because the seed was introduced by the original settlers. 

Fishnet. — Called Ivupenga Maito. This form of net has been in use 
from an early period, and is made from the fiber of wild hemp. Nets 
of different sizes used in fishing, as well as those for fighting and other 
purposes, were of similar material and mesh. (Plate XIII.) 

Feather hat. — Called Vana vana. Head-dress made of black and 
green variegated feathers, used only in delivering a challenge to com- 
bat for revenge. (Plate LIV, fig. 1.) 

Feather hat. — Called Han Kura kura. Small head-dress of brown or 
red feathers worn by soldiers in time ol war. (Plate LIV, fig. 2.) 

Feather hat. — ('ailed Han Pan-leu ki. Head-dress of Ion-, black, 

green, and variegated feathers worn by dancing-people. (Plate LIV, 
fig. 3.) 
Featherhat. — Called Han Tara. Small headdress of trimmed featb

cis ornamented by long tail feathers behind ; used by chiefs on occa- 
sions of ceremony. (Plate LIV, fig. 4.) 

Feather hat. — Called Han Vaero. Head-dress used in dancing, and 
formerly at marriage feasts. (Plate LV, fig. 1.) 

Feather hat. — Called Han Hie-hie. Large and heavy head dress 
made of black feathers worn by chiefs as insignia of office. These 
hats are made of chicken feathers secured by the quill ends to a founda- 
tion of knitted hemp, intended to fit the head closely. They are fre- 
quently referred to in the traditions. (Plate LV, fig. 2.) 

}Val1et. — Called Kate. Made from bullrushes taken from the crater 
of Rana-Kau. (Plate LI, fig. 2.) 

Mat. — Called Moenga. Made of bullrushes and used for sleeping 
mats. 

Obsidian spear-points. — Plate LVL — Large collection showing the nine 
classes into which they are divided by the natives. Fig. 1, narrow leaf- 
shaped spear-head, called Mataa Nutakuku. Fig. 2, wide round-pointed 
spear-head, called Mataa Rei-pure-pure-rova. Fig. 3, narrow and long- 
pointed spear-head, called Mataa Neho-inango. Fig. 4, narrow spade- 
shaped spear-head, called Mataa Hikntiveva. Fig. 5, broad straight- 
edged spear-head, called Mataa-hae. Fig. 6, smooth round edged spear- 
head, called Mataa Aro-kiri. Fig. 7, broad fan-shaped spear-head, 
called Mataa Nutu-kuku. Fig. 8, concave and convex sided spear-head, 
called Mataa Roa. Fig. 9, long sharp, irregular pointed spear head, 
called Mataa Hai haerve. These spear-heads were fastened to poles 
about 8 feet long, by lashings of hemp, and formed the chief weapon 
used by the natives in their frequent strifes. They were thrown to 
a distance, as well as a thrusting weapon, much after the mauner in 
which the Zulus use their assagais. The volcanic glass of which 
the points were made, crops out at many places on the island, but was 
chiefly obtained at the obsidian mountain of Orito. Spear-heads of 
different shapes and sizes were dependent upon individual taste and 
skill. The best samples in the collection were purchased from Mr. Sal- 
mon ; others were found in the tombs and burial-places; and some were 
picked up on the old battle-grounds. 

Fetish-board. — Called Timoika. Broad, flat paddle made of whale- 
bone, 30 inches long and 14 inches wide. This wand is used in working 
a charm against an enemy. The injured individual while performing a 
sort of convulsive dance, makes mystic movements with the paddle, 
meanwhile muttering incantatious in a monotonous tone. The result is 
believed to be the speedy death of the person against whom the fetish 
is invoked. (Plate LIII, fig. 3.) 

Potato fetish. — Called Rapa. Small, light paddle double bladed, 
about 24 inches long, painted light red in color. It was used with ap- 
propriate ceremonies at times when the potato crop was in danger from 
insects or drought, and was believed to ward off and guard against evil 
spirits. (Plate LIII, fig. 4.)

TE PITO TE HENUA, OR EASTEE ISLAND. 537 

Stone adzes. — Called Toki. The collection comprises twenty-five dif- 
ferent sizes, called by distinctive names which signify the use for which 
they are designed. Tools of this class were always used in a wooden 
handle. (Plate LVII.) 

Stone knife. — Called Hoe. Ground down to a knife-blade with a 
point and cutting - edge, used principally for fashioning the eyes and 
faces of the images. (Plate LI, fig. 3.) 

Ax handles. — Miro Toki. Hard-wood, with natural joint, used for 
holding stone implements. (Plate LVII.) 

Fish god. — Called Mea Ilea. This rough, ill-shaped stone was one of 
the objects really worshipped by the natives. Some of them bear evi- 
dences of tool marks, but it does not appear that any effort was made to 
carve them into shape or decorate them. These gods were never com- 
mon, and were possessed by communities or clans, and not by individ- 
uals. The legends claim that they were all brought to the island by 
Hotu Matua and the first settlers. (Plate LI, fig. 4.) 

Bonito god. — Called Mea Kahi. A stone with apparently no distin- 
guishing characteristics, and nothing to merit the profound religious 
homage paid to it. It is not clear why the bonito should have the dis- 
tinction of a separate god from the other fish, unless it be for the reason 
that it appears in great numbers in these waters, and has always been 
highly esteemed as an article of food. Fish always constituted an im- 
portant diet with the natives, and the abundance in • which they were 
found was ascribed to the faithful and constant adoration of these stone 
gods. (Plate LI, fig. 5 ) 

Fowl god. — Called Mea Moa. A beach pebble with slight traces of 
tool-marks, but it might readily be passed among other stones without 
attracting attention. To the fowl god is ascribed the custody of chick- 
ens, and its beneficial influence was secured by being placed under a 
setting hen for a short time before the eggs were hatched. (Plate LI, 
fig. G.) 

Stone Fish Hook. — Called Mugai Kihi. These primitive hooks, now 
very rare on the island, were made of the hardest rock to be obtained, 
and were ground into shape by long and constant rubbing. (Plate 
LVIII, fig. 3.) 

Hone fish hooks. — ('ailed Mugai Iri. In accordance with an ancient 
superstition, these hooks were manufactured from the thigh-bones of 
deceased fishermen. The curve was fashioned with a small barb which 
prevented the escape of the fish. The form is so perfectly adapted to 
the purpose that the natives still use their old bone hooks in preference 
to those <•!' European make. A fish hook of similar design was used 
by the Indians of Santa Cruz Island. (Plate LVIII, figs. 1 and 2.) 

Incised tablets. — Called Ilokau Bongo Kongo. Two specimens in ex- 
cellent state of preservation, showing the hieroglyphics used in the 
written language. (Plates XXXVIII-XLI.) 

Double paddle. — Called Mata Kao kao. Made of heavy wood, bal- 



538 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

aiiced by wide blades ornamented with outlined faces. Used in the 
ancient canoes in a similar manner to that practiced by the Indians of 
America. (Plate LII, fig. 3.) 

Ancient scull oars — Called Mata Kao. Angular float of peculiar 
shape and unique design attached to a long handle. Used for steering 
and sculling very large canoes. Very old and highly prized by the 
islanders as the only specimen of the scull-oar used by their ancestors. 
(Plate L1X ) 

Human skulls.— Called Puoko Iri. An examination of these skulls 
shows very little difference between the crania of the present people and 
those found in the most ancient tombs. Three specimens obtained from 
the King's platform have hieroglyphics engraved upon them, which sig- 
nify the clan to which they belonged. (Plate L.) 

Native cloth. — Called Hami Nua. Made of the inner bark of the hi- 
biscus and paper-mulberry trees. The manufacture of the " tappa " has 
now ceased altogether. (Plate LI, fig. 7.) 

Tattooing implements. — Called Ta Koua. Tools used for puncturing 
the skin. Made of bird bones. 

Needles. — Called Iri. Both bone and wooden needles used for sewing 
tappa cloth, and other varieties for knitting meshes of nets. (Plate 
LX, fig. 1.) 

Fetish stones. — Called Atua Maugaro. A collection obtained by dig- 
ging beneath the. door- posts of the ancient dwellings. The majority are 
simply beach pepples; others have been formed by rubbing; and one is a 
triangular-shaped stone with a face outlined upon it. These were placed 
beneath the houses, with much ceremony, and were supposed to ward 
off evil influences. (Plate LX, fig. 2.) 

Neck ornaments. — Called Hoko Ngao. Carved w T ood in fanciful de- 
signs worn duriug the dance. 

Pigments. — Called Penetuli. Natural paints used by being ground 
down in the heated juice of the sugar cane. 

Frescoed slabs. — Taken from the inner walls and ceilings of the stone 
houses at Orougo. (Plate XXIII.) 

Fetish stones. — Buried under the corner-stones of the houses. 

POLYNESIAN ARCHEOLOGY. 

The most aucient monuments of Polynesia are the lithic and mega- 
lithic remains, coincident in style and character with the Druidical 
circles of Europe, and the exact counterpart of those of Stonehenge and 
Carnac in Brittany. These earlier efforts of the human art are invaria- 
bly the remains of temples, places of worship, or of edifices dedicated 
in some way to the religion and superstitions of extinct generations, 
whose graves cover every island and reef. The most numerous, and 
perhaps the most ancient structures, are quadrangular in shape, and 
are composed of loose lava stones, forming a wall of great firmness and 
strength. These temples frequently exceed 100 feet in length, with a

proportionate width, and wore designed to be roofless. They contain 
remains of altars composed of the same materials as the wall of tin- 
main inclosure, generally located at one end, and in shape resembling 
parallelograms. In many eases, these edifices are in as perfect a state 
of preservation as when countless numbers of human victims were im- 
molated upon their altars, though time has obliterated all traces of 
every thing perishable. 

In the search for prehistoric remains, the diversified character of the 
many islands that dot the South Sea should be borne in mind. Coral 
groups and atolls, these wonderful formations produced by the ceaseless 
work of zoopbytic animals, being of comparatively recent creation, 
were perhaps merely tide-water reefs, when the islands of purely vol- 
canic character were peopled by lawless and turbulent tribes, constantly 
engaged in warfare and in making depredations upon each other. Even 
where there is sufficient evidence of antiquity to warrant the search, 
the absence of monuments upon the low-lying islands of coral formation, 
may be accounted for by the lack of suitable material for their construc- 
tion, or to the destroying hurricanes that occasionally sweep across 
this part of the Pacific, which arc accompanied by a furious sea that 
breaks completely over the narrow atolls, carrying death and devasta- 
tion to all things animate and inanimate. 

The height of the atolls, in many cases, does not exceed 5 or G feet 
above the normal level of the sea surrounding them, and instances are 
unfortunately abundant, of islands that have been transformed in a few 
hours, from a scene of -tropical luxuriance and with a contented people 
surrounded by nature's most bountiful gifts, to one of utter barrenness 
and desolation. The largest and most important islands of Polynesia 
are of volcanic character, and bear evidences of having been inhabited 
from a remote period. Here may be duplicated the Teocallis of Palen- 
que, Copan, and Uxmal. In some islands these ancient monuments 
were searched out with great difficulty, having been so completely 
overgrown with dense tropical vegetation that their existence was not 
suspected by the indifferent people of to-day. 

While the islanders never advanced to a high civilization, and their 
best efforts consist in cromlechs, dolmens, and elevated platforms or 
truncated pyramids, their handiwork is still preserved, and points with 
abundant interest to the history of a rude and early age. 

The primitive Polynesians, like their contemporaries, the Incas of 
Peru, may be judged in regard to their condition and history, by the 
monuments they have left, for with the exception of Easter Island, 
there is no trace of their having possessed a written language. Tribes 
flourished, were Conquered and passed out of existence, without leaving 
a trace behind them except perhaps, a shadowy t radii ion. The natives 
in tins genial climate have always dwelt in rude structures of thatch and 

cane, which after a few \ ears of abandonment would decay and leave no 
sign behind, unless it be a few broken implements lying about. Among 



540 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

them, traditions have always been preserved with care, and it is won- 
derful to find how the history of a people can be followed in this way 
for hundreds of years. The Samoans claim a complete chronicle dating 
through twenty-two generations of the reigning family of Malietoa, and 
extending over a period of eight hundred years, while the Tongans can 
chronicle a fairly accurate history of their priesthood through twelve 
centuries.* 

The priests have usually been the custodians of the national tradi- 
tions, and there is sufficient evidence to show that every precaution was 
taken to have them handed down from one generation to another, pure 
and unchanged, for oral record was their only means of committing to 
posterity the deeds of their ancestors. 

To be intrusted with the traditions, constituted of itself an office of 
high dignity, and the holder was afforded the protection of a taboo of 
the most rigorous character. 

Family records were perpetuated with the national history, but as 
might be expected, there was a tendency to embellish them when ex- 
tended back beyond a reasonable limit, with mythological personages 
and improbable occurrences. Still the extraordinary power of these 
keepers to preserve unimpaired for centuries, events and facts or even 
the geueaology of important families, would astonish those who are fa- 
miliar only with written history, and whose memories depend upon arti- 
ficial aids. Except in a few cases, the traditions of the natives do not 
extend back far enough to throw much light upon the ancient monu- 
ments found upon the islands. This is due in a measure to the fact, that 
in only isolated localities have the people lived unmolested for any 
great length of time. The tribes were continually at war with one an- 
other. From love of conquest, and jealousy, no tribe was safe from the 
depredations of its neighbor, although living upon terms of supposed 
friendship. The love of war induced frequent expeditions planned for 
the destruction of the tribes of adjacent islands, while occasionally a 
combination was made for more extensive operations against the unsus- 
pecting natives of a different group. The visitors usually put to death 
the fighting men of the conquered tribes and absorbed the others. The 
traditions of both parties were preserved separately for a time, but they 
naturally tended to merge together, and in this state, a combination of 
the glories of both tribes were handed down never to be unraveled to 
their succeeding generations. The monuments of antiquity scattered 
throughout Polynesia, with the exception of Easter Island, increase in 
importance as we advance to the westward, commencing with the cir- 
cles of uncut stones, and advancing by regular steps until we arrive 
at the more elaborate sculptures. This fact indicates the decline that 

* These genealogies, although widely known and generally admitted to be true, 
have received the special investigation of some of the missionaries. The Rev. Shir- 
ley Baker, now premier of Tonga, assures us that there is no reason to doubt them, 
and that on the other hand there are many reasons for accepting them as absolute 
truth.

took place in the social and mental culture of the people as they rami- 
fied eastward through tlie various islands of the Pacific. Detachments 
arriving at the different groups separated into distinct communities as 
accident or fancy directed : here they became segregated, and rapidly 

degenerated in knowledge and in the arts. 

Starting with the Sandwich Islands, we lind that the Hawaiian pre- 
historic remains are confined to the most primitive forms of structures, 
such as the remains of the pagan temple at Waikiki, and the enormous 
heiau at Punepa near Iolo, both of which are notable types of walled 
inclosures, and also the catacombs of Waimea, which do not greatly 
differ from some of the places of sepulture in other islands. 

Farther to the South and West, the Marquesas and Society groups 
show nothing beyond the primitive works of people who have passed 
away ages ago, leaving no other signs of their having existed. 

The island of Eapa-titi, in mid Pacific and just outside the tropics, 
contains evidences of a numerous population at some remote period. 
The island is remarkably mountainous, though quite small, with pinna- 
cles rising to the height of 2,000 feet, and precipitous cliffs jutting into 
the sea. Massive forts commaud all the principal valleys; they are 
constructed of stone; built in terraces; and furnished with towers for 
observation and rallying points.* 

In the Friendly Islands are found some interesting relics of antiquity. 
Near the ancient metropolis of Moa, on the island of Tongatabu, and 
about 1 Li miles from Nukualofa, the present capital of the group, arc 
the graves of the Tui-Tongas. 

These embrace nineteen truncated pyramids, measuring about 100 feet 
square on the base lines, and rising in three terraces to a height of 25 
feet. The stones used in their construction are of coral concrete, and 
many of the huge blocks arc 18 feet long by 5£ feet high and 3 feet 
thick, and weigh fully 20 tons each. 

The labor of building these tombs was enormous, and when it is con- 
sidered that the great blocks were cut from the coral reef about .'! miles 
distant, and transported to the spot by savages who were ignorant of the 
laws of mechanics, and who were without appliances, we can not fail to 
be. lost in wonder at the magnitude of the work accomplished. These 
pyramids are of various ages, extending over a period of twelve hun- 
dred and fifty years. They are overgrown by a dense forest of fao and 
banyan trees, of immense size and great age, t be roots of which have dis- 
lodged and thrown down some of the largest stones. The Tui-Tongas 
were high-priests and their genealogy has been carefully preserved. 

* In 1867, tli«' French purchased the sovereignty of tlm little island for a gallon of 
run i and some <>I<1 clothes, thus cutting out a prospective American Steam-ship Com- 
pany t Ii.it had fixed upon it for a coal depot. Coal is found here in small quantities, 

and this fact lias been adduced In support of the theorj ofa sul >rged contineul in 

the Pacific, a fallacy evident to the geologist. Although there are several haj 
landing may he made at any poiul owing t<> the remarkable Bmoothuess of the sea. 
The people bear a close resemblance to tin- New Zealauders. 



542 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The priesthood was hereditary, descending from father to son. Under 
the laws of Tonga the high-priests could marry only the daughters of 
the king. Their sons became priests, and the daughters occupied a 
position analogous to that of the Vestal Virgins and were not permitted 
to marry. This long line is now extinct, the last of the Tui-Tongas hav- 
ing been laid with his fathers in 1863. 

About 6 miles beyond these tombs, on the eastern shore, stands an 
ancient cromlech, or more properly speaking a dolmen. This interesting 
monument is composed of three blocks of coral concrete. The two up- 
rights are 14 feet high, 8 feet wide and nearly 4 feet thick, and weigh 
over 15 tons each, while the cross-piece is somewhat smaller and weighs 
about 10 tons. The native tradition is that these larger masses of stone 
were cut from the coral reef about 2 miles distant, aud that the vertex 
was brought by one of their large canoes from Wallis Island. While it 
is possible for this legend to be founded upon fact, there is room for 
strong doubt, since the same formation exists upon both islands ; but 
the difficulty of handling a stone of that size aud weight, and of carrying 
it a distance of 600 miles by sea, would hardly be warranted when it 
could be quarried on their own shores. Viewed, however, as a trophy, 
and the cromlech as a sort of triumphal arch to commemorate a victory, 
(for the Tongans were perhaps the most successful of the ocean rovers 
of the Pacific) the legend of the stone seems entitled to greater credence 
than the neglected pile would at first warrant. The traditions do not 
go back far enough to tell us by whom this cromlech was erected, but 
simply assert its erection by one of the early kings on the advent of his 
dynasty, a fact which the disintegration of the stone, due to age, would 
seem to corroborate. The Samoans formerly erected stone pillars to the 
memory of their chiefs, but the most interesting relic of former ages, in 
this group, is the ruins of a heathen temple located in the mountains 
near the center of the island of Opolu. Secreted in an almost in- 
accessible gully, this temple was built in the form of an ellipse, meas- 
uring 57 feet one way by 39 feet the other. The roof was evidently 
thatched with pandanus leaves, as is the custom to the present day, but 
three large columns of basaltic rock formed the center supports, while 
the eaves rested upon the pillars of the same stone placed at intervals 
of 3 feet apart arouud the ellipse. Many of these stones are still stand- 
ing, but the site has been almost obscured by a dense tropical growth. 

Within a few feet of the old temple is an ancient tomb covered with 
a large block of stone and marked by an upright basaltic column. Sa- 
moau legends do not give much information about this ruiu, but the 
Tongan traditions hold that the temple was built by them, after they had 
conquered the Samoans, aud that the tomb is that of one of the Tui- 
Tongas who accompanied the successful expedition, aud who died and 
was buried alongside of tlie temple. This conquest took place at least 
eight hundred years ago, for it was about this time that Malietoa I. was 



TE PITO TE HENUA, OE EASTEE ISLAND. 543 

made king, for his bravery ami success in freeing his country from the 
Tongan yoke. 

Plans were made to open this tomb, but lor the lack of time could not 
be carried out, and the observations on this interesting relic were con- 
fined to one hasty visit. 

Continuing still farther to the westward, to the island of Tinian, one 
of the Ladrones, are found two ranges of stone columns, over a dozen 
in number, and somewhat similar in size and shape to those of the 
cromlech at Tongatabn; but the curious feature of this ruin is that 
each column is surmounted by a large semi-globe, flat surface upward, 
weighing 4 tons. Freycinet supposes them to be supports of wooden 
ceilings to houses, that long ago have fallen into ruin, but other author- 
ities assert that they are sepulchral urns. The natives call them "the 
houses of the ancients." 

Upon the adjacent islands are numerous remains of a similar charac- 
ter, but in most cases the columns are smaller. 

In the island of Pouape, Caroline group, are found remains of a 
higher grade of stone work and which are a puzzle to ethnologists.* 
Upon the bank of a creek that empties into Metalanien harbor is an 
inclosure with massive walls built of basaltic prisms 300 feet long and 
35 feet high. There is a gateway opening upon the creek composed of 
enormous basaltic columns laid flat, inside of which is a court inclosed 
by walls 30 feet high. There are terraces against the wall inside, also 
built of basaltic prisms 8 feet high and 12 feet wide. The inclosure is 
nearly square and is divided into three parts by low walls running north 
and south. 

In the center of each court is a closed chamber 14 feet square, orna- 
mented with basaltic columns and roofed with the same stone. On the 
central ridge of the opposite side of the island, 10 miles distant, are a 
large number of very line basaltic columns, and this must have been the 
quarry for the structure just described, for the configuration of the land 
is such that roads would have been impracticable, and the only deduc- 
tion is that the material must have been taken down to the coast and 
thence by water to the location on the creek. 

This is reported to have been the home of the buccaneers, but it is 
impossible that they could have put up works of such magnitude. 
There are other ruins on the island, and also some mounds of consider- 
able size, L2 feet high and a quarter of a mile long. On Kusai, and other 
islands of the group are found ruins, but those of Ponapeare by far the 
most remarkable. 

Though not properly in the province of the work, a short description 
by Mr. Wallace of some of the architectural wonders of Java is in- 
serted, lie estimates the date of their construction at five hundred 
years ago when the island was under the sway of the Hindoos.

544 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The road to Wonosalem led through a magnificent forest, in the 
depths of which we passed a fine ruin of what appeared to have been 
a royal tomb or mausoleum. It is formed entirely of stone, and elabor- 
ately carved. Near the base is a course of boldly projecting blocks, 
sculptured in high relief, with a series of scenes which are probably in- 
cidents in the life of the defunct. These are all beautifully executed, 
some of the figures of animals in particular being easily, recognizable 
and very accurate. The general design, as far as the ruined state of 
the upper part will permit of its being seen, is very good, the effect be- 
ing given by an immense number and variety of projecting or retreat- 
ing courses of squared stones in place of mouldings. The size of the 
structure is about 30 feet square by 20 feet high, and as the traveler 
comes suddenly upon it on a small elevation by the road side, over- 
shadowed by gigantic trees, overrun with plants and creepers, and 
closely backed by the gloomy forest, he is struck by the solemnity and 
picturesque beauty of the scene, and is led to ponder on the strange 
law of progress, which looks so like retrogression, and which in so many 
distant parts of the world has exterminated or driven out a highly 
artistic and constructive race, to make room for one which, as far as we 
can judge is very far its inferior. The number and beauty of the archi- 
tectural remains in Java have never been popularly illustrated or de- 
scribed, and it will therefore take most people by surprise to learn that 
they far surpass those of Central America, perchance those, of India. 
To give some idea of these ruins, perhaps to excite wealthy amateurs 
to explore them thoroughly, and to obtain by photography on accurate 
record of these beautiful sculptures before it is too late, I will enum- 
erate the most important as briefly described in Sir Stauforus Baffle's 
History of Java. 

Near the center of Java, between the native capitals of Djoko-Kerta 
and Sura-Kerta, is the village of Brambanam, not far from which are 
abundance of ruins, the most important being the temples of Loro- 
Jongrau and Chandi Sewa. At Loro-Jongran there were separate 
buildings, six large, and fourteen small temples. They are now a 
mass of ruins, but the largest temple was supposed to have been 1)0 
feet high. They were all constructed of solid stone, everywhere 
decorated with carvings and bas-reliefs, and adorned with numbers 
of statues, many of which remain entire. At Chaudi-Sewa, or the 
" thousand temples," are many fine colossal figures. Captain Baker, 
who surveyed these ruins, said that he had never in his life seen 
such stupendous and finished specimens of human labor, and the 
science and taste of ages long since forgotten, crowded together in so 
small a compass as in this spot. They cover a span of nearly GOO feet 
square, and consist of an outer row of eighty-four temples; a second row 
of seventy-six j a third row of sixty-four; a fourth of forty-four; and a 
fifth forming an inner parallelogram of twenty-eight; in all two hun- 



TE PITO TE BENUA, OK EASTER ISLAND. 545 

died and ninety-sis small temples disposed iii live regular parallelo- 
grams. In the center is a large cruciform temple surrounded l>y forty 
flights of steps, richly ornamented with sculpture and containing many 

apartments. 

The tropical vegetation has mined most of the smaller temples, but 
some remain tolerably perfect, from which the effects of the whole may 
be imagined. About half a mile off is another temple, called Ghandi 
Kali Bening, Tl feet square and GO feet high, in line preservation, and 
covered with sculptures of Hindu mythology surpassing any that exists 
iu India. Other rums of palaces, halls and temples, with abundance of 
sculptured deities, are found in the same neighborhood. 

About so miles eastward, in the province of Kedu, is thegreat temple of 
Borobods. It is built upon a small hill, and consists of a central dome 
and seven ranges of terraced wall, covering the slope of » the hill, 
forming open galleries, each below the other, and communicating by 
steps and gateways. The central dome is 50 feet in diameter; around 
it is a triple circle of seventy-two towers; and the whole building is 020 
feet square and about 100 feet high. In the terraced walls are niches 
containing cross legged tigures larger than life, to the number of about 
four hundred; both sides of the terraced walls are covered with bas- 
reliefs crowded with tigures carved in hard stone, which must there- 
fore occupy an extent of nearly 3 miles in length. 

The amount of human labor and skill expended upon the great pyra- 
mids of Egypt, sink into insignificance when compared with that re- 
quired to complete this sculptured hill temple iu the interior of Java. 

About 40 miles southwest of Samarang, on a mountain called Junong 
I'rau, an extensive plateau is covered with ruins. To reach the temples, 
four flights of stone steps were made up to the mountain from opposite 
directions, each (light containing more than a thousand steps. Traces 
of nearly four hundred temples have been found here, and many (per- 
haps all) were decorated with rich and delicate sculptures. The whole 
country between this and Brambanam, a distance of 00 miles, abounds 
with ruins, so that fine sculptured tigures maybe seen lying in ditches, 
or built into the walls of Enclosures. 

In the eastern part of Java, at Kediri, and in Melang, there are 
equally abundant traces of antiquity, but the buildings themselves 
have been mostly destroyed ; sculptured figures, however, abound, and 
the ruins of forts, palaces, baths, aqueducts, and temples can be every- 
where t raced. 

fhe ruins of the ancient city of Majapahit cover miles of ground 
with paved roads, walls, tombs, and gateways, while sculptures of Hindu 
gods and goddesses of hard trachytie rock are found in the forests or 
/// situ in temples. Some of the buildings are of brick of curious con- 
struction; the bricks are lmined and built together without cement, 
and yet adhere incomprehensibly.

The natives reckoned their time, and in fact do so still by moons or 
months, commencing the year with August, which was, according to 
the traditions, the time when Hotu-Matua and his followers lauded upon 
the island. 

The following corresponds nearly to the English months set oppo- 
site:

The natives have recently divided the months into weeks, giving to 
the days the names of First day (Raa-potahi), Second day (Kaa-po-rua), 
Third day (Raa-po-toru), etc. The week is commenced on Mouday in 
order to bring the seventh day on Sunday. 

The mouth is divided into two equal portions, the first beginning 
with the new moon, and the second with the full moon. The calendar

The natives of Easter Island speak a dialect of the Malayo-Polynesian 
language, which is so widely spread in the South Sea and Malay Archi- 
pelago. Any one who will take the trouble to compare the accompany- 
ing vocabulary with the same words used by the natives of New Zea- 
land, Tahiti, Rorotonga, Samoa, and any of the islands of Polynesia, will 
see that mauy of the words are identically the same, and others show a 
slight variation. 

Not only do the words of this language resemble those spoken 
throughout the South Sea, but all the dialects possess, in common, the 



IE PITO TE HEM A, OF EASTER ISLAND. 



547 



peculiarity of having a dual number of tbe personal pronouns in addi- 
tion to tbe singular and plural. For example, be or sbe is, "Ko-ia," in 
the Maori it is, " ia ;" they two, on tbis island is " rana-a," in tbe Maori 
it is " rana ;*' they, in this dialect is " pouro," in tbe Maori, it is "ratou." 
Words are frequently reduplicated to denote tbe plural of collectives 
in nouns, the comparative, or superlative degree in adjectives, and re- 
peated action in verbs. "Iti" signifies little, " iti-iti," expresses very 
little, and tbe word for small child is " poki iti-iti." Food, or to eat, is 
" Kai," to eat much or heartily is expressed by u kai-kai." Tbe names 
of several of tbe colors are usually duplicated, as red, "inea-niea;" 
black, " uri-uri;" wbite "tea-tea;" veruiillion "ura-ura." 

An interesting feature of the language is tbe native name for pig, 
" Oru," wbicb differs from tbe corresponding term in all of tbe other 
Polynesian dialects. It is probably derived from tbe grunting sound 
made by tbe animal. In nearly all of tbe kindred dialects the name for 
pig is "puaka," a word wbicb is also applied by some of tbem to all 
quadrupeds except tbe rat. The Easter Islanders have given tbis name 
to cattle, calling a cow "puaka tamabine" (female puaka), and a bull 
" puaka tamaroa" (male puaka). Tbis tends to show that although 
pigs bad probably been introduced on tbe islands from wbicb tbe ances- 
tors of tbe present inhabitants came, tbey took none with tbem in their 
migration, and only preserved tbe word puaka in a vague sense, as sig- 
nifying a large animal with four legs. When cattle were introduced, 
tbey consequently applied tbe term to tbem, and coined tbe new one 
afterwards. 

Fingers are called " mauga-manga" and toes, " inangamanga vae," 
or literally the lingers of tbe foot. " Kiri " means covering, and to ex- 
press the wood shoe they say %i Kiri vae," or covering, for the foot. "Ivi" 
is the name applied to both needle and bone, which probably indicates 
that the original needles were made of bone. 

In the pronunciation of words of two syllables, the accent is on the 
first; in words of three syllables it is generally on the second, and in 
polysyllabic words it is on the penultimate. Modern articles recently 
introduced on the island are called by their English names, or some- 
thing that has a similar sound. 

It is worthy of note that the word "Atua" is used to signify both 
god and devil.

ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING-A STUDY BASED ON MATERIAL IN THE 

I, S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



By Otis T. Mason, 
Curator of tin- Department of Ethnology. 



INTRODUCTION. 

Consider for a moment all the industries included within the word 
"leather." It involves everything done to the hides of animals from 
the moment they are taken oft' by the butcher until they are manufact- 
ured ami ready to be sold to the consumer. It is important to enter 
somewhat into detail at this point before describing the skin-working 
apparatus of the American aborigines, so as to bring into a congenital 
relationship the earliest and the latest manifestation of a great series of 
industries. 

The hides of cattle, sheep, goafs, horses, dogs, and indeed of all do- 
mestic animals, the peltries of all wild animals that are of any use what- 
ever to man. are gathered up in a kind of civilized or wild harvest, as 
the case may he. by butchers, trappers, hunters, etc., and sent to the 
tannery or to the manipulators answering to this trade. 

Here commences a diversity of treatment, ending in the preparation 
of the hide with the hair remaining, by the furrier; in the production 
of a soft leather by a process called tawing; or in the manufacture of 
true leather by the use of tannin in some form. We have done now 
with the secondary industries. 

The products of the leather factories are taken up and prepared for 
consumption by harness-makers, shoe-makers, glove-makers, satchel- 
makers, embossers, book-binders, carriage-makers, armorers, machinists, 
musical-instrument-makers, taxidermists, and the like, and passed on 
through the great Briareus of commerce to those who will destroy 
them in use. 

After fully realizing this immense body of industries, we are in a 
position to appreciate one or two facts respecting savagery, to wit, how 
Largely the products of the skins of animals entered into the activity of 
primitive men ; how necessary it is, in order to reconstruct that civili- 
zation, to know what modern savages do with these same suhsl ances, 
and anally to collect the tools and observe the processes of aboriginal 



554 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

peoples working at this series of trades in order to know the life-history 
of a great human occupation. 

The first artisans of this craft were, for the most part, women, who, 
indeed, were the inventors and fostering patrons of all these simple 
arts which lay at the foundation of most of our modern peaceful indus- 
tries. 

Let us follow the savage woman through her daily cares in order that 
we may comprehend the significance of her part in the play. The slain 
deer lying before her cave or brush shelter, or wigwam, shall be the 
point of departure in the inquiry. . She strikes off a sharp flint flake 
for a knife. By that act she becomes the first cutler, the real founder 
of Sheffield. With this knife she carefully removes the skin, little 
dreaming that she is thereby making herself the patron saint of all sub- 
sequent butchers. She rolls up the hide, then dresses it with brains, 
smokes it, curries it, breaks it with implements of stone and bone, with 
much toil and sweat, until she establishes her reputation as the first 
currier and tanner. With fingers weary and worn, with needle of bone 
and thread of sinew, and scissors of flint, she cuts and makes the cloth- 
ing for her lord and her family ; no sign is over the door, but within 
dwells the first tailor and dress-maker. From leather especially pre- 
pared she manufactures moccasins for her husband, which to his speed 
adds wings. Compared with the tardy progress of her barefooted man 
in the chase, they are indeed the winged sandals of Hermes, and she is the 
aboriginal St. Crispin. Out of little scraps of fur and feathers, supple- 
mented with bits of colored shell or stone or seeds, she dresses dolls for 
her children, makes head-dresses and toggery for the coming dance, 
adorns the walls of her squalid dwelling, creating at a single pass half 
a dozen modern industries— at once, toy-maker, milliner, modiste, 
hatter, upholsterer, and wall-decker. 

In order to comprehend the steps in the processes of the aboriginal 
tanner it may be serviceable to take a hurried glance through a mod- 
ern tannery. The methods of procedure are somewhat as follows : 

(1) Salted or dried hides are soaked to make them pliable, washed, 
and the extraneous flesh taken off with a flesher, an instrument like a 
drawiug knife, sharp on one edge and dull and smooth on the other. 
Market hides are soaked in fresh water to remove blood and dirt. 

(2) The cleaned hides are then placed for a few days in a vat of lime 
water, which opens the pores, loosens the hair and combines with the 
oily matter in the hide to form a soap. Putrefaction softening is also 
resorted to for removal of the hair. 

(3) The hides are then rubbed down with the smooth side of the 
flesher, the hair removed, and the skin made as pure and clean as it can 
be. They are at the same time rendered porous for the reception of the 
tannin. 

(4) They are then hung in a series of tan-pits, in which the water is 
more and more charged with tannic acid until the hide is converted 
into leather. 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING. 555 

(5) After rinsing, the hides are subjected to scouring in a machine 
by which one man can go over a hundred a day. But the interesting 
part remains that Turkey-stone is still the only substance that will do 
the work. The whole operation at this point is no more than a savage 
process, except that machinery is used to move the stone. 

(d>) The subsequent processes of drying, oiling, sweating, and press- 
ing are varied with the uses of the leather. The genius of the inventor 
has been invoked to substitute machinery for these simple hand proc- 
esses. After all the problems are the same, to remove the hair with- 
out impairing the hide, to introduce some antiseptic substance within 
the texture, to break up the fibrous tissue, and to render it pliable as 
possible. The subsequent processes of dyeing and preparing for spe- 
cial uses involve all the accretions of civilization, and produce the com- 
plexity of the more highly organized processes. 

ANIMALS WHOSE SKINS ARE UTILIZED BY AMERICAN ABORIGINES. 

It will help us in getting an adequate conception of the amount of 
work on pel tries by our aborigines to consider for a moment the great 
number and variety of animals whose skins were necessary to their 
happiness. The mention of savage skiu-working usually recalls the 
seal, elk, reindeer, musk-ox, buffalo, bear, deer, beaver, and fox, but a 
moment spent in examining the species of mammals which the fastidi- 
ous taste of an Esquimo woman demands before her wardrobe is com- 
pleted will enlarge one's knowledge. 

In order to properly estimate the industry under consideration, a 
list of the animals whose skins are known to have been used by our 
aborigines is appended.

SKIN-DRESSING AMONG THE ESKIMO. 

For the purpose of approaching this industry in its earliest and least 
complex state a tew quotations from early travelers and explorers are 
introduced. Grantz, in the history of Greenland (p. 1 67), speaks as 
follows : 

"For their 'kapitck,' or hairy seal-skin clothes, they scrape the seal- 
skin thin, lay it twenty-four hours in the 'korbik,' or urine tub, to ex- 
tract the fat or oil, and then distend it for drying with pegs on a green 
place. Afterwards, when they work the skin, it is sprinkled with 
urine, rubbed with pumice-stone, and suppled by rubbing between the 
hands. 

."(2) The sole leather is soaked two or three days in a urine tub; 
then they pull off the loosened hair with a knife or with their teeth, lay 
it three days in fresh water, and so stretch it for drying. 

u (3) In the same manner they prepare the ' eresak ' leather that they 
use for the legs of boots and the overleather of shoes, only that it is 
scraped very thin to make it pliable. Of this leather they also make 
the sea-coats which the men draw over their other clothes to keep out 
the wet when they go to sea. It is true it grows as soft and wet as a 
dish-cloth by the salt water and rain, but it keeps the wet from the 
undergarments. 

"(4) In the same manner they dress the ' erogak,' of which they make 
their smooth black pelts to wear on shore, only in working it they rub 
it between their hands; therefore it is not so stiff as the foregoing, but 
loses the property of holding out water and is not fit for boots and sea- 
coats. 

"(5) The boat-skins are selected out of the stoutest seal hides, from 
which the fat is not quite taken off. They roll them up and sit on them 
and let them lie in the sun covered with grass several weeks till the 
hair will come off. Then they lay them in the salt water for some days 
to soften them again. They draw the borders of the skins tight with 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING. 561 

their teeth, sew them together, ami smear the seams ami stitches with 
old seal blubber instead of pitch, that the water may not penetrate. 
But they must take care not to impair the grain, for if they do the cor- 
roding sea-water will easily eat through the leather. 

"(6) The remnants of this and the other sorts they shave thin, lay 
them upon the snow or hang them in the air to bleach them white, and 
if they intend to dye it red chew the leather with some bark of the 
roots of pine, which they gather up out of the sea, working it in with 
their teeth. 

(7) They soften the skin of the fowls about the head and then draw 
it off whole over the body. The processes of tanning, Hall says, are 
first to scrape the skin by an instrument called Sek-koon (by the 
Frobisher Bay Inuuits, Teg-se-koon). (Plates LXX, LXXI.) 

This instrument is about iuches long, including the handle, and is 
made of a peculiar kind of whet or oil stone, or else of musk-ox or rein- 
deer bone or of sheet-iron. The second step is to dry the skins thor- 
oughly ; the third, to scrape again with the sek-koon, taking off every 
bit of the flesh ; the fourth, to wet the flesh side and wrap it up for 
thirty minutes, and then again scrape with the sek-koon, which last 
operation is followed by chewing the skin all over, and again scraping 
and cross scraping with the instrument. These laborious processes 
Hall describes as resulting " in the breaking of the skin, making the 
stiff hide soft, finished like the chamois skin." The whole work is often 
completed within an hour. (Narrative of the Second Expedition made 
by C. F. Hall, pp. 01,1)2.) 

"In Cumberland Sound," says Kumlien, '-when a seal skin is about 
to be prepared for drying the blubber is first removed somewhat 
roughly, the skin then laid on a board, and with the woman's knife the 
membrane underneath the blubber is separated from the skin. The 
knife must be very sharp to do this successfully. The operators always 
push the Unite from them. It takes considerable experience to do the 
job well. When all the blubber is removed, which will take three or 
four hours of faithful work, the skin is taken outside, and by means of 
the feet is roiled and rubbed around in the snow for some time, and by 
this process they sneered in removing every trace of grease from the 
hair. When thoroughly washed the skin is put upon the stretchers, if 
it be winter, to dry; these stretchers are merely four poles, which are 
lashed together at the corners, like a quilt-frame, the proper distance 
apart to suit the size of the skin. The skin is secured in place by seal- 
skin thongs passed through little slits along its edges and made fast to 
the poles. 

When the skin is properly stretched upon the frame >t is put above 
the lamps inside the snow-hut to dry. As the sun gets higher and 
begins to lmve some effect the skins are stretched, flesh side up, on 
the southern slopes of snow banks, and are secured by means of wooden 
or bone pegs about a foot in length. 

H. Mis. 224, pt.2 ;;<; 



562 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

As ilie season advances and the snow melts they begin to stretch 
the skins upon the ground by means of the before-mentioned pegs. 
The shins are not allowed to rest upon the ground, but are raised a few 
inches to allow the air to circulate underneath. Skins dry very fast 
when exposed in this manner. 

The first days of spring are always a busy time with the Eskimo 
women. One thing is, they get more freshly-killed skins to prepare, 
and then they generally have a surplus stock of the winter's catch, 
which they could not take care of by the slow process of drying over 
the lamps in the huts during winter. The skins of the young in the 
white coats are dried in some considerable quantities, as it takes about 
fifteen to make a single suit of clothes, and many of them have double 
suits made from this material. They have no idea of any tan, and 
prepare the skins by merely rubbing them with their skin-scrapers. 

We insert a sketch of a very old skin-scraper, such as are now found 
only in the old graves (Plate lxx, Fig. 3). It is made of stone, with a 
wooden handle, which is fastened to the stone by means of a strip of 
whalebone. Another and a later pattern is made from the scapula of 
the reindeer. A better idea of its manufacture can be got from the 
sketch than by a description. Such scrapers are still in use, but serve 
as a sort of auxiliary to one made from a tin can, resembling a little 
scoop in shape and having a wooden handle. This is the style of scraper 
made at the present day, and is by far the most effective instrument of 
the three. The manner of using these scrapers is to take the skin 
firmly in the left hand, to put the knee or foot upon the extreme 
part of it, holding it securely, while the scraper is worked with the 
right hand, pushing downward with some force. If the skins are 
very dry when they begin they are somewhat softened by rubbing with 
the hands, or even chewing the most stubborn parts. They continue 
using these tools upon a hide till it gains the desired pliability. All 
the work of stretching, drying, cleaning, washing, and softening the 
skins falls on the women. 

" The skins of Phoca barbata are stretched on a frame like those of the 
netstick, but not until the hair has been removed. The cutting of the 
hair is one of the nastiest aud most disgusting sights one can imagine. 
It generally falls to tlie lot of some old woman to do this. The skins are 
allowed to lie and become somewhat putrid, a portion of the blubber 
remaining on. The only tool used is the woman's knife before men- 
tioned. When about to clean one of these skins the squaw takes off 
her boots, stockings, and pantaloons, and tucking her feet under her 
body, lays this dirty, bloody, greasy, stinking skin on her bare thigh, 
the flesh side down. She then pushes the knife against the hair, cut- 
ting or rather shaving it off. As her hand becomes too oily to hold on 
to the skin, she puts her fingers into her mouth and thus cleans them. 
When properly cleaned, it is dried in the manner already spoken of, ex- 
cept that the back aud belly of the auimal are dried separately, as the 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING 563 

skin is different on those portions of the body, and would euro unevenly. 
When finished it is almost as stiff and dry as a board. This, skin is used 
mainly for the soles of boots; the pattern is ear from the hide and then 
chewed till it becomes sufficiently soft to sew. This last operation is 
also mainly performed by the old squaws. When they are too old to 
sew they become oojook chewersas the last resort, and when their teeth 
fail them they are better off in the grave." (Ludwig Kumlien. Bull. 
National Museum, No. 15.) 

Amongst the ( Sentral Eskimo, says Dr. Fran/. Boas, the latest author- 
ity, the skin of the seal [Phoca, foetida) is dressed in different ways 
according to the purpose for which it is intended. In skinning the 
animal a longitudinal cut is made across the belly with a common luitch- 
er's knife or one of ancient pattern (An. Rep. Bur. Ethnol VI., Fig. 
160). The skin, with the blubber, is cut from the flesh with the same 
knife. The flippers are cur off at the points, and thus the whole skin is 
drawn off in a single piece. The woman's knife, ulo is used to clean and 
prepare theskins [id. Fig. 461), in which operation the women spread 
the skin over a piece of whalebone (Asimautang), a small board, or 
flat stone, and sit down before it, resting on their knees, the feet bent 
under the thighs. They hold the skin by the nearest edge, and push- 
ing the ulo forward, remove the blubber and deposit it in a small tub, 
which stands near the board. As they proceed to the opposite end of 
the skin the finished part is rolled up and held in the left hand. 

If the skin is to be used with the hair on it. the tough membrane 
[mami) which covers the inner side is removed in the same way as the 
blubber, and after it has been carefully patched and the holes have 
been cut all round the edge, it is stretched over a gravelly place or on " 
snow by means of long pegs (paukton), which holdita few inches above 
the ground, thus allowing the air to circulate underneath it. The skin 
itself is washed and rubbed with gravel, snow, or ice, and every hole 
made by the bullet or by the spear or in preparing it is sewed up. It 
very seldom happens that the women in preparing it damage the skin 
or even the thin mammae, it is particularly difficult to split the skin 
near a hole. First, they finish the work all around it and then carefully 
sever the membrane at its edge. The skin is dried in the same way as 
tin- membrane. In the early part of spring, though it may still be very 
cold, a few choice young seal skins are dried on snow walls which fare 
i he south. In order thoroughly to dry a seal skin, one tine warm spring 
day is needed. If the Eskimos are greatly in need of skins they dry 
them in winter over the lamps. A frame is made of four poles, lashed 
together, according to the size of the skin. A thong passes through the 
slits along its edge and around the frame, keeping the skin well stretched. 
Thus it is placed over the lamps or near the root' of the hut. However, 
it is disagreeable work to dry the skins inside the huts, and as they are 
much inferior to those which are dried on the ground, the Eskimos 
avoid it if they can. When so prepared the seal skins are only tit for 



564 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



covering tents, making bags, etc. ; they are too hard to be used for 
clothing, for which purpose the skin of yearlings is almost exclusively 
employed. 

The young seals having shed for the first time have a very handsome 
coat, the hair being of a fine texture and much longer than in older ani- 
mals. From the middle of May until late in summer their skins are 
most suitable for the manufacture of summer clothing, but it is neces- 
sary to protect the carcass of the killed animals from the burning rays 
of the sun as soon as possible, or the skin will be quickly spoiled. 

After being dried tbey are cleaned with a sharp scraper (teserqun) 
(Boas, Figs. 465, 466). The skin is then soaked in salt water and washed 
again. As soon as it is dry it is softened with a straight scraper 
(seligoung) (Boas, An. Rep. Bur. Ethnol., vi, Fig. 468). 

Skins of Phoca fcetida, Cystophora cristata, and Phoca groenlandica are 
prepared in the same way. 

Those that are intended for kayak covers, boots, mittens, quivers, etc., 
are prepared in a different way. They are either put into hot water or 
laid in a brook for a few days until the hair begins to loosen. Then 
both sides are cleaned and worked with the ulo, in order to clean and 
shave them. When the hair has been removed they are dried and made 
pliable in the same way as has been described. If it is intended to make 
the skin as soft as possible, it is allowed to become putrid before it is 
cleaned. Then the hair and blubber are removed, and afterwards it is 
left to hang in the sun a few days until it acquires a light color. 

The large ground seal Erignathus barbatus is skinned in a different 
manner. Its skin is very thick, even thicker than sole-leather, and is 
extremely durable, and suitable for all sorts of lines, particularly traces, 
lashing and harpoon lines, and for soles, drinking cups, and boat covers. 
The skin of the back and of the breast dries unequally, and therefore a 
piece covering the throat and breast is taken out and dried separately. 
If it is to be used for lines, it is cut by making girdles about 6 inches in 
width around the body. The hair and blubber are removed from these 
cylindrical rings, from which lines are made by cutting spirally, a 
string 70 or 80 feet long being 1 thus obtained. 

This line is stretched as taut as possible between two rocks, and 
while drying it undergoes an enormous tension. Before it is taken 
from the rocks the edges are rounded and cleaned with a knife. 

Walrus hide is always cut up before being prepared. As soon as the 
walrus is killed it is cut into as many parts as there are partners in the 
hunt, every part being rolled up in a piece of skin and carried home in 
it. Sometimes the skin is used for making boats, but generally it is 
cut into lines. Both kinds of hide, that of the walrus and that of the 
ground seal, are as stiff as a board when dried and require much work 
before being fit for use. They are chewed by the natives until they 
become thin and pliable. The whole skin must be chewed in this way 
before it can be used for soles and boat covers. A fterwards it is scraped 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSIN< i, 565 

with the tesirqun and softened with the straight scraper. The new 
thongs after being dried between the rocks must be also chewed until 
they become sufficiently pliable, after which they are straightened by a 
tretcher that is held with the feet (Boas, Fig. 4G9.) Frequently they are 
only pulled over the sole of the boot for this purpose, the man taking 
hold of the line at two points and pulling the intermediate part by 
turns to the right aud to the left over the sole of the foot. 

Another kind of line is cut from the hide of the white whale, which 
is skinned in the same way as the ground seal: but, as.it must be slit 
on the spinal column, the single pieces of line are much shorter, and 
they can not be used to the same extent as seal lines. Some lines are 
cut from the skins of Pagomys fcetidus, but these are weak and greatly 
inferior to lines of ground-seal hide. 

Deer skins are dried in summer and dressed after the ice has formed. 
Like all other kind of skins, they are not tanned, but curried. They 
are hung up on the rafters of the hut, aud the workers in Oqo and 
Akudnirn, the women — in Hudson Bay the men — take off their jackets 
and begin preparing them with the sharp scraper. After being cleaned 
in this way they are thoroughly dried, either by hanging them near the 
roof of the hut, or according to Gilder, by wrapping them around the 
upper part of the body next to the skin, after which they are again 
scraped with the tesirqun. This done the flesh side is wetted, the skin 
is wrapped up for half a day or a day, and afterwards undergoes a 
new scraping. Then it is chewed, rubbed, and scraped all over, thus ac- 
quiring its pliability, softness, and light color. In the spring theskinof 
bears and of seals are sometimes dried on large frames which are ex- 
posed to the sun, the skins being tied to the frames with thongs. Smaller 
quadrupeds, as foxes and ermines, are skinned by stripping the entire 
animal through its mouth without making a single cut in the skin. 
Birds are opened at the breast, and the body is taken out through this 
small hole; the head, wings, aud legs being cut off at the neck and the 
joints. Ducks are frequently skinned by cutting the skin around the 
head and the outer joints of the wings and legs, and stripping it off. 
The skins are cleaned by sucking out the fat and chewing them. 

Skins of salmon are used for water-proof bags, intestines of seals, par- 
ticularly those of ground seals, are carefully dried, and after being sewed 
together are used for sails, windows, and kyak jackets. 

The Malemut Eskimo tan and soften the seal skin used for boot-soles 
in urine (Whimper, Tr. Ethnol. Soc. L868). For making kyaks and 
umiaks seal skins are used. The skin is prepared in the first instance, 
while the hair is yet on it, by spreading fermented fish -spawn over it, 
and allowing it to remain until the hair rots off. It is then stretched 
on a frame and saturated with urine until it becomes translucent. The 
fat is removed with bone and stone knives, metal being considered 
likely to cut it. (Whimper, Alaska" 1G2.) 



566 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The hide scraper of the Chukchis is of stone or iron, and fastened to 
a wooden handle, and looks like a spokeshave. It is, indeed, the lineal 
descendant of the bone scraper. With this tool the moistened hide is 
cleaned very particularly, and is then rubbed, stretched, and kneaded 
so carefully, that several days go to the preparation of a single reindeer 
skin. That this is hard work is also shown by the woman who is em- 
ployed at it in the tent dripping with perspiration. While thus em- 
ployed she sits on a part of the skin and stretches out the other part 
with the united help of the hands and bare feet. When the skin has 
been sufficiently worked she fills a vessel with her own urine, mixes 
this with comminuted willow bark which has been dried over the lamp, 
and rnbs the blood- warm liquid into the reindeer skin. In order to 
give this a red color on one side the bark of a species of Pinus (?) is 
mixed with the tanning liquid. The skins are made very soft by this 
process, and on the inner side almost resemble chamois leather. Some- 
times, too, the reindeer skin is tanned to real chamois of very excellent 
quality.* 

The Tuski understand the art of tanning and are able to produce 
very fair specimens, but practice it principally with seal skin, which is 
dressed in all colors. The white is very delicate and much prized. 
Deer skins are dressed with ammonia, red ocher and other materials. 
They are rendered very soft and pliable (W. H. Hooper, p. 183). 
This description answers perfectly to the work done on the reindeer 
hide, both with and without the hair, by the Indians and Eskimo <>l 
Uugava, Canada. 

A large collection of those brought by Lucien Turner will be found 
in the National Museum. The softness of the texture is marvelous. 
Not one particle of rigid fiber seems to have been left in the skin. 
In order to effect this perfect flexibility the statement of Norden- 
skjold is not overrated. Indeed, those who have seen some of the best 
of the wigwams made of buffalo hide depilated will recall the soft- 
ness and pliability effected in this refractory material by the applica- 
tion of human muscle, which after all is the chief ingredient in abo- 
riginal tanning. 

CHAPTER III. 

SKIN DRESSING AMONG THE INDIANS. 

The skin-working apparatus of the Naskopi Indians is described by 
Lucien Turner. 

This instrument is one of the few really labor-saving tools of the 
poorly equipped Naskopi; and is particularly effective in removing the 
hair from the hides of various mammals or the fat from the flesh side 
of the skins. The skin is removed from the beast and laid aside until 
a convenient time arrives for preparing it for its intended uses. The 



Nordeuskjokl, Voyage of the Vega, New York, 1882, Macmillau, 486, Fig. 1. 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING. 567 

time depends on the season of the year ; for if it be in the height of the 
deer-killing the poor squaw has her hands full of labor, since she must 
not only remove the skins from the carcasses, but prepare the flesh for 
drying, smoking, or other manner of preserving it for the future. To 
these labors are to be added the other domestic duties which fully oc- 
cupy the shortening days of the year, and often cause her to express a 
wish that the deer were less plentiful for the time being. When a num- 
ber of reindeer skins have been collected they are wetted and thrown 
into a pile, where they are allowed to decompose or ferment until the 
hair is loosened in its follicle. The process may be inspected from time 
to time, and when advanced to a proper state a skin is taken from the 
heap to undergo the act of depilation, which is effected in the following 
manner. (Plate LXVII, Fig. 1.) 

The radius or large bone of the fore-leg of the reindeer is cleaned of 
its flesh and one side of the shaft or central portion of the bone is re- 
moved, leaving two sharp edges. One ei\ge is dull or rounded for rea- 
sons which will appear clear in the manner of using the scraper. The 
other or outer side (for the instrument is to be held in a certain way) is 
rendered sharp, so as to form an edge, but not so keen as to cut the pelt. 
The skin is now placed upon a ahott beam of wood about .'> or 4 inches 
in diameter and long enough to reach obliquely from the abdomen of 
the standing person to the ground at a convenient distance, say 4 feet 
in length. Over this beam the skin is laid with the hinder part of the 
skin towards the person, so as to allow the edge of the scraper to work 
against the layer of hair. The scraper is now seized with one end in 
each hand and applied to the portion of the skin lying in contact with 
the beam. A skilful push dislodges the hair, and the skin appears clean 
and free from hair wherever the edge of the boue has scraped its sur- 
face. The process continues until each part of the skin is brought un- 
der the edge of the scraper and the work is complete. This instrument 
is also employed to remove the excess of water from a skin that has 
been wetted to bring it into the degree of pliability desired. It is em- 
ployed in the same manner to remove the scurf from the skins of the 
white whales ( Delphinaptenis calodoti), captured in goodly numbers each 
year near Fort Chimo. (I must here add that the Whale River (Fort 
George) Indians perforin this labor, as the Naskopis consider the whale 
too oily a creature for them to work, ft only proves that the employ- 
ment of this instrument is not confined to the Naskopi Indians.) 

If should be understood that this form of aboriginal beaming-knife is 
employed for removing the hair from reindeer skins that are to be con- 
verted into parchment (raw hide) or into buckskin. It is to be remarked 
that the scraper is used only after the flesh side of the skin has received 
attention. The flesh side requires another form of instrument to effect 
the removal of the skin-muscles, ligaments, and adherent fat. An in- 
strument is especially made for removing that part. The heel bone of 
the reindeer is cut very obliquely at the lower end, so that the Hat edge

iuay form a blade, which is ground sharp and then finely serrated. A 
strap-like loop is tied around the bone, and when the tool, which is adze 
and chisel combined, is grasped, the hand is preveuted from slipping 
along the bone by the loop passing under the wrist and supporting the 
hand. The adherent muscle is quickly separated from the skin and 
forms a sort of vellum, which may be dried and serve as wrappers for 
bundles of furs or dry meat. The fleshy side of the skin is rubbed with 
a mixture of decomposed brains and liver and laid away for several 
hours. The process of rubbing is next resorted to, resembling the act 
of rubbing linen in the laundry between the hands. When the desired 
pliability is gained, the superabundant fat and moisture are removed 
by calcareous earths, bone dust, or flour, to act as absorbents. The skins 
are now ready for any purpose. (Plate LXVIII, Figs. 1, 2, 3.) 

Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U. S. Navy, says that the Chilkat women pro- 
cure the hair of the Rocky Mountain goat for their sacred blankets by 
rolling up the hide until it sweats and the pores are opened. A woman 
then sits on the ground, lays the skin on her lap, and with her hands 
scrapes off the hair in great flakes, without the use of a beaming-knife 
of any kind. This, of course, is the simplest form of depilation. The 
next is that practiced by the Indians of northern California, who em. 
ploy a rib of the elk, without any modification whatever. 

The manner of preparing buckskin by the Nisqually and Columbia 
River Indians is as follows: Immediately after the animal is killed the 
skin, having all the hair scraped off, is stretched tight on a frame. It is 
there left until it becomes as dry as parchment, then it is rubbed over 
with the brains of the animal, which impart oil to it. It is then steeped 
in warm water and dried in the smoke, two women stretching it all the 
time it is drying. It is then again wet and wound tightly around a 
tree, from which it is again taken, smoked, and drawn by the women as 
before. When nearly dry it is rubbed with the hands, as in washing, 
until it is soft and pliable, and then it is ready for use. 

Mr. Forest stated to me that he had put on a suit twenty-four hours 
after the animal had been running in the forest. (Wilkes.) 

The Crows, like theBlackfeet, are beautifully costumed, and perhaps 
with somewhat more of taste and elegance, inasmuch as the skins of 
which their dresses are made are more delicately and whitely dressed. 
The art of dressing skins belongs to the Indians in all countries; and 
the Crows surpass the civilized world in the beauty of their skin-dress- 
ing. The art of tanning is unknown to them, when civilized habits 
and arts have not been taught them ; yet the art of dressing skins, 
as we have it in the civilized world, has been (like hundreds of other 
ornamental and useful customs which we are practicing) borrowed from 
the savage without our ever stopping to inquire whence they come 
or by whom invented. 

The usual mode of dressing the buffalo and other skins is by im- 
mersing them for a few days under a lye from ashes and water until

the bair can be removed, when they are Stretched upon a frame or upon 
the ground with stakes or pins driven through the edges into the earth, 
where they remain for several days, with the brains of the buffalo or 
elk spread upon and over them, and at last finished by " graining," as 
it is termed by the squaws, who use a sharpened bone, the shoulder- 
blade, or other large bone of the animal, sharpened at the edge some- 
what like an adze, with the edge of which they scrape the fleshy side 
of the skin, bearing on it with the weight of their bodies, thereby 
drying and softening the skin and fitting it for use. (Plate XCI.) 

The greater part of these skins, however, go through still another 
operation afterwards, which gives them a greater value and renders 
them much more serviceable — that is, the process of smoking. For 
this a small hole is dug in the ground, and a fire is built in it with rot- 
ten wood, which will produce a great quantity of smoke without much 
blaze, and several small poles of the proper length stuck in the ground 
around it, drawn and fastened together at the top, around which a skin 
is wrapped in form of a tent, generally sewed together at the edges to 
secure the smoke within it. In this the skins to be smoked are placed, 
and in this condition the tent will stand a day or two inclosing the 
heated smoke, and by some chemical process or other which I do not 
understand the skins acquire a quality which enables them, after being 
wet many times, to dry soft and pliant as they were before, which secret 
I have never yet seen practiced in my own country, and for the lack of 
which all of our dressed skins, when once wet, are, I think, chiefly ruined. 

An Indian's dress of deer skins, which is wet a hundred times upon 
his back, dries soft; and his lodge also, which stands in the rains and 
even through the severity of winter,. is taken down as soft and as clean 
as when it was first put up. 

A Crow is known wherever he is met by his beautiful white dress and 
his tall and elegant figure, the greater part of the men being G feet 
high. The Blackfeet, on the other hand, are more of the herculean 
make, about middling stature, with broad shoulders and great expan- 
sion of chest, and the skins of which their dresses are made are chiefly 
dressed black or of a dark-brown color, from which circumstance, in all 
probability they — having black leggins or moccasins — have got the name 
of Blackfeet. (Catlin's Eight Years, pp. 4G-47, vol. 1.) 

Among the Sioux the hides were stretched and dried as soon as possi- 
ble after they were taken from the animals. When a hide was stretched 
on the ground pins were driven through holes along the borders of the 
hide. These holes had been cut with a knife. While the hide was still 
green the women scraped it on the under side by pushing a webajabe 
over its surface, thus removing the superfluous flesh, etc. The webajabe 
was formed from the lower bone of an elk's leg, which had been made 
thin by scraping or striking. The lower end was sharpened by striking, 
having several teeth-like projections, as in the accompanying figure. 
A withe was tied to the upper end, and this was secured to the arm of 



570 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

the woman just above the wrist. When the hide was dry the woman 
stretched it again upon the ground, aud proceeded to make it thinner 
and lighter by using another implement called the weubaja, which she 
moved towards her after the manner of an adze. This instrument was 
formed from an elk horn, to the lower end of which was fastened a piece 
of iron (in recent times) called the weu-hi. (Plates XC and XCI.) 

When the hide was needed for a summer tent, leggius, or summer 
clothing of any sort, the weubaja was applied to the hairy side. When 
the hide was sufficiently smooth grease was rubbed on it, and it was laid 
out-of-doors to dry in the sun. This act of greasing the hide was 
called wawexigxi, because they sometimes used the brains of the elk or 
buffalo for that purpose. 

Dougherty stated that in his day they used to spread over the hide 
the brains or liver of the animal, which had been carefully retained 
for that purpose, and the warm broth of the meat was also poured over 
it. Some persons made two-thirds of the brain of an animal suffice for 
dressing its skin. But Prank La Fleche says that the liver was not 
used for tanning purposes, though the broth was so used when it was 
brackish. 

When the hide had been dried in the sun it was soaked by sinking 
it beneath the surface of any adjacent stream. This act lasted about 
two days. Then the hide was dried again and subjected to the final 
operation, which was intended to make it. sufficiently soft and pliant. 
A twisted sinew about as thick as one's finger, called the " wexikinde," 
was fastened at each end to a post or a tree about 5 feet from the 
ground. The hide was put through this aud pulled back and forth. 
This act was called waxikmde. On the commencement of this process, 
called ta"pe, the hides were almost invariably divided longitudinally 
into two parts each, for the convenience of the operator. When finished 
they were again sewed together with awls and sinews. When the hides 
were small thev were not so divided before they were tanned. 

The skins of elk, deer, and antelopes were dressed in a similar 
manner. (J. O. Dorsey, An. Kept. Bur. Ethnol. 1881-'82, p. 310.) 

Dressing skins by the Sioux Indians is thus described by a noted 
traveler: "They had killed a large elk, the skin of which the women 
were employed in dressing. They had stretched it out by means of 
leather straps on the ground near the tent, and the women were scrap- 
ing off the particles of flesh and fat with a well-contrived instrument 
made of bone, sharpened at one end, and furnished with little teeth 
like a saw, and at the other end a strap, which is fastened around the 
waist. The skin is scraped with the sharp edge of this instrument 
until it is perfectly clean. Several Indians have iron teeth fixed to 
this bone." (Maximilian's Travels.) 

Again : " We looked at the women as they worked ; for the shoes 
they made they had softened the leather in a tub of water and 
stretched it in the breadth and length with their teeth. In another 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING. 571 

tent the women were dressing skins, either witli a pnraice-stone or with 
the toothed instrument described before. They then pulled the skin 
over a line in all directions to make it pliable." (Maximilian, p. 158.) 

Among tho Kiowa Indians those skins taken are mostly dressed for 
lodges. They are first staked on a smooth spot of ground and water 
put upon them, when they are ready for fleshing. This consists in re- 
moving the flesh with an instrument made of a straight bar o( iron, 
alHMit a foot in length, flattened at one end and filed to the edge. This 
being grasped in the hand, and a succession of quick blows given, the 
work slowly proceeds. The skin is then dried, after which the hair is 
removed in a dry state, and the skin reduced to the proper thickness by 
dressing down on the hair side. This is done with an instrument made 
by firmly tying a flat piece of steel, filed to a beveled edge at one end 
and with the corners rounded, to a large prong of a deer's horn. This 
is so trimmed, in connection with the body of the horn, as to form an 
elbow, and is used a little as a carpenter uses his adze. This work is 
usually done in the cool of the morning. The brains of the animal, 
having been properly taken care of for the purpose, are now soaked 
and sqeezed by the hand until reduced to a paste and applied to both 
sides of the skin, which is afterwards worked and rubbed until flexible. 

The preparation of robes is from winter skins, and differs from the 
foregoing only in being dressed down on the flesh side, so as to leave 
the wool and hair upon the robe, and is more thoroughly worked and 
scoured by means of a sharp gritted stone. (Thomas 0. Battey. A 
Quarter of a Century among the Indians, 1S75, pp. 187-18S.) 

The Pitt River Indians and the Modocs tan their leather by nearly 
1 he same process. When an Indian wants buckskin for clothes, imme 
diately after skinning a deer he cuts its head open, procures the brains, 
spreads the skin on a smooth log with the bark off. The flesh side 
of the skin being up, he rubs the brains over it and allows'it to 
dry. This makes the hide not only grain easier, but half tans it. 
The skin is then thrown into the stream, where it is allowed to re- 
main three or four days. This raises the grain. It is then thrown 
across a slick smooth piece of log about 10 or 12 inches in diameter. 
One end of this stick is usually about 3 feet off of the ground and the 
other end resting on the ground. The neck of the skin is now pulled 
(> or 8 inches over the elevated end of the graining log, and the 
stomach of the grainer pressed tightly against it. A flat stick is usually 
placed between the stomach and the skin. This enables the workman 
to hold the skin from slipping. He has what is known as a graining 
knife. This knife is now made of iron, but was not long since made of 
hard yew wood. It is from one-fourth to three-eighths of an inch thick, 
by L' to .'* inches wide. It is curved edgewise to fit the round surface 
of the graining-log. The edge is perfectly square. There is a handle 
at each end, and the knife is taken by each handle and pushed vigor- 
ously down the skin. This is rather slow work; still, an Indian will 



572 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889 

grain twelve or fifteen skins in a day. After a skin is grained it is 
thrown into a basket of water. This water has a lot of roots cut up in 
it that causes the water to lather like soap. In fact it is called soap- 
root, and is used not only for tanning, but for washing clothes, etc. 
The hide is allowed to remain in this soapy water from three to four 
days. It is then taken out and rubbed and pulled dry. This completes 
the tanning of a skin. If, though, it be a very large one, the same pro- 
cess is gone through with, except the graining, the second time, which 
invariably leaves the skin soft and nice. This rule is slightly varied by 
some of the tribes. For example, the brains will be taken from the 
deer's head and cooked about half. This keeps it from spoiling. The 
skin is soaked longer to raise the grain, sometimes a little ashes being 
sprinkled on the skin, which makes the grain slip. After graining the 
skin is thrown into brain-water and soaked, instead of using the soap- 
root water. It is then worked as before described until soft. We now 
have buckskin. To prevent this from becoming stiff and hard when 
wet it is thoroughly smoked. This smoking process is also practiced 
by the settlers here, but I think the idea originated with the Indians. 
A ditch is cut in the ground about 2 feet deep and 20 or 25 feet long. 
At one end of this ditch a rough fire-place is made, being usually walled 
up with rock. Over the other end of the ditch is a large hollow log, 
something like a bee-gum, only larger and taller. In this the buckskins 
are hung, and the top of the gum pretty well closed. Sticks are laid 
cross-wise close together from one end of the ditch to the other and 
covered completely over with dirt. This makes a blind ditch from fire- 
place to the gum. A fire is now built in this fire-place, and the smoke 
naturally follows the ditch, there being an escape for the smoke in the 
top of the gum. The idea of having the ditch long is a good one ; the 
smoke becomes cool in its passage through the ground, and there is no 
danger of burning the buckskin. A buckskin is smoked two or three 
days. After this it can be washed like a piece of cloth, and when dry 
is equally as soft. 

The tribes belonging to the Shoshonian stock inhabiting the Great 
Interior Basin were formerly most expert manufacturers of buckskin 
leather. Clothing, tents, and much of their paraphernalia were made 
of three kinds — the white, the yellow, and the brown. The processes 
of preparing were identical in the main with those described. How- 
ever, the hair was removed in many cases by rolling up the hide in ashes 
wet with warm water for a few days. The hair was then removed by 
means of a wooden knife, a rib, or in later times with an old case-knife 
or bit of hoop-iron. The yellow and the brown skins received their 
tint by drying them over a smoldering fire of dry willow for the former 
and green willow for the latter color. The skins were vigorously pulled 
and stretched in every direction while the drying and smoking were 
going on. (Compare Plates XCI, XCII, XCIII.) 

Tanning among the Pawnees is thus effected : The hide is extended 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING. 573 

upon the grouud aud with an instrument resembling an adz, used in 
the manner of our carpenters, the adherent portions of dried flesh are 
removed and the skin rendered much thinner and lighter than before. 
The surface is then plastered over with the brains or liver of the ani- 
mal, which have been carefully retained for the purpose, aud the warm 
broth of meat is also poured over it. The whole is then dried after which 
it is again subjected to the action of the brains or broth, then stretched 
in a frame aud while still wet scraped with pumice-stone, sharp stones, 
or hoes until perfectly dry. Should it not be sufficiently soft it is sub- 
jected to friction by pulling it backward aud forward over it twisted 
sinew. 

This generally terminated the process. On the commencement of it 
the hides are almost invariably divided each longitudinally into two 
parts for the convenience of manipulations and when finished they are 
agaiu united by sewing with sinew. This seam is almost always pres- 
ent in the bison robe, but one of the largest we have seen is used for 
covering ou one of our beds, and has been dressed entire, being desti- 
tute of a seam. When the process of tanning and dressing is com- 
pleted and the inner surface of the skiu dry, figures are traced upon it 
with vermillion aud other showy colors. These are designed as orua- 
meuts, but are sometimes the record of important facts. (Long's Ex., 
Vol. I, pp. 221, 440.) 

The Senecas used to tan green hides. If a hide was dry it was soaked 
in the water of a running stream, after which it was stretched on a 
smooth log the size of a man's leg. With a knife-blade, placed in a 
curved stick, all the hair aud outside skiu was scraped off. After that 
the flesh was scraped off and the skin thoroughly dried. It was then 
soaked in a suds made of deer's brains aud warm water, one or two In- 
dians rubbiug with stones, much like those called axes plowed up in 
the fields, aud often pulling the skin. A hole 18 inches in diameter 
was then made in the ground and the skin suspended above it on upright 
sticks aud smoked, until the desired color is produced, by burning 
rotten wood beneath. The skin was then ready for use. 

Skin-dressing among the Eastern Indians is thus described : 

These skins they convert into, very good leather making the same plume and soft. 
Some of these skinues they dress with haire on and some with the haire off. The 
hairy side iu winter they weare next their bodies and in warme weather they weare 
the haire outwards. They make likewise some coates of the Feathers of Turkies 
which they weave together with twine of their owne makinge very prettily ; these 
garments they weare like mantels knit over their their shoulders and put under their 
amies. They have likewise another sort of mantels made of Mose skinnes, which 
beast is a great large Deere so biggo as a horse. These skinnes they commonly dresse 
bare and make them wonderous white and stripe them with size round about the 
borders, in form like lace set on byataylor and some they stripe with size in works of 
severall fashions very curious, according to severall fantasies of the workmen where- 
in they strive to excell one another. And mantels made of Beares skinnes is an usuall 
wearinge among the natives that live where the beares doe haunt. They make 
skinnes of Mose skinues, which is the principal lether used to that purpose and for

want of such let her which is the strongest, they make shoes of deeres skinnes very 
handsomely and commodious, and of such deeres skinnes as they dresse bare they 
make stockings that comes within their shoes, like a stirrup stockinge and is fastened 
above at their belt which is about their middell. A good well growne deere skin is of 
great account with them and it must have the tale on, or else they account it de- 
faced. The tale being three times as long as the tales of our English Deere, yea foure 
times solonge. This when they travell is raped round about their body and with a 
girdle of their making bound round about their middles to which girdle is fastened a 
bagg in which his instruments be with which hee can strike tire upon any occasion. 
Of their several arts and employments ; as lirst in dressing all manner of skinnes, 
which they do by scraping and rubbing, afterwards painting them with antique em- 
broyderings in unchangeable colors, sometimes they take oft" the haire especially if it 
bee not killed in reason. (Wood's N. England Prospect. Prince Pub. Soc. I. Page 
101.) 

DETAILS OF SKIN-DRESSING AMONG THE NAVAJOS. 

When the author at first contemplated this paper he found that the 
accounts of the most careful observers were not quite up to his require- 
ments. He therefore wrote to his friend Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, U. S. 
Arm t \, begging him to define the process as minutely as possible. The 
result was most satisfactory and was published in the Proceedings of 
the Museum for 1888. As much of Dr. Shufeldt's paper as is necessary 
to complete this narrative is here reproduced, together with the illus- 
trations. The reader should note especially the similarity of the hair 
scraper to those from Point Barrow, Labrador, the Interior Basin, and 
the graves of Madisonville, Ohio. (Plates LXI to LXVII.) 

Dr. Shufeldt employed a Navajo to do the work for him. In a day 
or two this Indian returned with a fine doe, an adult specimen of 
Cariacus macrotis. He had skinned the legs of the animal from the 
hoofs up as far as the ankles, which he disarticulated partially, so the 
limbs could be tied more compactly together, and thus be less liable 
to either frighten his horse or catch in the low timber as he returned 
home with his game. 

"The deer which had been captured for me had already been evisce- 
rated and the skin divided from its chin to its tail, the entire length of 
the under side of the animal. Iu a moment with a sharp hunting-knife 
he divided the skin on the inside of the thighs, from the ankles to the 
abdominal division, making similar incisions on the inside of the fore- 
limbs. The legs were quickly skinned, the small tail split up on its 
under side and the vertebne removed, while with his knife the hide 
was started on both sides from the abdominal and throat incision and 
quickly removed in the direction of the animal's back. Thus it was 
that the skin was removed from the entire body and up to the ears first; 
then as he arrived at the latter, their cartilages were cut through close 
to the skull, leaving the great ears of this species of deer attached to 
the hide. When he arrived at the eyes, these were skinned round, 
much iu the same way as a skilful taxidermist manages the eyes in any 
vertebrate specimen he may be preparing. Upon arriving at the muzzle 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING. 575 

he simply divided the skin all around, posterior to the external nostrils, 
and the operation of removing the hide was completed. (PI. LXI.) 
He next proceeded to dig a hole in the ground about as big as a bushel. 
The bottom of this excavation was tramped hard with his feet and the 
hide placed therein, hair side up, and immediately covered with cold 
water. On top of the hide he placed a camp-kettle bottom side up, 
and braced it down with the spade. This was to prevent the skin from 
drying and to keep the dogs from eating it during the night. 

" In the morning he left the camp with an axe to soon return with 
the trunk of a small pine tree. At its thickest end it was about G 
inches through, and about 4 inches at the smaller extremity. From 
one side of the larger half he removed the bark, completely exposing 
the smooth surface of the wood beneath it. He next cut a deep notch in 
the big end of this stick, so as to assist in bracing it against the limb of 
a small cedar tree near by, with the smooth surface facing him and the 
small end of the stick resting firmly upon the ground some two feet 
from the base of the cedar tree. Around about was plentifully be- 
strewn some clean short hay, to prevent the hide from being soiled 
upon the ground beneath. He now returned to the hole where the 
skin had remained over night, and it was taken out to be washed in 
clean water, when he proceeded with a sharp knife to remove all super- 
fluous tissue from its raw side, skinned the ears carefully by removing 
completely the cartilaginous parts, then cleared away the muscles 
which had remained attached about their bases, trimmed off the remains 
of the panniculus muscle, and indeed left nothiug but a thoroughly 
clean hide which received its final dip in clear water. 

" It was now ready to have the hair shaved from it. The tanner 
obtained his scrapers from the bones of the fore limb of the deer he had 
killed, and the ulna and radius of this limb are wonderfully well fitted 
to perform the work of this natural spoke-shave. These bones, as we 
well know, are, in a deer, as m many other hoofed animals, quite 
firmly united together, having a form well known to the comparative 
osteologist. The shaft of the ulna, which is closely approximated to 
the shaft of the radius, has its posterior edge thin and sharp, which is 
still further improved by the tanner scraping it with his knife. The 
olecranon process, with the deep sigmoid notch, forms an excellent 
handle at one end, while the enlarged distal end of the radius, with the 
carpal bones, which are usually left attached, forms a good one at the 
other. Moreover, the curvature of the shafts of this consolidated bone 
is favorable for the use of our Indian tanner, who, in using this primi- 
tive instrument, slings it at either end in his hands, and works with it 
in shaving off the hair much iu the same manner as one of our carpen- 
ters uses a spoke-shave, only here the sharp edge of the ulna bone takes 
the place of the knife-edge iu doing its special work. (Plate LXII.) 

" Before proceeding further I should mention that, after removing the 
hide, on the first day he placed the skinned head of the deer, without 



57 b' REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

the lower jaw, in the low ashes of a camp-fire, where the brains were 
able t» become semi-baked during the first night, as these parts too 
are utilized in the tanning process. 

"Next to shaving off" the hair, the hide is thrown over a small log he 
had arranged against the tree in the morning, being held in place by 
catching the skin of the head between the notch and the limb, the skin 
of the hinder parts being always nearer the ground, and as the work 
proceeds it is deftly shifted about by the tanner. 

" Now all the hair, except on the lower parts of the legs and the tail, 
is rapidly scraped off with these bone scrapers, including the black epi- 
dermis. Some tanners use a deer's rib, or that of the beef, and others 
a dull hunting-knife, but the bones of the deer's fore-arm is the usual 
instrument, and it is quite remarkable to observe how skilfully it is 
managed, and how rarely a hole is cut in the skin. The shaving is car- 
ried to the very edges of the hide all around, and even the backs of the 
ears are carefully scraped, the entire operation lasting from two to four 
hours, depending upou the size of the deer. 

" In appearance the hide now has the same form as when removed 
from the animal, the hair side is clean and white, the body side devoid 
of all superfluous tissue, the back of the ears still showing the black 
epidermal layer of the skin, as it is only from these parts where it is 
not scraped off with the hair ; the hair also is left on the skin of the 
lower halves of the four limbs. 

"A. thorough washing is now given it in several changes of clear, 
cold water, though sometimes in the last wash the water may be made 
slightly tepid, and in this it is allowed to stand while the tanner pre- 
pares the brains of the animal soon to be used in another stage of his 
work. Picking up the deer's skull from the ashes where he had left it 
the night before, he took an ax and split it along the bifrontal suture, 
cleaving the skull partly in two, then chipping oft* the parietal bones he 
was enabled to lift out the brains nearly entire. They were at once 
transferred to a basin of tepid water, where by gentle manipulation the 
little slivers of the bone (which had gotten into it while splitting the 
cranium), the blood, etc., were effectually removed. Next they were 
placed in a small quantity of tepid water in another basin and put upou 
a low fire, where they were allowed to simmer for over an hour. At 
the end of this time the water, then being not so hot but that one could 
comfortably hold his hand in it, had come to be of a muddy color, and 
our tanner, using the fingers of one hand as a sieve, lifted out from the 
water the little particles of brain in a small pile upon the palm of his 
opposite hand; then, by rubbing this together between the palms of 
his hands, it was soon reduced to a pasty mass. This process was con- 
tinued until all the brains were thus reduced and dissolved, and then 
the water in which they were had about three times its quantity of 
tepid water added to it, nearly filling the small basin. 

"Eeturuiug to the skin, it was now removed from the water where it 
had been left, carefully rinsed, and wrung out with the hands much as

we see washing women wring clothes, and carried over to the tree 
where the scraping process had been done. Here the tanner selected 
a small limb about 5 or C feet from the ground and passed the head and 
neck of the hide under and over it, and then carefully folded this latter 
part lengthwise along the middle of the body surface of the hide, and 
twisted the whole over and over again until he came to the fore legs. 
It will be seen that the limb was firmly folded within a loop of the 
hide, and by pulling heavily upon it I saw that there was no such 
thing as its slipping. In a similar manner the skin of the fore legs was 
folded lengthwise inside the hide; then the borders of the abdominal 
incision were likewise folded in, and in turn the skin of the hind legs, 
but this latter had, of course, to be thrown in, in the direction of the 
tree, so as to include them. The borders of the hinder parts were 
thrown over in such a way as to form a loop like the one around the 
limb of the tree. During all of this operation the hide was being twisted 
from left to right, and at its completion looked like a wet hide rope, 
fast, as we have described, to the tree at one end and looped over a 
stick about two feet long at its middle at the other. This latter was 
used as a twister by the tanner, for now he proceeded to wriug the 
hide thoroughly by twisting it over in one direction, causing the water 
to be rapidly squeezed out of it. (PI. LXIII.) By continuance of this 
twisting the skin was finally brought up close to the limb of the tree in 
a hard coil, where by hooking the turning stick under the limb it was 
held in that position and allowed to drip for nearly an hour. At the 
end of the above-mentioned time the Indian unhooked the stick, un- 
twisted the hide, and took it down. It had apparently shrunk two- 
thirds of its size, and looked like a damp, semi-tauued dog-skin. The 
tanner immediately set to work to pull it into shape as he walked in 
the direction of his camp-fire. 

" Spreading out a small buffalo robe, he sat down on it (Plate LXIV) 
and proceeded to pull the hide vigorously with his hands in every direc- 
tion. Catching hold of the extreme edges, he tugged away at it until 
it was nearly its original size. I noticed, however, that he only em- 
ployed his hands in this part of the operation, and never once resorted 
to his feet for assistance in the stretching. 

"After he was satisfied that the entire surface of the hide was opened 
and exposed again, he carefully spread it out perfectly flat, with the 
hair side up, upon the buffalo robe on which he had been sitting; then, 
taking his basinful of dissolved deer brains, he commenced applying it 
with his hand to the surface from which the hair had been removed. 
It is never put on the opposite side of the skin. In doing this he fre- 
quently rubbed the solution well in, using his open hand for the pur- 
pose, and as he came to the head, cars, and legs he, worked the stuff in 
with his fingers, and occasionally kneade.Lit with his knuckles, going- 
over the entire skin on the side referred to until his basin of braius was 
expended and the whole had been worked in as described. (Plate LXV. 
H. Mis. 224, pt. 2 37 



578 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1880. 

"Upon asking hiin why he put it only on the hair side, he gave me 
to understand that the pores were on that side, and consequently the 
brains could get into the skin more effectually, and upon inquiring why 
he put them on at all, he said, 'To make it soft.' Buckskin that is 
tanned without using brains is harsh and stiff' afterwards, and still 
worse in these particulars if it happens to get wet at any time. 

" The Navajoes often use beef brains for this purpose, especially when 
their game is taken far from camp and they do not care to pack the 
deer skulls home on their ponies. In early days they employed deer 
brains as a rule, but in some cases the brains of the buffalo, when that 
animal existed in their country. 

"Finally, as the last step of the process, he commenced, by folding 
in the edges of the skin all round continuously, to make it up into an 
ellipsoidal ball, quite firm, though not tightly rolled. He then wrapped 
it up in the buffalo robe and allowed it to remain out in the sun for 
about fifteen minutes for the purpose, he said, ' of letting the brains go 
well into him.' 

"Once more in its wet and limp condition it is thoroughly opened, 
and this time spread out over the top of a sage bush near by with the 
outer surface exposed to the sun and sufficiently from the ground to 
prevent the dogs from getting at it, or its being soiled through accident. 
It was now about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and very warm, and the 
skin at once commenced to show the effects of it as the first stages of 
drying set in. Nevertheless, I was informed that the hide would now 
be allowed to remain there and dry until dark, when it would be placed 
up on top of the " hogan " for the night, or in the event it rained, to be 
taken in and hung up on the mside. Next morning I was on the ground 
at 9 o'clock, and was thoroughly surprised at the appearance of the 
hide when it was brought out and shown me. Although I was familiar 
with the making of buckskin, not only as practiced by the Navajoes, 
but by the Sioux and other North Americau Indians, I never happened 
to have seen it in this particular stage, that is, right after the drying on 
the second day. 

" I found that it had again shrunken so as to be not more than one- 
third of its original size, or just after it had been removed from the 
animal. It was hard and appeared almost brittle, as though it might 
be broken in two ; moreover it was semi-transparent, and easily trans- 
mitted the light through it, or even prominent objects might be out- 
lined through it in favorable lights. In color it was of a deep, muddy 
amber, or a semi-trauslucenc Roman ocher, and one would never have 
suspected in the world that it was either a deer hide, or that in a few 
short hours it be converted into the softest and most durable fabric in 
the country — a tanned buckskin. 

By the exercise of considerable ingenuity and careful bending he now 
forced the skin into a large camp-kettle containing water from which 
the chill had been taken off by the addition of a little warm water, aud 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING. 570 

in this it was allowed to soak well for the next three hours, standing 
all this time out in the morning sun. 

Some of the Indians insist that this soaking should be done in cold 
water (spring water), and a new Mexican guide who has been among 
the Navajoes for many years, being an excellent tanner himself, claims 
that it is almost tbe universal practice to soak it in cold water on the 
morning of the third day instead of in tepid water. However, there 
was but little difference, for on the present occasion the water was 
almost cold from the start, and quite so after the skin had been in 
twenty minutes. This washing, the Indians tell me, was to remove all 
traces of the brains which were rubbed into the skin on the day before. 
He next gives it three or four thorough rinsings in clear cold water, and 
takes it over to the tree to wring it. This is done precisely in the man- 
ner already described above and shown in the plates. 

" Likewise it is curled once more, made into a coil, twisted and re- 
twisted upon itself, and allowed to drip in this condition for nearly half 
an hour. It is then once more undone and drawn out into shape, as 
on a previous occasion after wringing. 

" He is very careful now in exposing the entire surface; pulling the 
edges, stretching the skin of the ears, flattening out the skin that cov- 
ered the legs, and paying similar attention to the little tail. 

" In the mean time he had brought a large square piece of canvas 
and spread it out upon the ground near where he was at work. It is 
upon this that the last stages of the operation will be performed. 
Bringing next a sharp knife, it takes him but a moment to whittle out 
from a soft piece of pine an instrument that resembled a large woodeu 
awl. This, with the knife, he threw upon the canvas sheet, where 
they may be distinctly seen in Plate LXVI. To return to our hide, how 
different it looks after this second wringing; but he persists in pulling 
away at the edges all around, over and over again, until the whole is 
manipulated into a shape to suit him. Even this primary handling now 
has its effect, and in some places the skin begins to grow like buck- 
skin. At last he sits down on the middle of the canvas sheet, having 
first thrown aside his hat and removed his moccasins. He wears nothing 
but his thin Navajo shirt and trousers, while beside him is his wooden 
awl and sharp knife. (Plate LXVI.) 

" He threw the now limp skin lengthwise over his naked feet and 
pulled it with both hands in the direction of his body. Rapidly re- 
peating this operation, he turned it and tugged at it the other way. 
But it was most often thrown oxer his feet and vigorously pulled 
towards him. Then he stretched it out with his hands, pulled it this 
way and then pulled it that, worked at the edges to get them limp and 
pliant, manipulated the ears and the skin of the legs. But during all 
this an interesting change was coming o#er it, the heat of an August 
sun was rapidly drying it, it was fast coming to a velvet like softness 
throughout, and attaining its original size, it was changing to a uui- 



580 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

form pale clay color. The hair side was smooth, while the inside was 
roughish. Indeed, in a few moments more it was buckskin. 

"Picking up next his wooden awl, he commenced far forward on the 
extreme edge of the skin on the right side of the neck, and by succes- 
sively stretching it over the handle of the awl, cut upon this edge some 
dozen or thirteen holes with his knife. Then beginning in front, he put 
the awl in every hole, and by holding on to the edge of the opposite 
side with his left hand he was enabled to powerfully stretch the skin of the 
neck transversely. This operation is showu in Plate LXV1. His mark 
must go on next, so turning the skin of head over, he cut on either side 
just below the ear on the body or inner surface of the skin a leaf-like 
figure, with the apex pointing forward and outward. 

"This was the last touch of all, aud the now finished fabric, if we 
may call it a fabric, so pliant, so soft, and withal so useful, was spread 
out on the canvas for an hour in the sun to receive its final drying, 
after which it passed into the possession of the National Museum. One 
of these finished skins retains much the same form as the hide had 
when first removed, though it may be rather longer from the stretch- 
ing. The backs of the ears are always black ; the edges all around are 
uneven aud harder than the rest of the skin; the hair remains upon 
the distal moieties of the skin of the legs ; bullet-holes of exit aud en- 
trance will be usually seen, and there may be au accidental rent or two 
of small size. 

" The Navajoes value these hides at a price varying from $1.50 to $2, 
depending upon the size and the need they have of the money. Squaws, 
I am told, never engage in manufacturing them, while the Indian boys 
learn the art at a very early age." 

SKIN-DRESSING AMONG ABORIGINES OF OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. 

In Patagonia the skin of the guanaco is dried with the hair on in 
such a manner that when wet it retains its pliability and softness. This 
process of preserving skins seems to be peculiar to the Indian tribes, 
and is not unlike that by Avhich buffalo robes, bear skins, and other 
articles of luxury and even necessity among us are prepared by the 
North American Indians. Guanaco skins are cut into pieces of all sizes 
and sewed into a thousand fanciful patterns, every workman originat- 
ing a style to suit himself. (Bourne, " Captive in Patagonia," p. 53.) 

The following is the method among the Fors in Darfur, Central 
Africa: As soon as the animal has been skinned the skins are scraped 
aud put into water in which okun (the bark of a tree) has been mixed. 
After several days they are taken out, scraped again with iron knives, 
and afterwards pegged out under the shade of a tree or under a shed 
made for the purpose. They are then rubbed aud beaten with flat 
stones. At times they are also rubbed with butter. (Proc. Roy. Soc. 
of Edinburgh, 1884-'85, p. 262.) 

The Wagaudas are good tanners and manage to get their skins as

soft as the best kid leather. In some cases the hair is removed, but 
generally it is left on. They first dry the skins in the sun, then stretch 
them on a frame, and the inner surface is carefully scraped with a sharp 
knife. They are then rubbed for a long time with flat heavy stones 
until quite smooth. This produces a fine grain. Butter or oil is then 
applied in considerable quantities aiyl the skin once more placed in the 
sun. This latter process is repeated several times. Both men and 
women are employed in tanning. Some skins are dyed after the hair 
has been removed, others have patterns printed on them, and the thick 
buffalo hide, from which sandals are made, is ornamented by either 
a knife or a red-hot nail. Leather rope is sometimes used in house- 
building, if so, it is without tanning. Straps, traps, and nets are first 
tanned. (Proceedings Royal Soe., Edinburgh, 1881-'86, p. 730.) 

Friendly Islanders remove the hair and entrails of the hog with 
knives of split bamboo, also used in carving cooked pig. Nutka Sound, 
iron, knife, chisel, mallet, polisher. (Cook.) 

In making an opossum rug the Yarra tribe employ some skill and 
knowledge. In the first place, it is necessary to select good, sound, 
well-clothed skins. These, as they are obtained, are stretched on a 
piece of bark and fastened down by wooden or bone pegs, and kept there 
until they are dry. They are then well scraped with mussel-shell or a 
chip of basalt, dressed into proper shape, and sewn together. (H. B. 
Smyth, Aborigines of Victoria, I, 1878, p. 271.) 

THE SCRAPER. 

Wheuever the savage has come in contact with the whites he has 
been quick to substitute iron for stone in his arrow-heads, knives, etc. 
Not so with his scraper. Indeed the white man keeps up the use of 
stone, glass, etc., in his modern tannery. In some respects these im- 
plements are the most interesting example of the history of the civiliza- 
tion of man. They may not actually be the earliest implement made or 
used, but they have been the longest in use. We might despair of ex- 
plaining their extreme antiquity. 

They commence to appear with the earliest age of man and have con^ 
tinned in use to the present day, and are essentially the same instru- 
ment now as at the beginning. Their use was all but universal among 
the prehistoric peoples of North America, but they were equally uni- 
versal in the paleolithic era. They were the principal implement of the 
early cave dwellers in western Europe and so continued through all the 
other prehistoric ages. They extend through all time among all peoples 
and have figured in all civilizations. Neither in form nor substance did 
it change perceptibly during the prehistoric ages. It is the one endur- 
ing implement that was also used by prehistoric man. It is therefore 
of the utmost importance for the archaeologist who wishes to rehabilitate 
a certain ancient culture to consider carefully all the elements of that 
culture which crystallize around this little implement. He may have in 



582 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

his cabinet a few pieces of stone which he labels "scrapers." At once 
in looking at them there springs upon the imagination of the philosophic 
student visions of clothing, houses, beds, furniturs, boats, lines for all 
conceivable purposes, the paraphernalia of state, ceremony and religion, 
the garniture of the dead. 

We may now pay attention to particular examples. Laying aside for 
the moment flaying, sharpening, cutting, and sewing tools, the reader is 
invited to look especially at the collection of scrapers in the U. S. Na- 
tional Museum. (Plates LXVII-XCIII.) 

Under this general table have been grouped together all of those 
aboriginal implements which belong to the tanner's craft. They are 
found in all the countries where man has used the depilated skins 
of animals for any purpose whatever. In the American Continent this 
region is bounded on the north, only by the line of uninhabited territory. 
It extends southward through Greenland, Alaska, Canada, and the 
United States. The warm climate of middle America requires the sub- 
stitution of vegetable clothing, so that the scraper is no longer a neces- 
sity. The essential elements of a scraper are its grip or handle and its 
working portion or blade. In the first scrapers the blade and grip were 
one. Indeed the Little Lake, Concow, and Eedwood Indians used for- 
merly the dried rib of a large mammal, and now think there is nothing 
better than the rib of a steer without any change of form. (Plates 
LXXXIV, fig. 3.) This implement is caused to vary in structure by the 
following conditions: (1) The natural supply of material. (2) The skins 
to be manipulated. (3) The tribal technique. (4) The culture grade of 
the people. 

Even among the Eskimo one can see how in the change of location 
slate, chert, and jade replace one another. This is a universal law of 
industries. 

Again, to prepare a seal-skin for the Bidarka demands a different 
treatment and tool from those required in producing the soft product of 
the antelope hide by the Navajo. 

Not so well as in language, nevertheless, in a marvelous degree, the 
history of a people is written in their implements and industries. Tribes 
have their own ways of doing things. A museum curator has reason 
to be thankful for this every day, owing to the careless manner in which 
many of his acquisitions are labeled. 

Again, the nicety of the tool is a sure guarantee of the status of a 
people. The cylindrical scrapers are variously made. A segment from 
the hollow base of a walrus tusk, a strip of antler bent into the form of 
a hoop and properly lashed, or a strip of the same material strained to 
the form of a horseshoe, has a cable of raw-hide stretched between the 
calks of the shoe. In all of these, one edge of the cylinder is sharpened 
to a chisel edge to increase its efficiency. The cup-shaped scraper made 
of walrus ivory is often labeled in collections as a vessel, but a slight 
inspection will show that it is a veritable tool. The shape is that of a 
low oblong pan, not over 3 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch high. 






ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING. 583 

This is grasped iu the haiid, bottom up, and drawn across the hide until 
a quantity of fat is secured, which is deftly conveyed to the stone lamp 
or some convenient receptacle. (Plates LXXX-LXXXI.) 

In connection with the making of moccasin is the art of tanning 
deer-skins. It is done with the brain of the deer, the tanning properties 
of which, according to tradition, were discovered by accident. The 
brain is mingled with moss, to make it adhere sufficiently to be formed 
into a cake, which is afterwards hung by the fire to dry. It is thus 
preserved for years. When the deer skin is fresh, the hair, and also 
the grain of the skin are taken off, over a cylindrical beam, with a 
wooden blade or stone scraper. A solution is then made by boiling a 
cake of the brain in water, and the moss, which is of no use, being re- 
moved, the skin is soaked in it for a few hours. It is then wrung out 
and stretched, until it becomes dry and pliable. Should it be a thick 
one, it would be necessary to repeat the process until it becomes 
thoroughly penetrated by the solution. The skin is still porous and 
easily torn. To correct both, a smoke is made, and the skin placed over 
it in such a manner as to inclose it entirely. Each side is smoked in 
this way until the pores are closed, and the skin has become thoroughly 
toughened, with its color chauged from white to a kind of brown. They 
also use the brain of other animals, and sometimes the backbone of the 
eel, which, pounded up and boiled, possesses nearly the same properties 
for tauniug. Bear-skins were never tanned. They were scraped and 
softened, after which they were dried, and used without removing the 
hair, either as an article of apparel or as a mattress to sleep upon. 
(Lewis H. Morgan, League of the Iroquois, 1851, pp. 301, 362.) 

After flaying the seal, the Eskimo often finds the inner surface of the 
skin coated with fat, and the first operation is to remove this by means 
of a special tool, which we may call the fat-scraper. By means of this 
the fat is scraped clean from the hide and placed in the soap-stone lamp, 
for which purpose some of the forms are specially adapted. These im- 
plements occur in the Eskimo area all the way from Ungava to Kodiak 
and are of three forms, the spoon-shaped, the cylindrical, and the cup- 
shaped scraper. The simplest form is a segment of reindeer scapula 
(Rangifer tarandm), so cut as to have the inferior border at the back of 
the knife and the thin part between this border and the spine for the 
blade. This implement is also used for scaling and opening salmon and 
is a most efficient tool. Almost as simple as the foregoing, is a fat- 
scraper made of the split antler of the reindeer. The spongy part is 
scraped out and the borders brought to the proper edge. Some speci- 
mens of this type are ingeniously worked out, so as to have one of the 
small prongs for a handle, while the spoon or scraping portion is from 
the split portion of the antler. Bits of walrus-tusks are also carved 
into the shape of a long-bladed spoon. From the long spoon-shaped 
scraper, branches off, in the region between Behrings Strait and Norton 
Sound, a very dainty ladle-shaped implement with projections on the. 



584 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, L889 



hinder margin to tit tbe fingers. This is a very effective tool, both in 
its grip and the handiness with which its contents may be conveyed to 
the lamp. (Plate LXIX.) 

There is not so great a variety of apparatus in the hand of tbe abo- 
riginal leather worker as will be found at present in possession of the 
civilized craftsmen, yet there are several classes of tools worthy of at- 
tention. 

The pre-Columbian butcher's or flaying knife has not been sufficiently 
studied. This will form the subject of a subsequent chapter. 

The leather cutting knife is also worthy of careful study. Among 
the Eskimo collections it goes by the name of woman's knife or ulu. 
Among our modern industries this peculiar Eskimo form has a curious 
history. When women ceased to be leather workers and went into the 
kitchen they carried the ulu with them, but transferred it to another 
function, that of meat chopping. On the other hand, when men became 
leather workers, they borrowed this same implement from the women, 
and it may be seen any day in the saddler's shop. All of these woman's 
knives have crescent-shaped or plano-convex blades set in handles of 
wood, musk-ox horn, antler, walrus ivory, and other substances peculiar 
to each region. The blades are of slate, jade, or metal and are kept 
sharp by rubbing with the incisor tooth of a beaver. Now there is no 
tool more common in our collections than this same knife. It is safe to 
say that no Eskimo girl or woman is without one or more. 

As we come further south the chipped thin blade takes the place of 
the smooth blade of the Eskimo, but only in very restricted areas has 
auy observer reported the Indians as using stone blades for cutting 
leather. 

Seeing the great numbers of this particular tool among modern sav- 
ages, it is incumbeut upon the archaeologist to look out among his 
specimens, the scissors, the shoemaker's knife, and the saddler's knife of 
pre-historic peoples. He will probably find them among the boxes he 
has been labeling spear-heads. 

The north Alaskan Eskimo type of scrapers consists of a grip more 
or less fitted to the hand and a chipped blade, with a varying length 
of shaft between them. In the handle the different type-forms grow 
out of the provisions made for accommodating the thumb, the first 
two fingers, the last two fingers, and the palm of the workman. 

In the front end of this handle the blade is inserted in a rude socket ; 
the rear of the handle slopes down like a Derby hat to form the palm 
rest. On the left side is the thumb groove, on the upper side are 
the first linger grooves, on the right side and bottom is a great sweeping 
excavation which maybe called the finger pocket. On grasping one 
of these implements one is struck with the ingenuity with which every 
part of the hand is brought into its maximum activity and every 
necessity of the operation provided for. (Plates LXXII to LXXIX.) 

The palm is provided with a nicely rounded surface for pushing, the 



ABORIGINAL SKIN-DRESSING. 585 

first lingers with the best facility for bearing down, the thumb for 
guiding, and the last two lingers for pulling the tool back, and at the 
same time they are protected from injury by the hide beneath. 

The student of technology is at every moment astonished to see how 
the Eskimo, wherever he sets out to invent, leaves nothing to be de- 
sired as regards facility. Remember, also, that as we go southward 
and get away from the walrus, the scraper handle is made of wood, 
and losing the graceful proportions of its northern relative, grows 
more and more like the tool of the southern Indians. 

Typical Eskimo scraper handles seem to be divided into two classes, 
even in the same locality, for which no reason is assigned. 

One class is characterized by an under-cut extending quite sym- 
metrically across the under side, and the material has some uniformity 
of thickness, as in a ladle. In most of these the grip descends to 
its base in the rear almost vertically, and in none of them is there 
any considerable tail piece. The linger grooves, except in a few aber- 
rant forms, are extremely shallow, and the outline above much curved. 

The other class is characterized by an under cut which primarily 
does not extend across the under side. The impression on a soft 
surface is quite similar to that of a human foot without toes. In 
some specimens the thumb side of the bottom is notched out some- 
what, but this has no functional connection with the real under-cut. 

Now, in all the specimens of this type the tail-piece is more or less 
pronounced. The finger grooves run the whole gamut of profundity, 
from a shallow groove to deep pockets in which half of each finger 
is buried. In outline this class is more parallel-sided. 

No literature is at hand upon the subject, but from the manner in 
which these implements are poised it would seem that they go in 
pairs, as the jack-plane and smoothing plane, the spoon shaped tool 
serving for the rough or first process, the flat-bottomed class for finer 
work in finishing. But this is only guessing. 

Every one who has handled a series of these implements has been 
astonished at the diminutive hands of the workwomen whohave wielded 
them. To dress the hide is womau's work, but the men also have small 
hands. Again, while I have found three left-handed throwing-sticks 
in a hundred; in more than a hundred scrapers I have never seen one 
left-handed. 

Scraper blades among the northwestern Eskimo are made from a 
plano-convex spall of black chert, jasper, etc., kept flat on the under 
face and chipped into shape on the upper face. The cutting edge is 
rounded and chisel-shaped, and is usually the broadest part of the blade. 
The general outline varies from circular, or even a flattened ellipse 
through infinite varieties, to an oblong parallelogram rounded at either 
end. Indeed, one and the same blade may be all of these forms at 
various periods of its existence by a process now to be explained. 

One of the commonest tools in ethnotechnic cabinets is the stone 



586 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

chipper of bone used in forming the edges of arrow-heads, spear-heads, 
scrapers, etc. The writer has only recently learned the indispensable 
character of this tool. In the first place every chipped implement after 
being separated from the parent block is made out and out with one of 
them. But this is only the beginning. The writer has lately learned 
that the hunter and the leather- worker are never without one, and they 
bring it into requisition with a frequency which reminds one of the old 
plantation slave sharpening his scythe every few minutes, to get a rest. 

Lieutenant Stoney, speaking of his experience at Kotzebue Sound, 
says that tne leather- worker is incessantly touching up his scraper 
edge with the chipper, and that in time he wears it out to a mere stub. 
This constant sharpening also accounts for the fact that few specimens 
show signs of great wear. It is important to repeat this, that the con- 
stant use of the edging tool rapidly wears down the scraper blade and 
keeps the edge sharp. This accounts for the great difference in the 
length of the blades in our cabinets and for the fact that they show so 
little sign of use. 

A very old skin-scraper, such as are now found only in the old graves, 
is made of stone, with a wooden handle, which is fastened to the stone 
by means of a strip of whalebone. Another and a later pattern is 
made from the scapula of the reindeer. A better idea of its manufac- 
ture can be got from the sketch than by a description. Such scrapers 
are still in use, but serve as a sort of auxiliary to a scraper made 
from a tin can, resembling a little scoop in shape and having a wooden 
handle. This is the style of scraper made at the present day and is 
by far the most effective instrument of the three. (Boas, VI An. Rep. 
Bur. Ethuol., Figs. 465, 466, 468.) 

The manner of using these scrapers is to take the skin firmly in the 
left hand and putting the knee or foot upon the lower part of it, hold 
it securely while the scraper is worked with the right hand, pushing 
downward with some force. If the skins are very dry they are some- 
what softened by rubbing with the hands, or even chewing the most 
stubborn parts. They continue using these tools upon a hide till it 
gains the desired pliability. 

After removing the fat with a muscle shell, the skins are tendered to 
the men, and especially to the guests, as a piece of civility to chew or 
gnaw betwixt meals. This is esteemed a delicacy. Then the skins are 
macerated or steeped in the urine tub. After that they are dried in the 
air a little and finally milled to perfection by their teeth. They make 
their thin light under- garments of the backs of the sea-fowl skins ; their 
warm winter garments of the bellies, and their fine holiday dress of the 
necks, and these they commonly turn feathers outward.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXVII. 

Fig. 1. Beaming Tool. Made of the tibia of a musk-ox. The bone has been hacked 

in so as to have the broad inner part of the posterior wing for a rest and 

the middle of the front portion for an edge. The natural form of tbe 

bone lends itself splendidly to this method of treatment. Compare this 

with Fig. 3, PI. LXVII, and Fig. 1, PI. LXXXIV. 

Cat No. 90248, U. S. N. M. Indians of Ungava, Canada. Collected by Lucien M. 
Turner. 

Fig. 2. BEAMING Tool. Made from the leg bone of the reindeer. Only half of the 

specimen is given, bnt enough remains to show the absolute similarity 

between this and the great number of broken implements of the same 

sort found in the Madisonville cemetery. Ohio. See next figure. The 

perforation on the lower side is common in many Eskimo tools. 

Cat. No. 89488, U. S. N. M. ■ Eskimo of Point Barrow. Collected by Capt. P. H. Ray, 
U. S. Army. 

Fig-. 3. Beaming Tool. Made from the leg bone of a deer. The bone has been cut 

away so as to afford two edges for removing the hair in skin working. 

This specimen comes from the celebrated cemetery at Madisonville, Ohio, 

and is here reproduced to show the great similarity of form in various 

parts of the country.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXVIII. 

Fig. 1. Grainer. Of the humerus of the musk-ox. The upper joint furnishes the 
handle and the hard portion of the bone cut diagonally forms the edge. 
Fine serrations on the edge furnish the graining surface.

Fig. 2. Graining Tool. Handle of pine. Blade of iron, finely toothed and lashed 
to the shaft with a buckskin strip. A thong fastened to the top of the 
handle passes around the wrist and catches the force of the blow. This 
is an excellent device for giving emphasis to the work of the tool.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXX. 

Fig. 1. Scraper. Blade of bone, with edge resembling that of a gouge, fastened 
to a pine handle by a seizing of sinew. The edge is very smooth and 
worn, and the specimen must have been used more as a beaming tool. 
The drawing marked (2) is a precisely similar form dug from the ash-pit 
graves of Madisonville. The attention of archaeologists is here called to 
the fact that all the specimens from that celebrated cemetery are allied to 
modern northern implements. 

Cat. No. 10307, U. S. N. M. Eskimo of Iglulik. Collected by Capt. C. F. Hall. 

Fig. 3. Scraper. Handle of soft wood, faintly and rudely cut in and grooved like 

the beautiful ivory specimens from Alaska. Thumb groove, fore and 

middle finger grooves atop; ring finger groove and undercut large: 

notch for finger, small. ' Th^ blade is a dull celt of sandstone let half its 

length into a socket in the end of the handle. Length, 4 inches. 

Cat. No. 34084, IT. S. N. M. Eskimo of Cumberland Gulf. Collected by L. Kumlien.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LX XIII. 

Fig. 1 (a and b). Scraper. Of walrus ivory. Thumb groove slight. Fingers sepa- 
rated by a ridge three and three-quarters inches in length. Undercut 
quite across and extending into a spoon-shape cavity of the palm rest, 
which is pierced for a suspending cord. This is a broad, heavy, and 
effective implement. 

Cat. No. 89321, U. S. N. M. Eskimo of Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Capt. P.

Fig. 2. Scraper. Of walrus ivory. There are no grooves for digits. The under- 
cut extends quite across and the implement rests on its front and rear 
edge. The palm "rest declines at an angle of 90 degrees and terminates 
abruptly without horizontal appendix. The blade, of reddish-brown jas- 
per, is held in its socket by a washer of rawhide.

Scrapers. 



EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXXIV. 

Fig. 1. Scraper. Of walrus ivory. A delicate, mottled specimen, shaped in front 
like the incisor of a horse. Thumb groove very slightly and delicately 
hollowed. There is an undercut on this side, but it serves no earthly pur- 
pose. In this and many other specimens this cut seems to be a fashion 
without an aim. The finger grooves are continuous to the margin next 
the stone blade and are models of graceful carving. The undercuts on 
both sides are nearly alike, causing the implement to rest on the front and 
rear. This is one of the most beautiful pieces in the Museum. 

Cat. No. 89317, U. S. X. M. Eskimo of Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Capt. P. 
H. Ray, U. S. Army. 
Fig. 3. Scraper. Of walrus ivory, resting upon the front and tailpiece. The thnml > 
groove a shallow pit. Front finger grooves slight hollows. Undercut 
extending entirely across, but much smaller on the thumb side. Blade 
of black chert, held in place by a packing of cord much broader than the 
handle. 

Cat. No. 89315, U. S. N. M. Eskimo of Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Capt. P. 
H. Ray, U. S. Army. 

Fig. 3. Scraper. Of walrus ivory. Heavy and high arched. The specimen is 
new and is ornamented with incised lines coarsely fringed. This speci- 
men has never been used and is the only one in the National Museum 
witli the slightest ornamentation, It rests upon the front margin of the 
blade socket and the edge of the declined tailpiece and is singularly 
lifted up. Thumb groove deep, bordered above by a long ear-shaped 
piece in high relief. The finger grooves are long, narrow, and deep. Tbe 
undercut is peculiar, that portion in which the fingers fit being sepa- 
rated from the more shallow portion on the left by a sharp offset. The 
ear-shaped projection will be noticed faintly on several other specimens.

Scrapers. 



EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXXV. 

Fig. 1. Scraper. Of walrus ivory. The specimen lies flat, touching a horizontal 
surface all around its underside. The last two specimens, on the con- 
trary, touch only at the front and rear. Thumb groove a deep furrow, 
almost concealing the digit. Finger grooves two slight cup cuttings for 
the tips. Undercut not extending all the way across, so that the lower 
margin under the thumb touches the ground all the way from front to 
real-. 

Cat. No. 89316, U. S. N. M. Eskimo of Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Capt. P.

Fig. 3. Scraper. A clumsy specimen of spruce wood resting upon a flat base, 
scarcely affected by the undercut. Tbe thumb groove wide and for the 
first joint a deep pocket. Uppej; finger groove only for the forefinger. 
For the middle finger there is a separate undercut pocket and for the 
last two fingers the undercut is deeply pocketed. The front is precipi- 
tate, 2 inches high; the rear prolonged into a flat tailpiece, broader than 
the rest of the implement. There are a few specimens of this class made 
of wood, unique in form, but there are no others with precipitate front.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXXVI. 

Fig. 1 (a and b). Scraper. Handle or grip of wood, with deep pocket grooves for 
the digits. The thumb is almost hidden in its cavity. On top there are 
three grooves for the fore, the middle, and the ring finger, respectively, 
and a very deep pocket into which the ends of all three are concealed. 
The little finger fits into a deep pocket on the right side and there is not 
the slightest shadow of undercut, the lower surface resembling exactly 
that of a carpenter's plane. The blade, of drab flint, is neatly inserted 
into the front and packed with canvas. A blue bead inserted on top in 
front of the finger pocket is the only ornament.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXXVII. 

Fig. 1. Scraper. Handle of spruce. Thumb groove fitted to both phalanges of 
the thumb. Finger grooves slight. Undercut only two-thirds across 
the bottom, giving the implement a rest along the entire left side. The 
top is arched high up and there is a slight bell-shaped tailpiece. Blade 
of black chert, secured with a leather washer into a grooved socket — that 
is. half the depth of the mortise is cut out on the sides. This would fit a 
blade of any width. 

Ci t. No. 63847, U. S. N. M. Eskimo of Point Hope, Alaska Collected by Capt. P.

Fig. 2. Scraper. Handle of hard wood. Thumb groove deep and long, over which 
an ear-shaped projection is carved, as in Plate LXXIV, Fig. 3, from Point 
Barrow. Finger groove rounded out to give the appearance of a skull 
and terminating 1 inch behind the stone blade. Undercut not wide and 
hook-shaped in base outline. The tailpiece is gouged out like the rim of 
a beli. This form is quite an oddity and leads to the conclusion that each 
implement was made to fit the hand of the workman. This being the 
case they reveal as great a diversity in the size of Eskimo hands as exists 
among the white race.

Fig. 3. Scraper. Of walrus ivory. A very graceful old handle, much discolored, 
resting on the front or haft and the broad flattened tailpiece. Thumb 
groove shallow, but exactly fitting and bounded above by the ear-shaped 
ridge so prominent in Plate LXXIV, Fig. 3, from Point Barrow. Finger 
grooves extending to the stone blade. Undercut consists of two distinct 
parts, that for the last two fingers and a smaller one under the thumb, 
a common characteristic, but serving only to remove useless material. 
The tailpiece is long, broad, and gracefully curved into the grip.

Fig. 1 (a and b). Scraper. Handle of spruce wood, with marked characteristics, 
resting on the front and long tailpiece and slightly arched up in the mid- 
dle. Thumb groove profound, finger grooves moderately .deep. Under- 
cut two-thirds the distance across the bottom. Between this and the 
blade is a cul-de-sac for the third or ring finger. The grip is high arched 
and the flat tailpiece projects abruptly from its base. The socket is 
broad and intrudes slightly on the sides. Split by a stone blade, the old 
device of a groove and lashing has been resorted to.

gin. There is a delicious continuity of curvature over the entire surface 
of this specimen, so that not a single sharp turn occurs anywhere except 
in the socket.

Fig. 1. Scraper. Of spruce wood. High arched on top and resting on its two 
ends. The thumb groove is dee]) and pocketed. Finger grooves deeply 
pocketed and divided by a thin partition. Undercut two-thirds across

Fig. 2. Scraper. Of walrus ivory. An abnormal specimen, made from the proxi- 
mal end of a walrus tusk. Evidently the maker racked his ingenuity to 
get the most out of his material. Provision for the thumb and first two 
fingers is made by the core cavity in front. The undercut trenches 
largely on the same cavity, which extends onward through the grip. The 
socket is mortised an inch deep.

Fig. 3. Scraper. Handle of pine wood: blade of drab-colored chert: lashing of 
unshredded sinew, with washers of rawhide. This is a rude specimen, 
representing only the outline and commencement of the type characters 
in the one-handed scraper. There is no thumb groove on the side: no 
finger groove on the top. On the under face of the right-hand side are 
two very shallow grooves for the ring and little finger. The protection 
of the hand is secured by the angle of the handle. The blade has chip- 
pings only on the upper side. It is laid in a roughly gouged hollow, so 
as to bring its under surface flush with that of the handle. A Pawnee 
Indian informed the writer that the careless lashing on so many hafted 
tools is owing to the fact that the blade is continually taken out to lie 
sharpened, which tallies with Lieutenant Stoney's testimony.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXXX. 

Fig. 1. Fat-scraper. Dish-shaped. Made from a section of walrus tusk. This 
form of scraper might easily be mistaken for a dish, but an examination 
of the edge shows that on one side at least it has been scraped down 
sharp. There are types of these scrapers— the dish-shaped, the hoop- 
shaped, the horseshoe-shaped, the knife or spoon shaped, the scoop- 
shaped,, and the ring-shaped, and each shape has a definite locality.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE LXXXI. 

Fig. 1. Fat-scraper. A strip of ivory 6 inches long, 1 inch wide, and shaped like a 
knife blade, one-eighth of an inch thick at the back, where it is also bent 
and held in position by a rawhide string passed once or twice across 
through holes in the ends of the ivory and then carefully wrapped around 
tbe cross strings. Its use is said to be for scraping fat from seal skins 
to be put in the soapstone lamps.

Fig. 2. Fat-scraper. Made of a section of the lower end of a walrus tusk sawed 
off like a napkin ring. The inner side being soft and the outer side hard, 
it is the easiest thing in the world to scrape away the soft part, so as to 
have an edge like the tooth of a rodent. Used to remove fat from skins 
before dressing them. This form of scraper is not found in the Museum 
collection except from Sledge Island and the Diomedes.

margin of the antler strip is scraped to an edge from within, so as to pre- 
serve the outer hard portion for work.

THE PUMA, OR AMERICAN LION : FELIS CONCOLOR OF LINMUS. 



By Frederick \Y. True, 
Curator of the Department of Mammals. 



The Puma is the only large, unspotted, native American cat.* The 
general color of the fur is tawny, but on the under surfaces of the body 
it is whitish. The color of the central line of the back is darker than 
that of tbe sides and the end of the tail is dusky brown. The ears are 
black externally, with a central whitish area. The upper lip is white 
from the nostrils to the middle of the month, and at the latter point is 
a prominent black spot. The nostrils are flesh-colored. Baird com- 
pares the color of the Prima to that of the Virginia deer, and states that 
it varies with the seasons as it does in the deer ; that is, the summer 
coat is reddish and the winter coat grayish. t 

There is much variation in color among individuals of this species, 
but it has not been proven that this is correlated with the varying 



* Nine species of cats are found in North America uorth of the Isthmus of Pan- 
ama. These are — 

The Puma, Felis eoneolor Linue. 

The Jaguar, Felis onca Linue. 

The Ocelot, Felis partialis Linne". 

The Tiger Cat, Felis tigrina Erxleben. 

The Eyra, Felis eyra Desmarest. 

The Yaguaruudi, Felis yaonarundi Desmarest. 

Tbe Bay Lynx, Lynx rufus (Giildenstiidt). 

The Plateau Lynx, Lynx, baileyi Merriam. 

The Canada Lynx, Lynx canadensis (Desmarest). 

The Puma, on account of its wonderfully extensive range, reaching from Patagonia 
to Canada, may perhaps be considered as the most characteristic of American animals, 
though it is less powerful than the Jaguar. The, Jaguar and Ocelot enter the terri- 
tory of the United States only on the extreme southwestern border. The Eyra, Ya- 
guarundi, aud Tiger Cat have never been found north of the Rio Grande. The Lynxes 
are common in the United States. The spotted form of the Bay Lynx, found in Texas, 
and the banded form, found in Oregon and Washington, have been described as sep- 
arate species, uuder the names Lynx maoulatus and Lynx fasciatus. They are now 
generally regarded as geographical races; of the Bay Lynx, The Canada Lynx is a dis- 
tinct species.

climatic conditions of its range.* The occurrence of albino Pumas in 
the Alleghany Mountains and in New Mexico has been reported, but 
not authoritatively.! 

Burmeister remarks on this point: " Very rarely individuals of this 
species of a brown, nearly black color have been found, while differ- 
ences in color between yellowish-brown and yellowish gray are not rare. 
I am aware that individuals nearly white and others nearly black have 
been observed, but I have never seen such myself." $ 

New-born Pumas are very different in appearance from the adults. 
Instead of being of uniform color, the back and legs are covered with 
large blackish-brown spots, and the tail is ringed with the same color.§ 
According to Dr. W. A. Conklin these markings disappear in about six 
months after birth. || 

The male Puma represented in Plate XCIVis of the following dimen- 
sions : Head and body, measured along the curves, 53 inches ; tail, 26J 

* There is an early allusion to this matter in Miiller's translation of Linnseus's Sys- 
tem of Nature, published in 1796. After mentioning the discrepancy between Pen- 
nant's and Schreber's measurements of the Puma, this author remarks : " It is not, 
however, to be wondered at that different measurements are given, when it is con- 
sidered that the two animals from which they were taken were born in such very 
differeut regions. The climate likewise contributes to changes in their disposition, 
and hence those living in North America are much less ferocious and much weaker 
than those which are born in hotter regions. It has influence also upon the color. 
In the Iroquois country the species is gray, in other regions reddish." (Miiller, Linux's 
Natursyst. Fortsetzung nach 13ten Ausgabe, 1. Theil, Siingethiere, 1796, p. 207.)

$ This difference between the young aud adults in coloration led the veracious 
Garcilasso de la Vega into error. In his Royal Commentaries he writes : "A Spaniard 
whom I knew killed a great lioness in the country of the Antis, near Cuzco. She 
had climbed into a high tree, and was killed by four thrusts of a lance. They found 
two whelps in her belly, which were sous of a tiger, for their skins were marked with 
their sire's spots." (Royal Commentaries, 1609, book 8. <^ Hakluyt Society, xli, 
1869, p. 385.) According to Castelnau, young North American Pumas have white 
spots. Burmeister states that he never saw such individuals in Brazil.

Linueau Soc, New York, i, 1882, p. 35, foot-note. 

They persist, however, though always more or less indistinct, until the animal has 
reached its full size, or perhaps in some cases, throughout life. The term spotted, 
notwithstanding, can not be applied to the species in the same sense as to the Jaguar, 
Leopard, aud Ocelot. It may be mentioned in this connection that lions, which to 
the eye are unspotted, sometimes appear in photographs as spotted animals. I sub- 
join some notes on the color of a number of flat skins of Pumas, which I recently ex- 
amined through the kiudness of Mr. F. S. Webster, of Washington. 

(a) Length without tail, 4 feet 9 inches. Color very pale tawny. Spots apparent 
on all parts of the body. 

(b) Length without tail, 4 feet 4 inches. Shows spots of darker tawny than the 
general color of the body. 

(c) Length without tail, 4 feet 7 inches. Color very pale. Shows very faint spots. 

(d) Total length, 6 feet 11 inches. Color gray. Numerous irregular small spots of 
white snd single white hairs. No dark spots. 

(e) Total length, 6 feet 10 inches. Color pale tawny. Numerous white hairs. Faint 
spots on the legs only.

give the following dimensions of a male killed by J. W. Audubon at 
Castroville, Tex., January 28, 1846, From point of nose to root of tail 
(whether measured along curves, not stated), 5 feet 1 inch; tail, 3 feet 
1 inch; height of ear posteriorly, 3 inches.* 

The male Puma measured by Azara was somewhat smaller, the head 
and body being 51£ inches and the tail 29 inches.! The system of 
measurement is not given. 

The average dimensions obtained from these three individuals are: 
For the head and body, oo^- inches, and for the tail, 304 inches ; total, 
85 inches.

594 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

specimen mentioned above. The total length in that case was 8 feet 2 
inches. There are, however, records of measurements of flat skins of 
greater size.* I have myself measured a skin from Colorado in the 
National Museum, (No. 19906), of which the total length in a straight 
line is 8 feet 4 inches. Mr. Livingston Stone states that the skin 
of a Puma killed on the McOloud River, California, " measured 8i 
feet when stretched."t The average total length of nine flat skins of 
adults iri the possession of Mr. F. S. Webster, of Washington, is 7 feet 
4 inches. 

The area over which the Puma ranges extends from New England and 
British Columbia to the Straits of Magellan. On the Atlantic coast of 
North America the species has apparently not been found in the States 
of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, or Delaware. On our 
northern boundary I find no mention of its having been found in Michi- 
gan or Indiana. In Ohio it was extirpated prior to 1838, and probably 
more recently in Illinois and Indiana. I find no record of its occur- 
rence in Nevada, but as it has been found in the surrounding States it 
seems improbable that it should be entirely absent here. 

With these exceptions there are recorded instances, more or less nu- 
merous, of the occurrence of the Puma in every State and Territory of 

* Since this was written. Prof. C. L. Bristol, of Vermillion, South Dakota, has sent 
me a letter addressed to him by Mr. James G. Needliam, taxidermist of Galesburgh, 
Illinois, in winch the writer states that he knows of several mounted specimens in 
which the head and body taken together exceed 60 inches in length, and that he has 
recently mounted one from near Lake Valley, New Mexico, a fine dark skin, which 
measured 70 inches from the nose to the root of the tail. The tail was 39 inches long, 
and the total length 109 inches. 

t Forest and stream, xix, 1882, p. 208. 

Anonymous and pseudonymous writers in the various natural history and sporting 
journals give still larger dimensions. Thus we read of a Puma killed at Lauder, in 
Wyoming Territory, which measured " 10 feet from tip to tip " (American Field, XXIV. 
1885, p. 486) and even of one from Colorado that was 11 feet 3 inches long (" S. C. C." 
Forest and Stream, xix, 1882, p. 127). 

While it is well known that giants, which greatly exceed ordinary individuals in 
size, exist among many kinds of animals, it is necessary that statements regarding 
them in order to receive credence should be accompanied by unquestionable proofs. 
The best vouchers are the skins and skulls of the specimens preserved in museums. 
The cases cited above are not properly vouched for. It may be said, furthermore, 
that among the twenty skulls of Pumas iu the National Museum there is none which 
by the most liberal calculation could be supposed to belong to an individual exceed- 
ing 8| feet in total length. The greatest length of the largest skull, (No. 1158, from 
Prairie Mer Rouge, Louisiana), is 8| inches, and its basilar length, that is, from the 
back of the incisor teeth to the front edge of the foramen magnum, 6* iuches. 

Iu recording measurements of fresh specimens, it should always be stated whether 
the line is allowed to follow the curves of the back or whether the measurements are 
made in straight lines. It should also be remembered, as regards measurements of 
total length, that an individual with a well-developed body, but a short tail, may ap- 
pear to be a smaller and feebler animal thau one with a long tail, when the contrary 
may in reality be the truth.

the Union, dating from the beginning of the century. Like many other 
large American animals, however, the Puma has retired before the ad 
vance of civilization, and in many of the more thickly populated States 
it is improbable that even stragglers could be found at the present day.* 



* The localities in tlie several States and Territories in which individuals have been 
captured or seen, so far as they are recorded in the literature at coniniaud, are given 
in the following list : 

Upper Canada.— A specimen from this region was seen by Audubon. (Audubon and 
Bachman, Quadrupeds of North America, n, 1851, p. 312. ) A second specimen was 
killed near the city of Ottawa. (William Couper, in Forest and Stream, vm, 1677, pp. 
299,300. Communicated by Dr. Elliott Coues.) King reports having seen one which 
was killed by Dr. Maitland near St. Catherine's. (King, Sportsman and Naturalist 
in Canada, 1866, p. 16.) There is an improbable narration of a Puma having at- 
tempted to attack some men in a boat near St. Francis on the St. Lawrence River, 
in Small's Animals of North America, 1864, p. 49. The size, weight, and other par- 
ticulars are, however, given. 

Manitoba. — The Puma is not included by Mr. E. E. Thompson in his recent list of 
the mammals of Manitoba. (Trans. Manitoba Sci. & Hist. Soc., No. 23, May, 1886.) 

British Columbia. — Abundant in Vancouver's Island, and ranges to 56° north latitude 
in British Columbia, according to J. C. Hughes. (Forest and Stream, xxi, p. 103.) 

Alabama. — Hallock states that the Puma is occasional in De Kalb County. (Sports- 
man's Gazetteer, 1877, p. 3.) 

Arizona. — Generally distributed, but found most frequently in the wooded and 
mountainous portions of the Territory. (Coues, American Naturalist, i, 1867, pp. 
281-292.) Drs. Coues aud Yarrow killed two specimens in the Triplet Mountains. 
(Wheeler's Survey, v, Zoology, 1875, pp. 40,41). Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, TJ. S. Army, 
has kindly given me measurements of nineteen Pumas killed by him in Arizona 
between December, 1884, and February, 1888. Four were killed near Fort Verde ; six, 
in the Mogollon Mountains; four, at the head of Beaver Creek, Yavapai County ; and 
five, on the Verde River. 

Arkansas. — Nuttall reported the occurrence of the Puma on the Arkansas River, 
north of Little Rock, in 1819. (Travels into Arkansas Territory, 1821, p. 118.) Mr. 
Hallock states that the dense caue-brakes, swamps, and forests of Cross County are 
infested by Pumas. They are occasionally found also in the dense caue-brakes along 
the Red River, in Jackson County, and great numbers in Prairie County, in the cane- 
brakes between the White and Cache Rivers; also in Phillips Couuty, in the vicin- 
ity of Helena, in the woods; in Pulaski County, near Little Rock ; aud in St. Francis 
County. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 1877, pp. 8, 9.) One is reported to have been killed 
near Bayou Bartholomew, in Jefferson County, in 1883. {Forest and Stream, xx, 1883, 
p. 125.) There is also an acconut of a hunt on Crooked Bayou in the southeastern 
part of the State in 1887 in Forest and Stream, wyiii, 1887, p. 323. 

California. — Abundant throughout the State, as appears from the statements of 
various authors. Mr. H. W. Henshaw. however, stated in 1875 that the species had 
apparently disappeared from the lower and more thickly settled portions. (W'heeler's 
Survey, Report of 1876, pp. 305-312.) Mr. Hallock mentions the Puma as occurring 
in 1877 in Butte, Humboldt, Klamath, Trinity, Mendocino, Los Angeles, Marin, 
Nevada, Santa Clara, Shasta, Siskiyou, Sonoma, and Tehama Counties. (Sports- 
man's Gazetteer, 1877, pp. 11-18. ) Specimens were obtained in Shasta < lounty iu 1884 
by Mr. C. H. Towusend. See also Forest and Stream, xtx, 1882, p. 208; xx, 1883,

596 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Colorado. — Common in Park County in 1874, according to Dr. J. A. Allen. (Bull. 
Essexlnst., vi, 1874, pp. 43-66). Elsewhere in the mountains, according toDrs. Cones 
and Yarrow. (Report Wheelers Survey, v, 1875, pp. 35-129.) Mr. Hallock states 
that they occur in the North Park, in Summit County. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 1877, 
p. 22.) Three specimens were received from Canon City in 1877 by the National 
Museum. See also Forest and Stream, xxx, 1888, p. 243 (Rifle Creek). 

Connecticut. — Linsley, in 1842, saw a specimen reported to have heen killed in the 
northern part of the State. (Amer. Journ. ScL, xliii, 1842, pp. 345-354.) 

Dakota. — Mr. G. B. Grinnell saw a single individual in the Black Hills in 1874, but 
believed them to be quite numerous in that region. (Ludlow, Rep't of a Reconnais- 
sance of the Black Hills, 1874, pp. 77-85.) Mr. Vernon Bailey also learned in 1887 
that they were considered quite common in the Black Hills, and saw a young one 
which ha«i been captured there. (Rep't Ornithologist, Dept. Agric, 1888, p. 431.) 
Hoffman reported in 1877 that specimens were occasionally captured in the oak groves 
on Oak Creek in the vicinity of Grand River. (Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., xix, 
1877, pp. 94-102.) 

Florida.— Dr. J. A. Allen stated in 1870 that the Puma was not uufrequent in the 
more unsettled parts of the State. (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zoology, n, 1870, p. 186.) May- 
nard in 18^3 reported that it was common in the interior and more southern parts of 
the State, but was not fouud on the Keys. (Quart. Journ. Boston Zool. Soc, n, 1883, 
Nos. 1-4.) The late Mr. Judson, however, writing under the pseudonym of "Ned 
Buntline," reported that a Puma was captured on Key Largo. (Forest and Stream, 
XIII, 1880, p. 994.) See also a note on one killed in Manatee County in 1887, in Amer- 
ican Field, xxvin, 1887, p. 7. 

Georgia. — Fouud along the water-courses in this State thirty years ago, according 
to Audubon. (Audubon and Bachman, Quadrupeds of North America, n, 1851, p. 312.) 
According to Mr. Hallock the scream of the Puma is not uncommonly heard in Barlow 
County and in the hill country generally ; also in Thomas County, in the vicinity of 
McDonald. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 1877, pp. 37-40.) 

Idaho. — Mr. Hallock reported in 1877 that Pumas could be found in the mountains 
and forests of Idaho County. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 1877, p. 42.) A person writing 
under the pseudonym of " Nica" reports that he killed a Puma in Northern Idaho in 
1888. (Forest and stream, xxx, 1888, p. 308.) 

Illinois. — Keunicott in 1855 stated that a single individual had been known to occur 
in Cook County. (Trans. Illinois State Agric. Soc, i, 1855, pp. 577-580.) The species 
has probably disappeared from the State. Professor Leidy calls attention to a fossil 
skull found 30 feet below the surface, in the bed of the Kaskaskia River, in Proc. 
Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1888, p. 9. 

Indiana. — I have not met with any mention of the occurrence of the Puma in this 
State. Haymond omits it from his list of mammals observed in Franklin County in 
1869, published in the Report of the Geological Survey of Indiana for that year. 

Indian Territory. — Woodhonse in 1853 remarks of this species : " It was observed in 
the Indian Territory in the neighborhood of a swamp." He does not give the loca- 
tion of the swamp. (Sitgreaves, Exped. down the Zuni and Colo. Rivers, 1853, p. 47.) 

Iowa. — Dr. C. A. White writes in 1869 as follows: "The panther has been known 
within our limits but very rarely." (Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., xm, 1869, p. 181, 
foot-note. ) 

Kansas.— Accordiug to Mr. F. W. Cragin, four Pumas were captured and three 
others seen in the counties of Harper, Barbour and Comanche in the winter of 
1884-'85. (Bull. Washburn Laboratory of Nat. Hist., i, 1885, p. 42.) 

Kentucky. — I am obliged to Prof. John R. Procter, director of the geological survey 
of Kentucky, for a letter regarding the occurrence of the Puma in Kentucky, written 
at his request by Mr. K. T. Durrett, of Louisville. On the authority of manuscripts 
in his possession, Mr. Durrett states that John Sanders killed a Puma in a, chestnut- 
oak tree at the Knobs, i\ or 7 miles south of Louisville, in 1784. A young Butna was 



THE PUMA, OR AMERICAN LION. 597 

killed ou Mr. Durrett's father's farm, in Allen Comity, 1>\ a negro, in 1815. The 
Puma was last, seen in Kentucky in 1863, when a full-grown individual, having a total 
length of7feet, and weighing 111 pounds, was killed by Mr. John Custis and others, 
within 6 miles of Lexington. 

There is also mention of two or three killed near Reeder in American Field, xxm, 
1385, p. 174. 

Louisiana. — A skull from Prairie Mer Rouge, obtained by .lames Fairie, in 1853, is 
in the National Museum. Baird includes the Puma in his list of the mammals of the 
Red River of Louisiana. (Marcy's Exploration of the Red River of Louisiana, 1853, 
Appendix P.) See also American Field, xxviii, 1887, 390 (Red River). Mr. Hallock 
states in 1877 that Pumas were to be found in Grant Parish, about Flagon, Clear, 
Big, and Trout Creeks. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 1877, p. 62.) 

Maine. — Included without comment in Holmes's list of the mammals of the State, 
in the sixth annual report of the Maine board of agriculture, 1861, p. 123. lam 
credibly informed that no Pumas have been killed iu the State in recent years. 

Maryland. — The species formerly occurred here, according to Audubon and Bach- 
niau. (See Quadrupeds of North America, II, 1851, p. 312.) It is included by Scott 
among the indigenous animals of the State, under the name of Panther. (Joseph 
Scott, A Geog. Descript. of the States of Maryland and Delaware, 1807, p. 28.) 

Massachusetts. — Emmons states that the Puma was not to be found here in 1840, 
though it existed in the State at an earlier day. (Emmons, Report on the Quadru- 
peds of Massachusetts, 1840, p. 36.) Dr. J. A. Allen, in 1869, writes: "The Panther 
has probably been for some time extinct in Massachusetts, though undoubtedly once 
occurring here." (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., i, 1863-1869. p. 153.) There was a rumor 
that one was seen near East Douglass as late as 1883. See Forest and stream, xx, 
1883, p. 48. 

Michigan. — No record was found of its occurrence iu this State. It is not mentioned 
in a list of the vertebrates of the State, published by M. Miles, M. D., about 1861. 
(Presumably in the report of the geological survey of the State for that year. I 
have seen only au undated excerpt.) 

Minnesota. — Not included in Head's list of mammals found in the vicinity of Fort 
Ripley in 1854. (Smithsonian Report, 1854, p. 291.) Mr. Frank J. Locke makes the 
following statement: "I recently had a bloodless encounter with a huge panther 
the only one seen iu this locality for years." (Forest and Stream, xx, 1883, p. 226.) 

Mississippi. — Audubon states, in 1851, that the Puma was to be found in the swamps 
of this State, and relates several adventures with it in the region of the Yazoo River. 
(Quadrupeds of North America, II, 1851, p. 308.) Wailes, in 1854, writes: "The 
Panther is now rarely met with except iu dense and extensive swamps and cane- 
brakes." (Report on the Geology of Mississippi, 1854, p. 315.) Mr. Hallock states 
in 1877 that there was an excellent region for Pumas in Tunica County, at Hudson, 
near the Mississippi River; also in Washington County. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 
1877, p. 92.) See also an improbable story in Forest and Stream, xx, 1883, p. 125. In 
this connection, the remarks of Du Prat/, a writer of the last century, are of interest. 
Dn Pratz appears to have established himself near Natchez. Writing in 1758, he says 
of the Puma or Tigre : "One sees them but little ; and if this auimal was as common 
as a certain author (? Buff on) would have us believe, the ancient inhabitants of the 
country would have seen a certain number, but I have never heard mention of but 
one. I have seen two at different times about my habitation." (M. Le Page Du 
Pratz, Histoire de la Louisiaue, u, 1758, pp. 91-92.) 

Missouri. — I found uo records of the occurrence of the Puma in this State since the 
beginning of the century, wheu Dr. J. Watkins, in a letter to Dr. Bartou, included 
it amoDg the mammals found in the country west of St. Louis. (Trans. Amer. 
Philos. Soc, vi, 1809, pp. 69-72.) 

Montana. — The Puma occurs in congenial localities throughout the Territory. It 
was seen by Mr. G. B. Grinnell at the mouth of Alum Creek in 1875. (Reconnaissance 



598 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

from Carroll, Montana, to Yellowstone Nat. Park in 1875, by Win. Ludlow, 1875, pp. 
63-72.) A Puma from Fort Keogh is living in the Smithsonian park at this date. 
See also Forest and Stream, xxvi, 1886, p. 508: xxx, 1888, pp. 411, 350. Mr. Vernou 
Bailey found the Puma at Tilyou's Ranch, Dawson County, in 1887. (Rep't Orni- 
thologist, Dep't Agriculture, 1888, p. 431.) 

Nebraska. — Aughey remarks regarding the Puma in this State: "I have only seen 
it a few times on the Niobrara and the Loup." (S. Aughey, Geology of Nebraska, 
1880, p. 119.) 

Nevada. — I have found no distinct record of its occurrence in this State. 

New Hampshire. — No evidence found of its occurrence in this State. 

New Jersey. — Omitted by Beesley from his list of the wild animals of Cape May 
County (Geology of the County of Cape May, 1857, p. 137) and by Abbott from his 
list, of the mammals of the State published in the Report of the Geological Survey of 
New Jersey, 1868, pp. 751-761. 

Neiv Mexico. — Bartlect found the Puma along the water courses of this Territory 
thirty-five years ago, (Narrative of Explorations in Texas, New Mexico, etc., n, 
1853, p. 555&.) Woodhouse states that the Puma was observed in the mountains of 
New Mexico. He also in another place states that its cry was heard on the San Fran- 
cisco Mountains. (He calls it Felis partialis.) (Woodhouse in Sitgreaves's Exped. 
down the Zufli and Colorado Rivers, 1853, pp. 37 and 47.) Drs. Coues and Yarrow 
reported in 1875 that the Puma was tolerably common in the mountains of Colorado, 
New Mexico, and Arizona. (Rep't Wheeler's survey, v, 1875, pp. 35-129.) Mr. J. 
Preston True states that his guide killed a Puma at Albuquerque in 1888. (Forest 
and Stream, xxx, 1888, pp. 350, 411. See also Forest and Stream, xn, 1879, p. 294, 
and American Field, xx, 1883, p. 201.) 

New York. — The Puma is still found in the Adirondack Mountains. Dr. C. H. Mer- 
riam gives a list of forty-six killed in that region between 1871 and 1881, and esti- 
mates that nearly a hundred were killed between 1860 and 1882. (Trans. Liuuean 
Society of New York, I, 1882, p. 39.) DeKay stated, in 1842, that the species was oc- 
casionally seen in the Catskill Mountains. (Nat. Hist, of New York, Zoology, 
1842, pp. 47, 48.) He also remembered the appearance of one in AYestchester County, 
within 25 miles of New York City, when a boy, and was informed that one had been 
killed in Warren County. See also Forest and Stream, xxm, 1884, pp. 4 and 264; 
xxv, 1885, p. 286; vi. 1876, 138 (Lewis County); x, 1878, p. 138 (Fulton Lakes). 

North Carolina and South Carolina. — Andubon, in 1851, stated that it was occasion- 
ally killed along the water-courses of these States. (Audubon and Bachmau, Quad- 
rupeds of North America, ii, 1851, p. 312.) I liud no reference to its occurrence 
here at a later date. Dr. Merriam in 1888 reported that the Panther was unknown 
in the Great Smoky Mountain region of Tennessee and North Carolina. (Amer. 
Jour. Science, xxxvi, 1888, p. 459.) 

Ohio. — Kirtland stated, in 1838, that the Puma was formerly found in Ohio, but 
had disappeared. He mentions specimens in Dorfeuille's Museum in Cincinnati. 
(Rep't Geol. Survey of Ohio, 1838, p. 176.) Later writers do not include the species. 

Oregon. — Suckley and Gibbs, in 1859, reported the Puma common in Oregon and 
Washington, and abundant in the mountains of the Klamath River. (Nat. History 
of Wash. Territory, U. S. Pacific R. R. Survey, 1859.) Mr. Hallock mentions that 
Pumas were numerous in Josephine County, in 1877. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 1877, 
p, 138.) See also Forest and Stream, xxvn, 1887, p. 104 (near Puget Sound). 

Pennsylvania. — Audubon stated that the Puma was abundant at the headwaters of 
the Juniata River in 1851. (Audubon and Bachmau, Quadrupeds of North America, 
ii, 1851, p. 311.) McMurtrie states that a woman was killed by a Puma in Pennsyl- 
vania in January, 1830. (Cuvier's Animal Kingdom, i, 1831, p. 115.) (See also Forest 
and Stream, in, 1874, p. 67. Berks County). Mr. Hallock states that Pumas were to 
be found in Cambria County, near Ebensburgh, in 1877; also in Elk County, near 
Ridgway. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 1877, p. 140.) Mrs. B. H. Warren writes me that 






THE PUMA, OR AMERICAN LION. 599 

a Puma was killed iu the northeastern part of the State aboul fifteen years ago, and 

adds: " li is asserted by apparently reliable persons (hunters) that a few of these 
are yet to be found in Cameron and Potter Counties." 

Rhode Island. — No record of its occurrence in this State lias been found. 

South Carolina. — See North Carolina. 

Tennessee.— Heywood, in his Early History of Tennessee, mentions the Puma as 
among the wild animals of the State. Mr. Hallock states in 1877 that the cane- 
breaks of Shelby county afforded fine grounds for hunting Pumas. (Sportsman's 
Gazetteer, 1877, p. 153.) There is a report that a Puma was killed on Wheatley's 
plantation, 8 miles south of Memphis, in the Chicago Field, Xlir, 1880, p. 11. (See North 
Carolina). 

Texan. — Common all over rhe State in 1889, according to Professor Cope. (Bull. IT. 
S. Nat. Mus., No. 17, 1880, p. '.».) There are specimeus in the National Museum from 
Eagle Pass and the Brazos River, collected respectively in 18513 and 1857. 

Utah. — The Puma, according to Dr. J. A. Allen, is not common, but quite generally 
distributed in the Great Salt Lake valley. (Bull. Essex Inst., VI, 1874, pp. 43-6G.) 
Drs. Cones and Yarrow state that they occur in eastern and middle Utah but are not 
numerous. (Rept. Wheeler's Survey, V, Zoology, 1875, p. 40.) 

Vermont. — Thompson mentions a Puma killed iu Manchester in 1850, and states 
that the species had become very rare at that time. He knew of one killed in Rox- 
bury iu 1821. (Z. Thompson, Nat. Hist, of Vermont, 185::. p. 38; Appendix, p. 12.) At 
an earlier time one was killed in Bennington. It had taken a calf out of a pen where 
the fence was 4 feet high. (Williams's History of Vermont, 171I4, pp. 86, 87.) Dr. J. A. 
Allen saw a specimen which was killed on Pine Hill, Weathersfield, in 1867. (Bull. 
Mus. Comp. Zool., i, 1863-1869, p. 153.) A Puma was reported killed in West Wards- 
boro' in 1875, and another near Brattleboro' in 1885. (See Forest and stream, V, 1875, 
p. 300, and xxv, 1885, p. 306.) 

Virginia, — A specimen was received from Capon Springs in 1850 by the Natioual 
Museum. Mr. Hallock makes the very interesting statement that the Puma is found 
in the Dismal Swamp. I find no other reference to its occurrence in the low coast 
lands of the South Atlantic States, except in Florida. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 1877, 
p. 167.) 

Washington. — Dr. Cooper pronounced it very common in 1S59. He mentions one 
captured while swimming in the Columbia River. (Nat. Hist. Washington Territory, 
1859, j». 74.) A specimen collected by Dr. George Gibbs in 1855 was received from 
Fort Steilacoom by the Natioual Museum. Dr. Suckley, in 1859, reported the species 
especially abundant in Cowlitz, Chehalis, and Nisqually Counties. (L. c, p. 108.) 
There are references to its occurrence in Cedar Mountain, Black RUer, and White 
River, at recent dates. (See Forest and Stream, XXX, 1888, p. 308; American Field, 
xxi, 1884, p. 302.) 

West Virginia. — I am in possession of a letter from Mr. W. II. Hill, of Gurley Bridge, 
to Mr. Randolph I. Geare, dated August 14, 1890, in which if is stated that six or more 
Pumas have been killed in Webster County during the last eight or ten years, and 
that it has been ascertained from reliable sources that, Pumas now infest the wilds of 
the Alleghany range in the Counties of Randolph and Webster, and are also to bo 
found in Logan County, near the Cumberland ranee, individuals have also been 
taken in the Counties of Randolph and Greenbrier. 

Wisconsin. — Lapham, on the authority of Dr. Hoy, refers to it as occurring m north- 
ern Wisconsin, in his catalogue of the animals of the State, published in 1852. ( Fauna, 
and Flora of Wisconsin, prepared for the State Agricultural Society, p. 339.) 

Wyoming. — Dr. J. A. Allen, in 1874, writes of the Puma as follows: " More or less 
common in the timber of the Medicine Bow Range, as it is also throughout the tim- 
bered portions of the Rocky Mountains." (Bull. Essex Inst., vi. 1874, pp. 13-66.) 
According to Mr. Hallock it was to be found, in 1877, in Laramie and Sweetwater 
Counties. (Sportsman's Gazetteer, 1877. p. 181.) 



600 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The Puma occurs throughout Ceutral America* and in all parts of 
South America to the Straits of Magellan. f 

The first mention of the Puma appears to be the remark in the letter 
of Columbus regarding his fourth voyage in 1502. In the narrative of 
his exploration of the coast of Honduras and Nicaragua he writes: 
" I saw some very large fowls (the feathers of which resemble wool), 
lions [leones], stags, fallow-deer, and birds.| 

There are also references to the occurrence of the Puma in North 
America of very early date in the narratives of Laudonniere, Hariot, 
Coronado, Hawkins || and others. 

The Puma, regarded as a species, possesses in a remarkable degree 
the power of adapting himself to varied surroundings. He endures 
severe cold during the winter in the Adirondack Mountains § and other 
parts of our northern frontier, and tracks his prey in the snow. He is 
equally at home in the hot swamps and canebrakes along the river- 
courses of our southern States.^] In South America he inhabits the 
treeless, grass-covered pampas as well as the forests.** In the Rocky 
Mountains, as I am informed by Mr. William T. Hornaday, he ascends 
to thehigh altitudes in which the mountain sheep are found. Mr. Living- 
ston Stoue saw tracks of the Puma on the summit of Mount Persephone 
in California, at an elevation of 3,000 feet.tt Similarly, Darwin states 
that he saw the footprints of the Puma on the cordillera of central 
Chili, at an elevation of at least 10,000 feet4J According to Tschudi,

THE PUMA, OE AMERICAN LION. 601 

tlie Puma is found in Peru iu the highest forests and even to the snow 
line (though seldom here).* A writer in the Encyclopaedia Britannica I 
states that "in Central America it is still common in the dense forests 
which clothe mountain ranges as high as 8,000 or 9,000 feet above the 
sea-level." 

In these different regions the Puma always selects for his abode such 
spots as afford some shelter, but we find him iu the thickets and copses, 
rather than in the great forests.! " Those panthers that we have ob- 
served," writes one of the naturalists of the Mexican Boundary Survey, 
"were always found iu the most solitary places, generally where there 
were thick bushes, and in the vicinity of rocky spots, affording caverns 
for secure concealment, and in which to bring forth their young." || 

The Puma seeks his prey chietiy at dawn and twilight and under cover 
of night, but he also sometimes hunts by day. The different species of 
American deer are his principal quarry, but he preys also upon smaller 
mammals. He will even feed upon the different species of American 
porcupines, despite their quills, which lacerate his mouth and face.§ 
Audubon and Bachman state that raccoons and skunks, as well as birds, 
form a part of his food, and that he will eat carrion when hard pressed 
by hunger/] To this list Brehin adds the South American Coati,** 
Agouti ft and Paca,|| and the Ehea, or American ostrich. |||| Drs. Coues 
and Yarrow state that in New Mexico and Arizona the Puma kills hun- 
dreds of wild turkeys and has indeed broken up many of the former 
breeding-places.§§ Pennant asserts that the wolf serves the Puma for 
prey. This is improbable. Nevertheless, he reports that there was in 
the Museum of the Boyal Society of London the skin of a Puma which 
was shot shortly after it had killed a wolf/]fl

attacks only the young, but he will carry away a full-grown sheep from 
the fold,* and not unfreqnently preys upon the llama in South America.! 

In the less settled portions of America the Puma has proved at times 
a great hindrance to stock raising.! Kennerly states that in Sonora, 
Mexico, it kills many colts and calves, and is poisoned with strychnine 
by the herdsmen. § Mr. C. H. Townsend remarks in 1887 : "It is practi- 
cally impossible to raise colts in the Shasta County hills, California, 
on account of these pests. They destroy many hogs and young cattle 
also, but do not present so serious an impediment to the keeping of 
these animals as in the case of horses." || I have recently received sim- 
ilar reports from other sources. 

The Puma does not ordinarily attack men, but ou the coutrary when 
surprised attempts to flee from them. Nevertheless it seems probable 
that some individuals, when strongly pressed by hunger, or moved by 
other unusual circumstances, may be emboldened to make such attacks. 
Hensel affirms that such is the case.ff Darwin states that he had heard 
of two men and a woman who were killed by Pumas in Chili.** Mc- 
Murtrie mentions that a woman was killed by a Puma in Pennsylvania, 
January, 1830. tt That the Puma sometimes kills the hunter who has

tit appears that the Puma received permission to kill llamas from the god Coni- 
raya. The tale of Coniraya's pursuit of the beautiful Cavillaca is thus narrated by 
Avila: " The god weut on and met a lion, which in reply to his question told him 
that he was very near the goddess Cavillaca, and that if he made a little more 
haste he would overtake her. This good news pleased the sage, and he blessed the 
lion saying : ' You shall be respected and feared by all, and I assign to you the office 
of punisher and executioner of evil doers; you may eat the Hamas of sinners, and after 
your death you shall still be honored ; for when they kill you and take your skin 
they shall do so without cutting off the head, which they shall preserve, with the 
teeth, and eyes shall be put in the sockets so as to appear to be still alive. Your feet 
shall remain haugingfrom the skin with the tail, and, above all, those who kill you 
shall wear your head over their own, and your skin shall cover them. This shall 
they do at their principal festivals, so that you shall receive honor from them. I 
further decree that he who would adorn himself with your skin must kill a llama on 
the occasion, and then dance and sing with you on his back." <^Narrative of Errors,

+t Commenting on Cuvier's statement, he remarks; "That this animal, our com- 
mon panther, does not always confine itself to sheep, etc., is well known, and has 
lately been proved, January, 1830, by an unprovoked attack upon an unfortunate 
woman in Pennsylvania. The ferocious brute seized upon her as she was passing 
along the road, and killed her in an instant." (McMurtrie, Cuvier's Animal Kingdom, 
I, 1831, p. 115.) 



THE PUMA, OR AMERICAN LION. 603 

wounded hun is doubtless true, as any wounded animal is likely to turn 
upon its persecutor, but this is quite different from an unprovoked 
assault.* 

It is the habit of the Puma to spring upon his prey from an emi- 
nence, such as a ledge of rock or a slight rise of ground. If he fails 
to strike his victim, he seldom pursues it for any considerable distance. 
In northern regions, however, he sometimes pursues the deer when 
they are almost helpless in the deep suow.t It was reported to Darwin 
that the Puma killed its prey by jumping upon the shoulder and turn- 
ing the head back with its paw until the vertebras of the neck are 
broken or dislocated. . Azara ascribes the same habit to the Jaguar.f 

The female brings forth her young in some secluded spot. In the 
Adirondacks, according to Dr. Merriam, " the lair is usually in a shal- 
low cavern on the face of some inaccessible cliff or ledge of rocks."|| 
" In the southern States," says Audubon, " where there are no caves 
or roeks, the lair of the Cougar is generally in a very dense thicket or 
in a cane-brake. It is a rude sort of bed of sticks, weeds, leaves, and 
grasses or mosses, and where the canes arch over it, as they are ever- 
green, their long pointed leaves turn the rain at all seasons of the 
year." § 

From two to five young are born at a time. Bartlett states that in 
captivity the number is usually two, but sometimes one. Their young 
are reared without difficulty .fl They are brought forth at the close of 
winter or early in spring in the Northern parts of the United States, || 
and at the beginning of summer in South America, that is at the end of 
December.** The period of gestation is from thirteen to fourteen 

* Catesby, in a generally judicious account of the Puma, remarks : " The smallest 
cur, in company with his master, will make him take to a tree, which they will climb 
to the top of with the greatest agility. The hunter takes this opportunity to shoot 
him, though with no small danger to himself, if not killed outright, for descending 
furiously from the tree he attacks the first in his way, either man or dog, which 
seldom escape alive." (Natural History of Carolina, II, 1743, p. xxv.) 

t Merriam, 1. c, p. 3*2. 

i Darwin, Voyage of the Beagle, p. 269; Azara, Quadriipedos de la Paraguay, I, 
1802, p. 93. These statements are in a measure corroborated by reliable writers on 
Asiatic mammals, who affirm that the tiger frequently kills its prey in the same 
manner. Sterudale remarks, however, that as the attack is usually made in the 
evening or at night, and very suddenly, it is not easy to determine the exact manner 
in which the prey is killed. He mentions having seen five cattle, killed by tigers, 
which had the neck dislocated. (Sterudale, Mammals of India, 1884, p. 174.) Dar- 
win saw skeletons of guanacos with the neck dislocated, which were believed to 
have been killed by Pumas.

weeks.* The young first open their eyes when nine or ten days old. 
Their total length when born is from 10 to 12 inches.! Dr. Merriain 
is of the opinion that in the Adirondacks the Puma does not breed 
oftener than once in two years.f 

The age which the Puma attains iu the state of nature is unknown. 
It may be remarked, however, that one lived iu the Zoological Garden 
at Frankfort, Germany, sixteen years, one month, and nine days. It 
died from injuries received by accident, October 13, 1878.|| Dr. W. A. 
Conklin states that the various species of cats live iu captivity fifteen 
or sixteen years, but show signs of decay at twelve years.§ 

Authoritative writers upon the habits of the Puma in North America 
agree that the adults do not commonly or frequently make use of trees 
except when traversing precipitous cliffs or when pursued by dogs. 
Under the latter circumstances they do not climb into a tree, but jump 
upon the nearest branch, even though it be at a cousiderable distance 
from the ground.^ Rengger, in his Travels in Paraguay, however, states 
that both the Puma and the Ocelot climb well, and that in the forest 
they make their flight not only on the ground, but also by springing from 
tree to tree.** He tells us in another place that he once saw a Puma 
chase a troop of monkeys through the forest by jumping from bough to 
bough among the trees.+f However incredible this may at first appear, 
it becomes less so when we consider the wonderful denseness of the 
South American forests, described by Humboldt and other writers. ft 

The Puma, like the cat, has the habit of scratching the bark of trees 
with its claws, for the purpose of sharpening or smoothing them. 
Having mentioned this habit as possessed by the Jaguar, Darwin 
writes: "Some such habit must also be common to the puma, for on

ninety-one days for a female kept in captivity in the Central Park menagerie, New

case of the Puma in the Zoological Gardens, London, in 1882. (Proc. Committee of 
Science, Zool. Soc. of London, Pt. II, 1832, p. 62.)

t! It may be observed that a writer in the Forest and Stream newspaper affirms that 
he saw a Puma climb a tree that had no limbs below thirty feet from the ground, and 
knew of another that climbed a straight tree with no limbs below thirty-five feet. 
He states, however, that both individuals were of small size. (Forest and Stream, 
xxx, 1888, p. 308. See also, pp. 289 and 512. ) Dr. Merriam informs us that the kittens 
sometimes climb trees in play. (Merriam, 1. c, p. 33.)

the bare, hard soil of Patagonia I have frequently seen scores so deep 
that no other animal could have made them."* 

Many reliable authorities are agreed that the Puma does not ordi- 
narily emit loud cries or screams,! but Kenuerly, one of the naturalists of 
the Mexican boundary survey, states that on one or two occasions the 
cry of the Puma was heard at a distance, and Schotb writes as follows : 
" After dark his mournful note is heard resounding through the soli- 
tudes of the deserts. The note, listened to once attentively, is apt to make 
a deep, lasting impression. The different native names, as pronounced 
in Spanish, sound very appropriately to the note, and it is likely that 
the cry of the animal forms the base of its names. The note itself is 
often several times repeated, with intervals of from two to four minutes. 
As night advances the cry is heard but rarely. " £ Bo also writes : " A 
Puma was killed on the Rio Bravo, between Fort Duncan and Laredo. 
During his struggle with the hunters and dogs he raised a terrible cry, 
twice or thrice, to express his rage, and perhaps also to give his family 
the notice of danger. " || Dr. J. A. Allen reports that he once heard 
the Puma's cry near his camp in Montgomery, Colorado.§ Eliot likewise 
states that he heard the cry of the puma at night, while camping on 
the St. John's Kiver, Florida. He did not, however see the animal.ff 
Darwin states that the Puma does not often utter cries. He writes: 
" It is a very silent animal, uttering no cry, even when wounded, and 
only rarely during the breeding season.** 

In captivity the Puma purrs when pleased, after the manner of the 
cat, and the female has been heard to utter a mewing sound. ft 

The flesh of the Puma is eaten by certain of the South American 

* Voyage of the Beagle, p. 136. Darwin is of the opinion that this practice is in- 
dulged in for the purpose of tearing away the ragged poiuts of the claws, and not 
for sharpening them.

tt A tame Puma was kept by Edmund Kean, the actor, as a pet. Its skeleton is now 
in the Museum of tin- Royal College, of Surgeons in London. Jardine gives some 
particulars about this individual. "The celebrated Kean possessed one which fol- 
lowed him loose, and was often introduced to company in his drawing room. We 
have frequently been in company with the animal which served for the accompany- 
ing illustration. It was extremely gentle and playful, and showed no symptoms of 
ferocity to the strangers who came to see it. Its motions were-all free and graceful, 
and it exhibited the greatest agility in leaping and swinging about the joists of a 
large unoccupied room in the old college of Edinburgh."

ing the night, toil allowed itself to be taken up by a watchman, without offering

THE PUMA, OR AMERICAN LION. 607 

Indiaus of Paraguay was " Giiazuard. Others called it u Yagiia-pita," 
meaning red Yagiia, or Yagiiati meaning white Yagiia.* 

The word " Paiuter" is a corruption of Panther. It is unfortunate 
that this latter name has gained general acceptance in the United States, 
since the true Panther is a spotted, Old World cat, very different in ap- 
pearance from the Puma. 

The name Mountain Lion is not altogether inappropriate, as the Puma 
somewhat resembles the female Lion in color and general form.t From 
the earliest days the Puma has been called the Lion (Leon) by Spanish 
Americans, and the name is still used. 

The names Catamount, or Catamountain, and Wild Cat have no special 
applicability to the Puma. They have been used by English writers to 
designate the European Wild Cat (Felts catus) and Lynxes, and by 
Americans have been applied to the Lynxes of this country. 

Besides those names which are in common use, there are some which 
have been invented from time to time by various authors, and are 
known to zoologists as " book-names." Button's name Couguar really 
belongs to this class, as do also the names Brazilian Cat (die brasilian- 



# Azara, Quadriipedos del ParagUay, I, 1802. p. 120. It another place, (1. c, p. 91) 
Azara states that the word Yagiia original!}' signified a dog. (A writer in the Ency- 
clopaedia Britaunica says "a big dog.") At the instigation of my friend Prof. O. T. 
Mason, Dr. A. Gatschet has kindly given me some very interesting information regard- 
ing the word Yagiid. "It appears," he writes, "that agoard was used in the Guarani 
language for all quadrupeds, or at least the wild ones, the dog heiug yagiid or agua- 
rati ; the wolf, agiiaraguaril (the large quadruped) ; the fox, aguard; the hear, agitata 
rami. In the cognate Tupi, jagua means tail, and as the initial / becomes deciduous, 
I infer that aguard means nothing else than ' having a tail.' Thus in Tonka we (Texas) 
a large number of birds and the smaller quadrupeds are also called after their tail 
(tan) and its length or other properties." 

tSome early writers, believing that the Puma was in truth the same as the Lion, 
were puzzled by the fact that all the skins appeared to be those of females, as they 
were without manes. Thus Adriaen van der Donck writes: "Although the New- 
Netherlands lay in a fiue climate, aud although the country in winter seems rather 
cold, nevertheless lions are found there, but not by the Christians, who have trav- 
ersed the laud wide and broad and have not seen one. It is only known to us by the 
skins of the females, which are sometimes brought in by the Indians for sale ; who on 
inquiry say, that the lious are found far to the southwest, distant fifteen or twenty 
days' journey, in very high mountains, and that the males are too active aud fierce 
to be taken." (Van der Donck, A Description of the New-Netherlands, 2d ed., 1656. 
Coll. N. Y. Hist. Soc, i, 1841, p. 167. See also De la Coudamine in Pinkerton's Col- 
lection of Travels, etc., XIV, 1813, p. 246.) 

Garcilasso de la Vega remarks of the land of theYncas: "Lions are met with, 
though they are not so large nor so fierce as those of Africa. The Indians call them 
Puma." (Royal Commentaries, n, book 8. Hakluyt Soc, vol. XLV, 18, p. 238.)

Tiger (Tigre Rouge of Barrere).t 

As already stared, the Puma is called the liou (Leon) by Spanish- 
Americans, while the Jaguar is styled the tiger (Tigre). Early Spanish 
writers, however, did not always distinguish between the two, aud some- 
times mentioned the Puma under the name of Tiger, or used the name 
in some modified form, as red tiger, etc.! Molina states that it is called 
Pagi in Chili,§ and according to Clavigero, it was known to the Mex- 
icans as Mitzli.W 

The Puma is the Felis concolor of Linnaeus.^ This name has been 
adopted by subsequent authors, almost without exception. Schreber, 
however, has two figures of the species in his work on mammals, one of 
which is styled Felis discolor** 

Molina, in 1782, gave it the name of Felis puma,W and Lesson, that of 
Felis unicolor. \%

ANIMALS RECENTLY EXTINCT OR THREATENED WITH 

EXTERMINATION, AS REPRESENTED IN THE COLLECTIONS 

OF THE U, S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 



By Fbedekic A. Lucas, 
Assistcmt Curator of the Department of Comparative Anatomy. 



It is not, perhaps, generally realized how extensive and how rapid 
are the changes that are taking place in almost the entire fauna of the 
world through the agency of man. Of course changes have perpetu- 
ally taken place in the past through the operation of natural causes, 
and race after race of animals has disappeared from the globe, but there 
is this wide difference between the methods of nature and man ; that the 
extermination of species by nature is ordinarily slow, and the place of 
one is taken by another, while the destruction wrought by man is rapid, 
ami the gaps he creates remain unfilled. 

Some of the more obvious causes of extermination are to be found iu 
the systematic killing of animals for their various products, the destruc- 
tion caused by domesticated animals introduced into new countries, and 
the bringing of wild land under cultivation. These are the more simple 
and apparent destructive forces at work, and those that most directly 
affect the larger animals, smaller creatures being influenced by smaller 
causes. Thus the erection of telegraph wires, especially in sparsely 
wooded regions, has proved very destructive to birds, and a more deadly 
though more restricted source of danger is found in lofty electric lights, 
against which the birds dash themselves during their nocturnal migra- 
tions. The extinction of the Itytina and Great Auk, the almost com- 
plete extirpation of the Bison, and the reduced numbers of the Walrus 
are good examples of destruction wrought directly by the hand of man, 
while in addition to such cases are the still more numerous instances of 
the very perceptible decrease of animals once abundant. Species used 
for food or otherwise of economic value suffer most, fashion affects some, 
some are necessarily destroyed for the protection of man and his do- 
mesticated animals, and others arc killed merely for sport. It has 
taken comparatively lew years to so reduce the untold millions of the

Passenger Pigeon that the bird is now unknown in localities where it 
once abounded. Year by year the Halibut is growing scarcer and 
scarcer, and year by year the Lobster canneries find an increasing diffi- 
culty in obtaining necessary supplies, while there is already a dearth of I 
Oysters in the once seemingly inexhaustible waters of Chesapeake 
Bay. The Atlantic Salmon is practically kept from extermination in 
the waters of the United States by the efforts of the U. S. Fish Commis- 
sion, and the same is true of the Shad in many localities, while much 
attention is being paid to the artificial cultivation of Cod in order to pre- 
serve the inshore fisheries.* 

One reason for this growing depletion is to be found in the common 
and fatal fallacy that because some animals exist in large numbers, the 
supply is unlimited and the species needs no protection, a belief that 
is usually acted upon until the species is verging on extinction. Unfor- 
tunately, too,those most directly interested in the preservation of game — 
using the term in the widest sense— are usually the most bitter opponents 
of any protective measures, especially if the change will produce even a 
temporary inconvenience. The proposed reduction in number and 
change in location of nets in a certain Canadian Salmon stream met 
with vigorous protests from the fishermen; yet, a few years after the 
passage and enforcement of laws making the alterations, the catch of 
fish had increased tenfold. Cases exactly similar to this may be met 
with everywhere, and any attempt to enforce a close season, allow fish 
free access to their spawning beds, or to protect them when there, is 
almost certain to meet with strenuous opposition from local pot hunters 
and fishermen. The Michigan pigeon-catchers insist that it does no 
harm to take Pigeons in the nesting seasou, provided traps or gnus are 
not used too near the breeding places; the Potomac fishermen complain 
bitterly because they are not allowed the privilege of preventing all 
Shad and Herring from ascending to the spawning ground ; and the lob- 
ster catchers and dealers object to laws prohibiting the capture and sale 
of Lobsters under a certain size. All this is short sighted in the last 
degree, and yet as previously stated, those who should be found on the 
side of the law are only too often arrayed against it. Fashion is prin- 
cipally concerned in the destruction of fur-bearing mammals and birds 
for millinery purposes, although alligators, crocodiles, and of late vari- 
ous reptiles have come into vogue for the manufacture of fancy leather, 
and the demand for "novelties" seems on the increase. In 1885 Pec- 
caries were so abundant in the counties of Medina, Uvalde, and Zavalla, 
Texas, that their well-worn trails were everywhere to be seen, while 

'During the winter of 1889-'90 about 130,000,000 eggs of Cod, Haddock, and Pollack 
were brought to the hatcheries of Gloucester and Wood's Holl. Previous labors of 
tbe Fish Commission are already bringing about visible results and young cod are 
now plentiful where they were previously scarce or even unknown. 

A somewhat amusing incident was the sending of young Cod from Plymouth, Mas- 
sachusetts, to Gloucester for identification, the Plymouth fisherman having forgotten 
what they looked like. 



ANIMALS RECENTLY EXTINCT. (!ll 

their favorite haunts could be readily picked out by the peculiar musky 
odor characteristic of these little animals. Shortly after this date, hog- 
skin goods being in favor, a price of fifty cents each was ottered for 
Peccary hides, with the result that by 1890 the Peccaries had become 
practically exterminated. 

A yearly record of the sales of some London firms would indicate 
quite clearly the whims of fashion, some of the present tendencies being 
shown by the fact that 30,000 monkey skins and 250,000 Australian 
" opossums" were disposed of at a single sale. Birds are auctioned off 
in still more extraordinary numbers and among the items of one sale were 
0,000 Birds of Paradise, 5,000 Impeyan Pheasants, 300,000 assorted skins 
from India, and 400,000*LTummingbirds, the number of birds disposed of 
at this one auction exceeding that contained in all the collections, public 
and private, of the United States, while one dealer in 1887 sold no less 
than 2,000,000 bird-skins. The fashionable seal-skin sacque demands a 
yearly slaughter of about 185,000 fur seals, but these figures seem small 
when compared with those representing the catch of the plebeian hair- 
seals, 875,000 of these being annually killed for oil and leather. 

At the principal localities where the northern Fur Seal occurs the kill- 
ing is regulated by law and there is little danger of the animal being 
exterminated, but the southern species has been so recklessly hunted 
at its breeding places on the coast of South America and in the Ant- 
arctic seas that a southern sealing voyage is now very much in the 
uature of a lottery, and few or no animals are now to be taken at local- 
ities that formerlv Yielded thousands of skins. 

To supply the world with ivory for a year necessitates the death of 
100,000 elephants, and if these were placed in single file they would 
make a procession over 180 miles long. If, however, Stauley is cor- 
rect, the death of the elephant is but a portion of the price paid for 
ivory, of which every pound weight has cost the life of a "man, woman 
or child," while "every twenty tusks have been obtained at the price 
of a district, with all its peoples, villages and plantations." 

The extermination of the buffalo over large areas of country was 
partly a matter of necessity in order that the land might be rendered 
available for stock-raising ; the wolf and coyote are poisoned for the 
preservation of sheep, and for a like cause the Tasmauian thylacine has 
been hunted to the verge of extinction. Following this necessary de- 
struction comes the unnecessary or unpremeditated but unavoidable 
loss caused by the domesticated animals which have replaced the origi- 
nal possessors of the soil. Such for example is the more or less com- 
plete extirpation of rattlesnakes that follows the introduction of hogs, 
and although this is a consummation most devoutly to be wished for, 
it is none the less a case in point. 

The sentimental importation of birds by colonists is another piece of 
mischief, and is proving very detrimental to the interesting avifauna 
of New Zealand and the Sandwich Islands, where, as in our own coun- 
try, the English sparrow is largely instrumental in crowding out native 



612 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

species. The direct harm done is best seen where the smaller species, 
such as goats, dogs, cats, and hogs have been introduced into small 
islands destitute of carnivorous mammals, and where most of the birds 
are tame and many species ground dwellers. One of the most inter- 
esting birds uow being rapidly destroyed by imported animals is the 
New Zealand kiwi, which is preyed upon by dogs, and especially by 
cats, whose small size enables them to pursue the kiwi through the 
dense bush of its favorite haunts, while the nocturnal habits of both 
briug them out in search of food at the same time. Very rarely an an- 
imal seems to learn wisdom by experience and escape destruction 
by change of habit, but such instances are rare, although among them 
is the case of the Samoan tooth-billed pigeon {Diduncidus striyiros- 
tris) which formerly bred on or near the ground, and was so greatly 
reduced in numbers by cats as to be threatened with extermination. 
Eventually the bird took to nesting and roosting in trees and has since 
been gradually on the increase. 

Among the larger and more striking animals whose threatened ex- 
tinction is largely due to the rifle of the sportsman, is the true ze'>ra, 
now confined to a small area, in South Africa : and the giraffe is rapidly 
disappearing from the same cause. The decrease of our own large 
game is well kuowu; our only parrot, the Carolina parrakeet, will 
probably be extirpated in Florida by visitors, and the eastern pinnated 
grouse is restricted to the island of Nantucket, although long ago laws 
were framed for the protection of the "Heathen," as the compositor 
caused the bill to read. The clearing and cultivation of laud operates 
directly and indirectly in a variety of ways, and is by no means an 
unmitigated evil to the wild animals affected by it, being fatal to 
some and directly beneficial to others. The larger, more dangerous, 
or more gregarious quadrupeds are naturally the first to disappear, but 
smaller animals on the contrary, and especially birds, profit by the de- 
struction of their natural enemies and the food furnished by cultivated 
fields aud become more numerous. 

Thus in western Kansas the jack-rabbits are on the increase owing 
to the fact that the bounty on coyotes is two dollars while the price of 
a rabbit's scalp is only five cents, a difference of value that has resulted 
in the rapid decrease of the rabbits' natural check, the coyote. West- 
ern Kansas, too, affords another, and most excellent illustration of the 
direct influence of population upon the decrease or increase of the 
larger animals. Up to 1884 the region just mentioned was very 
sparsely settled, antelope were comparatively abundant and mule deer 
were frequently to be seen. During 1885 and 1886, under the mistaken 
impression that western Kansas was suitable for farming purposes, 
there came a tide of immigration from the east, and before the rising 
wave of increasing population the mule deer disappeared entirely and 
the antelope became extremely scarce. The country, so far as farming 
was concerned, having been tried and found wanting, an ebb tide of eini

^ration took place, and as the farms were abandoned by man, their 
former occupants again took possession, and by 1888 and 1800 antelope 
became not uncommon, while the mule deer appeared in localities 
where none had been seen for years. The felling of forests, burning- over 
of land, and draining of swamps are the grosser factors of agriculture, 
and produce some of the more evident changes, but other far-reaching 
though indirect results follow the alterations thus made in physical 
character and food supply. A good example of local extermination 
is to be seen in the Virgin Islands, where the land mollnsks were com- 
pletely destroyed by the practice of burning over the land, and only dead 
shells remain to show their former abundance in that locality. Drainage 
and extended cultivation have driven many birds from Great Britain in 
spite of efforts to retain them, including the wild goose, crane, and bus- 
tard, while clearing away forests about the headwaters of streams has an 
important bearing on the decrease of front, whose favorite spawning- 
grounds are thereby dried up. Other fish are destroyed, driven out, 
or prevented from entering streams by the pollution of water caused 
by sewerage and factories, by the erection of impassable dams, and, in 
some cases, by the sediment caused by hydraulic mining on a large 
scale. In fact, almost every accompaniment of civilization has some 
ett'ect on wild animals. Telegraph wires kill thousands of birds on the 
prairies and electric lights are equally destructive in cities, and so in 
various ways the ranks of the wild animals are becoming rapidly thinned 
out. Although regret at the impending or actual extermination of a 
species is often purely a matter of sentiment, there is no lack of in- 
stances where the strictest utilitarian is quite as much interested as 
the naturalist in the preservation of a species from destruction. The 
pity of it is that in so many cases a small amount of protection would 
not only preserve for the naturalist the animals he wishes to study, but 
furnish the " practical 1 ' man with an additional source of wealth. 

The following papers are based on some of the specimens contained 
in the collections of the IT. S. National Museum, and their object is to 
note a few of the more important or interesting animals that have re- 
cently become extinct, or whose extermination seems imminent, and to 
show the cause of their destruction. This, in nearly every instance, is 
reckless slaughter by man, and although species have occasionally be- 
come extinct in recent times from natural causes, such cases are the 
exception and not the rule. Of necessity these accounts have been 
gathered from various sources, the most important of which are given, 
but it may be said that although so largely compilations, they contain 
in a condensed form information that is widely scattered, and often not 
readily accessible.* In many cases the works referred to contain very 
full bibliographies of the animals under consideration.

614 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

THE WEST INDIAN SEAL. 
( Monach us trop ica I is. ) 

Toward the end of August, 1494, tlic flotilla of Columbus, who was 
cruising among the West India Islands iu the vain endeavor of finding 
a passage to the mythical province of Cipango, became scattered, and 
in the hope of catching sight of the missing caravels, the admiral came 
to anchor off the coast of Hayti, and sailors were sent to climb the rocky 
islet of Altii Vela and scan the horizon for sails. On their return the 
sailors came upon a band of ''sea wolves" asleep on the sands, and 
true to the instincts of the white race immediately proceeded to kill 
them, which they did to the number of eight. The "sea wolves" thus 
rudely made acquainted with the advent of civilization were specimens 
of the West Indian seal [Monachus tropical is), this species and its con- 
gener of the old world {Monachus albiventer) being the only members 
of the family of earless seals that dwell in warm latitudes. 

The general color of the West Indian seal is umber brown, tinged 
with gray from the light color of the tips of the hairs. The color be- 
comes lighter on the sides and the under surface is, in adult individu- 
als, more or less yellowish white. The newly born young are glossy 
black, and the coloration varies slightly with age. As in color, so also 
in its osteology, the West Indian seal presents a few features sag 
gestive of the otaries, or eared seals, while curiously enough there is 
an additional suggestion of that family in the animal's movements 
when on land. As is well known, the earless seals depend almost en- 
tirely on their fore limbs and abdominal muscles for terrestrial loco- 
motion, the hind flippers either trailing behind or being held stiffly ex- - 
tended and clear of the ground. On the other hand the otaries use all 
four feet in walking, the body being arched so as to completely clear 
I he ground, while the hind feet are directed outward and slightly for- 
ward. Progress is effected by drawing the hind feet up to the fore feet 
and thrusting these forward by straightening the body so that the 
sea! moves slowly ahead, not unlike a gigantic inch-worm. Now while 
the West Indian seal does not stand on all fours, the hind feet are 
brought forward by curving the body upward, when straightening 
itself the creature pitches ahead on its breast, advancing about a foot 
by the operation. The teeth of this seal are very powerful and seem 
quite as well adapted for crushing shells as for capturing fish, though 
unfortunately the stomachs of all that have been examined were empty 
and failed to throw any light on the favorite food of the animal. Like 
other seals the West Indian seal can go for a long time without food, I 
and one iu the possession of a Mr. Hill died only after a prolonged fast 
of four months, and even then the animal was very fat. We learn from 
Mr. Elliott that at the fur-seal rookeries of Alaska the males go three 
and occasionally four months without eating, although iu their case i 
they become much emaciated. The West Indian seal is a striking ex- \

ample of how little knowledge we may have of an animal whose exist- 
ence has been known lor centuries, and whose habitat is neither inac- 
cessible nor far from the habitations of civilized man. Thus, though 
the discovery of this seal is almost coeval with the discovery of Amer- 
ica, up to 1880 but a single specimen had fallen into the hands of nat- 
uralists, although for many years the animal must have been common 
in various portions of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, its range 
being from the Bahamas to the Gulf of Campeche. This very abun- 
dance was, however, the cause of its destruction, for the opportunity 
of prosecuting rhe seal fishery in a region where it could be carried on 
with comparatively little danger and throughout the entire year was 
too good to be neglected.

In 1675 Dampier notices a seal-fishery in operation at the Alacrane 
Islands, north of Yucatan, saying that : " Here are many seals ; they 
come up to sun themselves only on two or three of the Islands * * * 
the Spaniards do often come hither to make Oyl of their Fat; upon 
which account it has been visited by English-men from Jamaica, par- 
ticularly by Capt. Long: who, having the command of a small bark, 
came hither purposely to make Seal-Oyl, and anchored on the North side 
of one of the sandy Islands, the most convenient Place, for his design." 
Later on Captain Long discovered that although his anchorage might 
be conveniently located, it nevertheless possessed certain undesirable 
drawbacks, for one of the fierce " northers" that sweep across the Gulf 
of Mexico, came up and blew his bark ashore. He was, however, for- 
tunate enough to get the vessel oil, and having repaired her "went 
merrily away for Trist " with a full cargo of "Oyl." Sir Hans Sloaue, 
founder of the British Museum, who visited the Bahamas in 1687-'88, 
wrote that these "Islands are tilled with seals; sometimes fishers will 
catch one hundred in a night. They try. or melt Them, and bring off 
their oil for lamps to the islands."' By 1813 the seal seems to have

been pretty thoroughly exterminated and to have become mainly eon- 
lined to the Pedro Kays, some low rooky islets lying about CO miles 
south of Jamaica, and it was from this locality that, in the spring of 
1S4G, the specimen was secured which was presented by Gosse to the 
British Museum, and, as above stated, long remained unique. The 
West Indian seal has been reported from time to time as occurring at 
Suit Key Bank, in the Bahamas, on the coast of Yucatan, and two 
were even taken on the coast of Florida about 1875, hut not until 188.'? 
did a second specimen find its way into a museum. This, an immature 
female, was taken near Havana, and through the courtesy of Professor 
Poey secured for the U. S. National Museum, and after a lapse of three 
hundred and seventy yearsits positionamongsealsexactlydefined(Plate 
XOV). In 1886 Mr. Henry L.Ward visited theTriangles, three littleislets 
108 miles northwesterly from Yucatan, and there found, as he had 
hoped, a colony of seals, from which he secured some forty specimens 
before a rising norther forced the party to run back to Campeche. 
Just how plentiful the seals are now Mr. Ward does not tell us, but 
at some time they must have been abundant, since the writer's father, 
who was at the Triangles in 1850, found quantities of skeletons and 
spoiled hides, indicating the recent existence of a flourishing seal 
fishery. Whether the West Indian seal is doomed to destruction or not is 
a little uncertaiu, for so far as food, climate, and suitable breeding places 
are concerned, everything is favorable to its existence, and in time it 
may, like the southern right whale, to some extent fill up its now deci- 
mated ranks. On the other hand, when a species has been reduced be- 
lpwa certain point it seems, like a stone rolling down-hill, to pursue its 
downward course with continually accelerated speed until the bottom 
is reached and the species exists no more.

THE CALIFORNIA SEA-ELEPHANT. 
( Macrorhinus angttstirostris.) 

The California sea-elephant so nearly resembles that of the antarctic 
seas that one general description can easily serve for both. The sea- 
elephant is aptly so called, both on account of its size and because the 
male is furnished with a proboscis, which though short is suggestive of 
its namesake of the laud. It is the largest of the seals, greatly exceed- 
ing the walrus, for an old male sea-eleplmnt reaches a length of 15 to

ANIMALS RECENTLY EXTINCT. C17 

Hi feet, or counting from tip of proboscis to the end of the outstretched 
hind flippers, a length of 20 to 22 feet. When in good condition the an- 
imal is very fat, old males attaining a circumference of 15 to 18 feet, and 
one of the last- mentioned size has yielded as much as 210 gallons of oil. 
Che female sea-elephant is much smaller than the male, not exceed- 
ing 9 or 10 feet in length ; the female, moreover, is destitute of a probos- 
cis, as are also all young, this being the mark of a full grown male. The 
color is gray, with a blackish or olive cast, darkest on the back.* 

Considering the former abundance of these animals on the California 
coast, very little has been recorded of their habits or habitat, but the 
sea-elephant appears to have ranged along the coast of California and 
Lower California, from about latitude 25° to 35°, although in early 
days it may have considerably exceeded these limits. As just noted 
above, the other species of sea-elephant is a southern animal of wide 
distribution, and the nearest it approaches to the isolated northern 
species is on the western coast of South America. It may be that the 
gap now existing between these points was once tilled up, and that 
since the disappearance of the animals at intermediate localities the 
northern species has become differentiated from the southern. Or, 
again, the California species may have originated from a few stragglers 
who wandered north and being undisturbed increased and multiplied. 
Prior to 1852 sea-elephants were extremely abundant in the vicinity 
of Cerros Island, where the sealers erected rough stone huts in order 
to prosecute their labors to the best advantage. The animals were ac- 
customed to crawl out on certain favorite beaches, and in spite of their 
bulky forms and slow mode of progress ascended the ravines for a dis- 
tance of half a mile or so, congregating in herds of several hundred. 
In such situations they fell an easy prey to the hunters whose methods 
are well described by Captain Scammou : 

The sailors get between the herd and the water; then raising all possible noise 
by shouting and at the same time flourishing clubs, guns, and lances, the party 
advance slowly toward the rookery, when the animals will retreat, appearing in a 
slate of great alarm. Occasionally an overgrown male will give battle or attempt 
to escape, but a musket-ball through the brain dispatches it, or some one checks its 
progress by thrusting a lance into the roof of its mouth, which canses it to settle on 
its haunches, when two men with heavy oaken clubs give the creature repeated 
blows about the head until it is stunned or killed. After securing those that are dis- 
posed to show resistance, the party rush on the main body. The onslaught creates 
such a panic among these peculiar creatures that, losing all control of their actions, 
fchey climb, roll, and tumble over each other, when prevented from further retreat by 
the projecting cliffs. We recollect in one instance, where sixty-live were captured, 
that several were found showing no signs of having been either clubbed or lanced, 
hut were smothered by numbers of their kind heaped upon them. 



"It is a difficult matter to accurately describe the color of seals, as under varying 
conditions they appear quite differently. When alive the hair is close to the body 
and is either wet or greasy, appearing from this cause much darker than it really is. 
Mounted specimens are frequently stained by grease so that the pelage has a yel- 
lowish cast. For these reasons authors disagree considerably in their descriptions 
of tin- color of these animals. 



618 'REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889 

By 1860, sea-elephants bail become so scarce that their pursuit was no 
longer profitable, and from that time up to 1SS0 so few stragglers were 
seen about Guadaloupe and San Benita Islands that the animal was 
currently regarded as extinct. In 1880 the schooner iSan Diego killed 
thirty sea-elephants at the Elephant Beach, San Cristobal Bay, on the 
main laud of Lower California, 50 miles south of Cerros Island. In 
1882 forty were killed, and six young ones brought alive to San Fran- 
cisco, oue of which found its way to the National Museum by way of 
the Philadelphia Zoo. (Plate XC VI.) In 1883 one hundred and ten 
sea-elephants over a year old were taken, at least fourteen being bulls 
of large size. In 1884 ninety-three animals were taken by the sloop 
Liberty, a few females and young being left undisturbed, which were 
unfortunately all killed later in the season by the crew of the City of 
San Diego. In October of the same year Mr. Townsend, with the schooner 
Laura, visited the locality in the interests of the IT. S, National Museum; 
but although three young were seen they were spared in the hope that 
their presence might induce larger animals to haul out later on. Con- 
tinuing the search southward the Laura visited all localities in Lower 
California formerly iuhabited by the sea-elephant, and finding none, 
returned to San Cristobal in December and took fifteen whose skins 
and skeletous made their way to the National Museum at Washington. 
It is quite possible that this is the end of the California sea-elephant 
although a few may still exist to be slaughtered later on. It is greatly 
to be deplored that this animal should have beeu exterminated, when 
it could so easily have been preserved by each year sparing the young 
and a few adults/ But it is a curious fact that those most interested in 
the preservation of any animal are not only indifferent on that point, 
but are the most strenuous opponents of any measure to effect such a 
result, and even were it not too late to endeavor to protect the sea- 
elephants it is not to be supposed that they could be saved from ulti- 
mate destruction.

THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC WALRUSES. 

The walrus is too well known to require even a passing description, 
but it may be said that although very similar iu appearance the walrus 
of the Atlantic and that of the Pacific are distinct species, respectively 
known as Odobcenus rmmarus and Odohcenus obesus. The scarred and 
wrinkled appearance, so characteristic of these animals, is well exhib- 
ited bv the head of the Pacific walrus shown on Plate XCVII. Al-

though not as yet verging on extinction, the ranks of both species have 
been sadly decimated, and the animals have been completely extirpated 
in localities where they once abounded. In Europe the walrus has oc- 
casionally been met with on the coast of Scotland, and was formerly 
plentiful on many of the islands adjacent to the northern coast of the 
continent, and even along the continent itself, reaching eastward to the 
Lena River, iu Asia. In America the Atlantic wabus formerly ranged 
from Nova Scotia northward to about 80 degrees, being abundant in the 
Gulf of St Lawrence and occurring on Sable Island and the eastern coast 
of Newfoundland. The walrus was kuown in Europe as early as 870 to 
890, and appears to have been an object of the chase on the coast of 
Finmark in 080, while by 1000 it was the object of a regular fishery by 
the English and others. In the early part of 1600 Cherie, or Bear Island, 
lying about 280 miles to the northward of North Cape, Norway, was 
the scene of operation, and many a ship load — ships were small in those 
days it should be remembered — of oil and ivory was obtained at this 
locality. The walruses were accustomed to haul out on shore, and by 
getting between them and the water immense numbers were killed in 
a short time, the bodies of those first slain being used as a barrier to 
obstruct the retreat of the survivors. On one occasion six or seven hun- 
dred were killed in six hours, and on another nine hundred to a thousand 
in less than seven hours. Naturally this abundance did not long con- 
tinue, and in eight years the animals had become scarce and shy, while 
soon after they were completely extirpated iu this locality. Farther 
and farther to the north, to Spitsbergen and the shores of Greenland, 
the hunters pursued the rapidly-diminishing herds of walruses, until 
the pursuit in itself became no longer profitable, and, as at present, the 
walrus fishery was carried on merely as an adjunct to the whale fishery. 
So early as 1534 Oartier mentions meeting with walruses in the vicinity 
of the Magdalen Islands, and it probably was not long before a regular 
''fishery" for these animals was established on the Island of liamea, 
very probably one of the Magdalen group. In 1581 the French ship 
Bonaventure, at Pile Blance "slewe and killed to the number of fiiteene 
hundred Morses or Sea Oxen, accounting small and great," and in 1503 
the ship Marigold, in company with another vessel, sailed from Falmouth 
for the express purpose of hunting the walrus. The Marigol 77 seems to 
have been well equipped, foramong the crew of thirty were three coopers 
and two butchers, but owing to delay on the part of her consort the sea 
son was lost. An English company located on Sable Island, and at 
about the same time a French company was established at Miscou, Bay 
Chaleur. The English company soon came to grief, but its French rival 
did a flourishing business as long as the walruses lasted, killing so many 
that years alter the company ami its headquarters of New Kochelle 
had passed away, the bones of the slaughtered animals remained in 
such quantities as to form artificial beaches. In those days walrus 
ivory seems to have been in fashion, for a note in Ilakluyt tells us that 



620 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, lss-> 

"The teeth of the sayd fishes, whereof 1 have seen a dry fat fall at 
ouce, are a foote and sometimes more in length : and have been sold in 
England to the eombe and knife makers at 8 groats and 3 shillings the 
pound weight whereas the best Ivory is solde for halfe the money." 
Tiie Pacific walrus never had so extensive range as its relative of the 
Atlantic, reaching in scattered numbers to about 55 degrees north, on 
the American coast and (10 degrees on the Asiatic coast, and extend- 
ing thence northwards to the limit of ice. Point Barrow on the east 
and Cape Schelatskoi (157° 30' east longitude) on the west seem to be 
the natural boundaries of < he Pacific walrus, the species being unusually 
abundant at Bristol Bay, Alaska. The existence of the Pacific walrus 
was made known not far from 1640 or 1645, but it did not become a 
regular object of pursuit until about 1860, its immunity being due to 
the fact that whaling was far more profitable than the pursuit of the 
walrus. As the whale decreased in numbers the whalemen directed 
their attention more and more to the walruses, and between 1870 and 1880 
there was brought to market 1,996,000 gallons of oil and 398,868 pounds 
of walrus ivory, these amounts representing the destruction of not far 
from 100,000 animals. Although far inferior to elephant ivory the de- 
mand for walrus tusks is nevertheless great, and while the price per 
pound was, in 1879, but 40 or 45 cents, it was worth in 1880 $1 to $1.25 
per pound, and in 1883 $4 to $4.50. Being rather a stupid animal, and 
with due caution readily approached when on the ice, under favorable 
conditions the walrus is slaughtered iu much the same manner as the 
bison was killed by skin hunters. In making a shot, as it is technically 
termed, a man provided with one or two rifles and an abundance of am- 
munition approaches the herd from leeward, and picking off the more 
wakeful or more suspicious animals first, proceeds to kill the walruses 
until so many have been secured as can be handled or until the herd 
becomes alarmed and takes to the water. The Pacific walrus is in 
greater danger of extermination than its congener of the Atlantic, owing 
to the fact that the range of the species is restricted, while its haunts 
are regularly resorted to by the North Pacific whaling fleet, whose 
crews, as previously stated, devote considerable time to the chase of the 
walrus, and have reduced the numbers of this huge animal about one- 
half during the last ten years.

ANIMALS RECENTLY EXTINCT. <I'21 

THE EUROPEAN BISON. 
(Bison bonassus.) 

The European bison, or zubr* (Bison bonassus), bears a very close re- 
semblance to its American relative, but is a little taller, not so heavily 
built at the fore quarters, and lacks the shaggy hair about the head 
and neck that gives the American bison so tierce an appearance. Al- 
though never existing in such enormous numbers as the American bison, 
the zubr in early days seems to have very generally inhabited the for- 
ests of Central Europe. Osesar found the animal in Germany and Bel- 
gium, and some were brought to Rome, where they were slaughtered 
in gladiatorial exhibitions of the Coliseum. 

The American and European bison were quite different in their 
habits, although this was largely due to the physical characteristics of 
the regions respectively inhabited by the two species, the American 
species preferring the open plains, where it associated in immense herds, 
feeding upon grass, while the European species was a forest dweller, 
found in small bands and living very largely on the bark and twigs of 
young trees. The difference in habits between the two animals is 
well shown by the fact thai the European bison was not found on the 
steppes of southern Russia, although this region in many respects re- 
sembles the plains of the western and southwestern United States. 
At present the European bison is restricted to part of Lithuania and 
the more inaccessible portion of the Caucasus, this latter region being 
the ouly locality where the animal is found in a state of entire freedom. 
The Lithuanian herd, which has enjoyed imperial protection for many 
years, dwells in the Bjelowesche forest of the province of Grodno ; is 
watched over by a large number of keepers, and is fed during the winter, 
while in the Caucasus the zubr is protected by the rugged nature of 
the region it inhabits and also by an order of the Grand Duke Michael, 
issued in 1860, forbidding the slaughter of the animal. The specific 
identity of the Lithuanian and Caucasian bison is still in dispute, but 
that there is at least a subspecific distinction between them seems prob- 
able, from the fact that the Caucasian animal is less thickly haired 
than the Lithuanian, although living at a greater altitude and exposed 
to a greater degree of cold. 

Up to 1500 the European bison seems to have been common in Po- 
land, where it was looked upon as royal game, and hunted in right royal 
manner by the King and nobility, as many as two thousand or three 
thousand beaters being employed to drive the game. In 1534 the ani- 
mal was still so numerous in the vicinity of Girgau, Transylvania, that 



"This species is coniinonly but improperly called tin* aurochs, but, as Professor 
Alfred NewtOD says, "the aurochs (= ox of yore), Latinized by Ctesar in the form of 
urus, is, or was, the Bon primigeniw, <>r Bos urus, of scientific nomenclature.

peasants passing through the woods were occasionally trampled to 
death by startled bison, and hunts were undertaken by the nobles in 
order to reduce the uumbers of the animals. In spite of this local 
abundance, it is probable that about this time the bison was in a great 
measure restricted to Lithuania, aud although so late as 1555 one was 
killed in Prussia, it is almost certain that this was merely a straggler 
from the main herd. In 1752 a grand hunt was organized by the Po- 
lish King Augustus III, and in one day sixty bison were killed, besides 
a considerable quantity of other large game, the Queen, who partici- 
pated, killing twenty bison, and finding time in the intervals of sport 
to do some light reading. This achievement was deemed worthy of 
commemoration by a monument, although the manner iu which the 
battue was conducted renders the performance less remarkable than 
might appear at first sight. Two huge, strongly built, converging 
fences were erected, and just by the exit, at the apex of the gigantic V 
thus formed, was a platform on which the royal party sat at ease and 
shot the game as it emerged from the trap into which it had been 
driven by a small army of beaters. For some time after the above 
event little seems to have been recorded concerning the zubr, so that 
Desmarest, writing in 1822, says that if any remain in Lithuania they 
must be very few in number.* There were, however, over five hundred 
bison in Lithuania at that time, for in 1820 there was that number, this 
being a considerable increase since 1815, when there was estimated to 
be only three hundred. About this time active measures must have 
been taken for the protection of the Lithuanian herds, for in 1830 
"owing to the better enforcement of the laws" it comprised seven hun- 
dred individuals. In 1831 a local revolt occurred, the game laws were 
set at naught, and the number of bisou reduced to six hundred and 
thirty-seven. Order having been restored the bison began to recuper- 
ate, and according to the official enumeration at the end of each dec- 
ade, there were iu 1840, seven hundred and eighty, in 1850, one thou- 
sand three hundred and ninety, and in 1860, seventeen hundred. 
Political troubles, however, were the bane of the bison, and just as 
the prosperity of the Lithuanian herd seemed assured, the Polish upris- 
ing of 1803 took place; many bands of insurgents sought refuge in the 
forests; the bison were left to take care of themselves; and were so' rap- 
idly killed off, that the next official count showed only eight hundred 
and forty-seven. For a short time after peace was restored, the herd 
increased to a slight extent, but later on it began to decrease, the enu- 
meration of 1880 showing but six hundred, a. number that has since 
been lessened, the herd being still upon the wane. The cause of this 
decrease is not quite apparent, and although it has been ascribed to in- 
breeding, it would seem as if some other reason, must besought for, 
since the wild cattle at Chillingham, England, are still extant, although

from the smallness of the herd they have of necessity been very largely 
inbred.* That inbreediug has something to do with the decrease of 
the bison is indicated by the observed fact that many of the females 
bring forth calves after having been infertile for several successive 
years, but although it has been suggested that this might be helped 
by the introduction of animals from the Caucasus, the remedy would 
be difficult of application as well as expensive. As the herd is, or at 
least was, divided into ten or twelve bands, each confined to a dif- 
ferent part of the forest, perhaps some improvement might be effected 
by judiciously crossing the members of these various groups. The 
present rate of decrease is slow, and the Lithuanian herd will exist 
for many years, even if the loss is not prevented. As for the Cau- 
casian bison, protected as it is by nature as well as by man, it may 
endure for centuries to come, and improbable as it once may have 
seemed, be in existence long years after the American bison has ceased 
to live even in tradition. 

THE RYTINA OR ARCTIC SEA-COW. 

(Rytina gigas.) 

The extinct Arctic sea-cow or rytina, an animal nearly related to the 
existing Manatee and Dugong, played somewhat the same part iu the 
exploration of the northwest coast of America that the buffalo did in 
the settlement of the western plains. In the autumn of 1741 Bering, 
returning from a voyage of discovery to the coast of Alaska, was ship- 
wrecked on the island now bearing his name, this being the larger of 
two islands lying about 100 miles from the coast of Kamchatka, and 
known as the Commander Islands. The survivors of the expedition, 
who were forced to remain on Bering Island for the ensuing ten 
months, are frequently, though erroneously, said to have subsisted to 
a great extent on the flesh of the huge sirenian discovered by them, 
and described subsequently under the name of Manatus gigas. As a 
matter of fact, the first rytina taken by Bering's party was not killed 
until the 12th of July following the wreck, seal, otters, and later on, 
far seals, furnishing a supply of meat. 

For our knowledge of the external appearance of the rytina, its 
habits, and the localities it was wont to frequent, we are indebted to G. 
W. Steller, the surgeon of Bering's command, and an enthusiastic 
naturalist, who carried on his researches in spite of the privations attend- 
ing a wreck, the inclemency of the weather, and the ravages of disease.

tiua offers, or rather offered, the spectacle of a creature whose rela- 
tions are confined to the tropics residing in a subarctic region. In 
point of size the rytina far exceeded its relatives, attaining a length 
of from 24 to 30 feet and an aldermanic circumference of 19 or 20, 
weighing according to Steller's estimates 8,000 pounds. The head 
was very small in proportion to the body, the jaws toothless, being 
provided in lieu of teeth with a thick, horny pad, very similar to 
that covering the anterior portion of the lower jaw of the dugong. 
Owing to the peculiar structure of the epidermis, an exaggeration of 
the condition found in the manatee and elephant, the skin was so thick, 
rough, and wrinkled that, being dark colored, its appearance was com- 
pared by Steller to the bark of a tree. Although in places the epidermis 
was an inch in thickness, and so extremely hard as to necessitate the 
use of an axe in order to cut it, the dermis was only one-sixth of an inch 
thick. The rytina was gregarious, and found in herds about the 
mouths of streams, where it lived on seaweeds, especially on the large 
abundant laminarias. It was stupid, sluggish and comparatively heip-

less, being unable to protect itself by diving, and occasionally washed 
ashore by the breakers. Inability to dive forced the rytina to seek its 
food in shallow water, and since the storms and ice of winter often 
rendered it a difficult matter to approach the shore at that season, 
spring usually found the animal much reduced in flesh.

Soon after the return of the survivors of Bering's party to Kamchatka, 
expeditions were fitted out for the purpose of wintering - on the Comman- 
der Islands and hunting fur-bearing animals, the great northern sea cow 
offering an abundant supply of fresh meat, a great desideratum in those 
days, when scurvy was one of the greatest and most common dangers en- 
countered by navigators. The first expeditions were followed by others, 
the rytina being relied upon to furnish the bulk of the provisions, and 
vessels sailing for the northwest coast of America were also accustomed 
to stop at Bering Island for the purpose of laying in a supply of salted 
sea-cow. At that date there were no cattle in Kamchatka to furnish 
either fresh or salted provisions, so that the rytina was a veritable god- 
send to the fur-hunters who improved their opportunities to the utmost. 
As Dr. Stejueger has shown, it is a matter of record that between 
1743 and 1763 nineteen parties of from thirty to fifty each wintered 
on Bering Island, while others are known to have wintered on 
Copper Island, and still others simply touched there for supplies. 
During their stay these parties lived on fresh rytina, while a large 
part of their occupation consisted in killing and salting down the ani- 
mal for future use. Small wonder is it that a helpless creature of re- 
stricted range and slow reproduction should have succumbed rapidly 
to the systematic attacks of man. This slaughter of the sea-cows must 
have resulted in their extermination, even had it been carried on with 
the utmost care, but the end was hastened by the method of capture 
employed by the small parties of hunters who were scattered along the 
northern and eastern shores, and were compelled to attack and kill the 
huge beast single-handed. Ordinarily the rytina was taken by the 
harpoon from an eight-oared boat, the animal after a short struggle 
being towed ashore and dispatched, but the fox hunters used to cau- 
tiously approach the creature while lying in shallow water and endeavor 
to mortally wound it with a lance thrust. It naturally happened that 
comparatively few would be killed outright, the majority escaping to 
deep water, there to die of their wounds, and later on to drift ashore, 
where the body would be found by the hunters. Some, of course, 
would never reach the shore, while others would be recovered after 
such a lapse of time as to be unfit for food, the more that the rytina 
spoiled so rapidly that if not properly cared for within twenty-four hours 
after death the flesh was worthless. By 1754, only nine .years after the 
discovery of the island, the sea-cow had become extirpated on Copper 
Island, and by 1763 was probably nearly exterminated on Bering 
Island, as from that time on records of visits to the place are rare. 
According to the careful estimates of Dr. Stejueger there were not 
more than fifteen hundred to two thousand rvtiiias about the island at 
the time of its discovery, there being hardly more than fifteen suitable 
feeding places, so that the work of extermination was not difficult. 
The last individual of the race was killed in 1707 or 1768, and although 
Professor Nordenskjold imagined he had discovered evidence that a

specimen had been seen so late as 1854, the animal at that time seen 
by the natives appears in the light of all testimony on the subject, to 
have been a narwhal. Up to 1883 two skeletons, one in the Imperial 
Museum of St. Petersburg, and one in the collection of the Imperial 
Academy of Helsingfors, and two ribs in the British Museum, were all 
the remains of the rytina preserved in scientific institutions. At that 
date Dr. Stejneger visited Bering Island, 'influenced largely by the 
hope of securing specimens of this extinct sea-cow for the U. S. National 
Museum. This hope was fully realized, for in the course of a stay of 
two years, a considerable series of more or less complete skulls was ob- 
tained, besides many vertebrae, ribs, and other bones. These were 
buried at various depths in the sand, and were discovered by probing 
with an iron rod, rytina bones being readily distinguished by their 
greater density from those of cetaceans, that are found in the same 
locality. 

Many bones were found at so considerable a distance from the water's 
edge as to suggest that the land had risen since the extinction of the 
rytina, a probability that was changed to a certainty by the discovery 
of a nearly complete skeleton far inland. 

This interesting find is thus recorded by Dr. Stejneger in the Proceed- 
ings of the Geographical Society of Bremen : 

Toward noon it was reported to me that the skeleton of a Bea-cow had been found. 
Conceive my agitation, and the haste with which the spades were seized. We had to 
walk some distance, and when I reached the spot, I found the report confirmed. 
From the bank of the brook which ran from the south several ribs protruded. The 
brook had slowly eaten its way into the hillock of sand, and thus by degrees exposed 
and washed away the bones. When we began to dig, we saw at once that it was the 
tail end which was missing. The distance from the sea was about 500 feet, and the 
skeleton lay about 10 to 12 feet above high-water mark. It was imbedded in a hil- 
lock of sand, which belonged to one of the inner rows of dunes. The hillock was 
about 12 feet high, and the skeleton, which was lying upon its back with the head 
toward the west, was situated at about an equal distance from the base and the grass 
covered upper surface of the hill. The sand was wet and fine, of the same kind which 
is still thrown up daily by the sea at the not far distant beach and showed alternat- 
ing brown and blue layers. Near the bones the sand sometimes was blackish, iridescent, 
which was due to the fact that the bones were in a very advanced state of decompo- 
sition. This became evident to me after the first few strokes of the spade. Indeed, 
the skeleton as such was worthless. The separate bones had not cohesion enough to 
allow of their being lifted without injury, their own weight being too heavy. Even 
the ribs, which otherwise are of ivory-like consistency and density, had rotted 
throughout, and some of the bones were so soft that they felt like "green butter 
soap " to the touch. In order, however, to ascertain all the circumstances precisely, 
I continued the excavation until all the fragments had been brought to light. Alto- 
gether there were found fourteen dorsal vertebrae with the ribs belonging to them, 
the cervical vertebra, the skull, the breast bone, two shoulder bones, two upper arm 
bones, but only one forearm. All the bones were in their natural position, with the 
exception of the breastbone, which lay outside of the skeleton, near the right fore- 
limb, while the left fore-limb, consisting only of shoulder blade and humerus, lay 
inside the thorax. Although none of the bones were of any use to us, nevertheless I 
did not look upon our labor as lost, since they enabled me to determine, in the first 
place, the conditions under which many of these skeletons had been destroyed, and 
secondly that the island had risen, since these remnants had been buried under the 
sand of the former shore.

627 



Although the skeleton just referred to was unfortunately of no use as 
a specimen, sufficient bones were obtained to render possible the " ma- 
king up " of a fairly complete skeleton. (Plate XCIX.) Unfortunately 
there is one point which even the extensive series of bones collected 
by Dr. Stejneger fails to determine, and that is the question as to 
whether or not the rytiua had any bones in the hand. Steller, who 
was an exceedingly paius-taking and accurate observer, expressly 
states that there were none, and none have as yet been found ; while, 
ou the other hand, the bones of the fore-arm possess well defined articu- 
lar surfaces showing that bones were at least present in the wrist. 

With the exception of a rib from Attu no remains of rytina have 
as yet been found at any localities save Bering and Copper Islands, 
but it is probable that these were the last retreat of the survivors of a 
once numerous race, and that they were discovered in time for man to 
complete the extermination of a species that, from unkuown causes, 
had long been on the wane.

THE MAMO. 

(l)rcpanis pacifica Gmel.) 

If has long been expected that Drepanis pacifica, one of the most 
beautiful and peculiar birds restricted in its range to the Sandwich 
Islands, will have to be counted among the species which have become 
extinct in recent times. And now that Mr. Scott Wilson has returned 
from a thorough ornithological survey of the archipelago without hav-

ing obtained anything but a stuffed specimen from a local collection 
formed many years ago, it is almost certaiu that the " Pacific Sickle- 
bill" has disappeared from among the living, and that the few speci- 
mens in the museums, perhaps less than half a dozen, are all that is 
left of a species that ouce was common in the " Eden of the Pacific." 
Mr. Scott Wilson is also the first one to suggest the probable cause of 
its extinction, for he saw some of the celebrated feather wreaths, or 
" leis," of the natives composed of yellow feathers taken from this bird, 
and from the fact that the Hawaiian name of the bird, " Mamo" is the 
same as that of the costly war- cloaks, he concludes that the robes in 
olden times were chiefly wrought of the beautiful golden-yellow feath- 
ers from its back, which are much deeper in color, as they are larger 
and longer, than the axillary tufts of the O-o. In order to understand 
how probable this explanation of the final extermination of the bird is, 
we shall have to briefly describe these ornamental capes and cloaks. 
In former times the kings, chiefs, and noble Hawaiians, whenever they 
appeared in public on special occasions, in peace or war, donned the 
royal flowing capes or cloaks made of gay birds' feathers fastened to 
a groundwork of coarse netting, which seem to have had the same sig- 
nificance and to have been as eagerly coveted and highly revered as the 
ermine and purple in feudal Europe. Smaller ornaments, " leis," or 
feather- wreaths were used as neck-laces by the ladies. Perhaps the 
most magnificent of these robes was that of Kamehameha I, the great 
conqueror who united all the islands under his scepter. Mr. Scott 
Wilson gives the following description of it: 

The fabrication of the great yellow war-cloak of Kamehameha I had been going on 
through the reign of eight preceding monarchs. The groundwork is of coarse net- 
ting, to which are attached, with skill now impossible to be applied, the delicate 
feathers, those ou the border being reverted. Its length is 4 feet, aud it has a spread 
of 11£ feet at the bottom, the whole having the appearance of a mantle of gold.* 

As only a few feathers on each bird were used, it may be imagined 
how many thousand birds it required to furnish the feathers of a single 
robe, and it is a greater wonder that there were enough birds than 
that the species of the brighter color became extinct. Small bunches 
of these feathers were received by the kings as a poll-tax from the lower 
classes of tbe people, but these were not enough, so the chiefs used 
to have " a regular staff of bird-catchers who were expert in this voca- 
tion. They made use of the sticky jnice of the bread-fruit, called in 
Hawaiian 'pihah,' aud the tenacious gum of the fragrant 'olapa,' a com- 
mon tree in some parts of the forests, smearing the stuff about the 
branches of a flower covered 'ohai.'" It is asserted that the O-o (Moho 

* The cloak deposited in the U. S. National Museum by Mr. R. O. Aulick is of pre- 
cisely the same size as this, but is a trifle over one-half composed of red feathers. It 
was formerly the property of the powerful chief Kekuaskalami, who, on the abolition 
of idolatry in 1819, rebelled, with the intention of restoring the ancient religion. 
The rebellion was unsuccessful and Kekuaskalami killed. The cloak was presented 
to Commodore J. H. Aulick by King Kamehameha in in 1841.

nobilis), a black honeysuoker, with a tuft of elongated yellow feathers 
uuder the wing, was caught alive, the feathers pulled out, and the bird 
then let loose, but as the body feathers of the Mamo {Drepanis pacified) 
were the only ones to be used it had probably to be killed, and this u\&y 
be the very reason why the former is still a comparatively common bird 
on the island, while the latter has become extinct. The Mamo was a 
honeysucker remarkable for its long and curved bill, which earned for 
it the name " Sickle-bill," Drepanis. As already mentioned, it is very 
rare in museums — we can at present only recall four specimens — and a 
good description is yet a desideratum. In default of a better we re- 
produce the original, which was made by Latham a little over a hundred 
years ago from specimens brought home by Captain Cook's expedition, 
during which the Hawaiian Islands were discovered. 

Length, 8 inches; bill, If iuches, stout at the base, and very much hooked; color 
of it brown, with a pale base; the upper parts of the body are black, except the 
lower part of the back, the rump, and upper tail coverts, which are of a fine deep 
yellow, the under parts of the body dusky ; the shoulders, inner ridge of the wing, 
and part of the inner wing coverts are of the same yellow ; the bastard wing yellow- 
ish-white at the end ; the under wing coverts snow white ; the sides of the vent, the 
vent itself, and the thighs are yellow; the tail and quills black; the legs black- 
brown. 

This is not the only Hawaiian bird which has become extinct within 
historical times. A similar fate has probably also befallen Chcetoptila 
angustipluma (Peale), of which probably not more than one specimen 
exists besides the type which is in the U. S. National Museum, and the 
small tailless Rail (Pennula ecaudata) which is nearly as rare. But still 
worse, many more of the feathered tribes found only in those wonder- 
fid islands seem to be near extinction, partly because of the destruc- 
tion of the forest, partly on account of the introduction of hardier and 
more aggressive species, such as the detested English sparrow. So 
gloomy is the prospect that Mr. Scott Wilson exclaims: " It would not 
be rash to say that ere another century has elapsed but few native 
species will remain." 

THE CALIFORNIA VULTURE. 
( P8eudogryph its californ ianus.) 

The California Vulture disputes with the Condor the claim of being 
the largest of the New World vultures, for, while the Condor is a little 
the more strongly built the California Vulture has a little the greatest 
spread of wing, large specimens having an alar extent of a little more 
than 10 feet. It is more plainly clad than the Condor, the general 
color being brownish-black, slightly glossy above, while the conspicu- 
ous ruff of soft white feathers that encircles the neck of the great Vul- 
ture of the Andes is lacking in its northern relative. The tips of the 
greater wing coverts are whitish, forming a line across the closed wing, 
and a broad band of white extends along the uuder side of the wing, 



630 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

forming a conspicuous mark when the bird sails overhead. Plate C. 
This vulture formerly ranged from the Colorado to the Columbia Rivers, 
between the Sierra Nevadas and the sea, and is said to have been in 
the habit of ascending the Columbia for a distance of 500 miles in 
order to feast upon the abundant dead salmon cast up on the banks. 
While this section of country is the regular habitat of the California 
Vulture, individuals have been reported from Arizona, or even so far 
outside these limits as southwestern Utah, though these last may be 
regarded as stragglers. A few hundred miles more or less would, of 
course, be nothing to a bird of such powers of flight that it seems to 
float in the air with as much ease as a fish floats in water, for it would 
seem as if nature having assigned the vultures to do scavenger's duty 
had made some amends by giving them a strong and graceful flight. 
Like the other members of the family, the California Vulture feeds 
chiefly on carrion ; in spite of its size and strength rarely attacking liv- 
ng animals, unless they have been so severely wounded as to be unable 
to walk, and while several have been known to combine forces and at- 
tack and kill young calves, this is very exceptional. 

The strength of these birds is shown by the fact that four of them 
were able to drag the carcass of a young bear, weighing 100 pounds, for 
a distance of 200 yards, but owing to the structure of their feet and 
the weakness of the beak and claws their powers of offence are by no 
means commensurate with their size. The bird seems never to have 
been very abundant, and although Dr. Newbury speaks of it as com- 
mon in the Sacramento Valley in 1850, he does not mention it as occur- 
ring in flocks. On the Columbia not more than two or three would be 
seen at a time, and although Dr. Canfield has seen as many as a hundred 
and fifty gathered around a dead antelope, it is probable that in this 
case they had assembled from over a great area — brought together by 
the actions of the bird who first discovered the dead animal. Soaring 
as they do at great heights these birds command a view over a territory 
many miles in extent, their keen eyes not only searching the ground 
below, but keeping a sharp lookout on the behavior of any of their fel- 
lows that chance to be within sight. No sooner does one bird spy a 
prospective dinner than another, still farther away, is apprised of the 
fact by his actions, and in a like manner, number two informs a third, 
so that the good news is rapidly spread, and throughout a vast area 
the vultures come hurrying to one point. It is thus that Canou Tris- 
tram accounts for the vast congregation of vultures at Sevastopol dur- 
ing the Crimean war, supposing that in this manner "may have col- 
lected the whole race from the Caucasus and Asia Minor." 

The threatened extermination of the California Vulture is indirectly, 
rather than directly, due to the agency of man, for its suspicious nature 
has ever rendered this bird difficult to capture, while the breeding 
places are in out of the way and often inaccessible localities, and al- 
though the Mexican miners of Lower California are said to kill the bird

on every possible opportunity in order that they may use the quills as 
receptacles for gold dust, the destruction thus caused would naturally 
be but small. The free use of strychnine in ridding' the cattle ranches 
of wolves and coyotes has caused the disappearance of this bird, which 
has been poisoned by feeding on the carcasses prepared for the four- 
footed scavengers. The California Vulture is now extremely rare, and 
in spite of many efforts to obtain specimens of this interesting bird few 
have been taken of late years, those few coming from southern Cali- 
fornia, which now seems to be the chief habitat of this Vulture. 

THE DODO AND THE SOLITAIRE. 
(Didus inepUis and Pezophaps solitaria.) 

What the brahma is among domestic fowls the dodo was to a far 
greater extent among the order of pigeons, a grotesque, aberrant, and 
gigantic member of the group. The first mention of the dodo* is in an 
account of the voyage of the Dutch Admiral Jacob Cornelius Van Neck 
to Mauritius in 1598. The dodo is there called Walckvogel, or dis- 
gusting fowl, partly on account of the toughness of portions of its flesh 
and partly because even the best portions of the dodo were poor in 
comparison with the tender meat of the abundant doves. This curious 
bird was found only in Mauritius. Another closely related species, the

probably a third member of the family at Bourbon, this last species 
being known only from the description of travelers, for not even a bone 
of it has ever come under the ken of naturalists. This peculiar distri- 
bution of didine birds is analagons to that of the Galapagos tortoises, 
although not quite so extraordinary, since the islands of Mauritius, 
Reunion, and Rodriguez are much farther apart than are those of the 
Galapagos Archipelago, and the chance of animals being accident- 
ally transported from one to another consequently much less. Mauri-

this, Rodriguez, and Reunion had also their respective species of large 
tortoises, but these too went the way of the dodo and its kindred, and 
only bones remain to tell the story of their former abundance. De Bry, 
the chronicler of Van Neck's voyage, says the Walckvogel were " big- 
ger than our swans, with large heads, half of which is covered with 
skin like a hood. These birds want wings, in place of which are three 
or four blackish feathers. The tail consists of a few slender curved 
feathers of a gray color."

ANIMALS RECENTLY EXTINCT. 033 

For a better idea of the appearance of the dodo we are indebted to 
the pictures of Koelandt Savary and his nephew John, Dutch artists 
of the iirst half of the 17th century, from whose paintings* we gather 
that the dodo was a heavy-bodied, short legged bird, with a dispropor- 
tionately large head, and huge, formidable-looking hooked bill. The 
body was sparingly clad in loose feathers, the wing feathers alone being 
still", the tail resembling a small feather duster. The general color, as 
noted by De Bry, was gray, or blackish, but the breast seems to have 
been brown, and the wings and tail yellowish, or dirty white. The 
bird, so Cause tells us, laid a single egg " the size of a half-penny roll, in 
a nest made of herbs heaped together," the somewhat indefinite size 
ascribed to the egg being qualified later on by comparison with that 
of the great white pelican {Pelecanus onocrotahts), which it was said to 
resemble in size. Not being acquainted with mankind the birds of 
Mauritius, like those of other uninhabited islands, were at first ex- 
tremely tame, but the dodo seems to have been not only unsuspicious 
but stupid into the bargain, a fact that rendered its extermination all 
the easier. It appears to have been customary upon the discovery of 
any new and edible animal, to give thanks to Providence and straight- 
way proceed to slaughter the creature, but in the case of the dodo the 
thanks were omitted, although the exterminating process was at once 
begun. 

Although the discoverers of the bird seem to have thought poorly of 
its gastronomic qualities, and indeed it would hardly compare favor- 
ably with doves, tortoises, turtles, and the abundant fishes of Mauri- 
tius, the next vessel to reach this isle of plenty made sad havoc with 
the unfortunate dodos. This was the ship of one William Van West 
Zannen, who stopped there in 1601, and seems to have made things 
very lively for all living creatures. He writes that " The dodos, with 
their round sterns (for they were well fattened), were also obliged to turn 
tail ; everything that could move was in a bustle; the fish which had 
lived in peace for many a year were pursued into the deepest water 
pool." One day Zaunen's crew took twenty-four dodos, on another 
twenty, " so large and heavy that they could not eat any two of them 
for dinner." The abundance of game is shown by the fact that five men 
not only captured twenty dodos in a day, but also some thirty other 
birds,t and with a good supply salted down, Van Zannen sailed away. 
Other Dutch ships followed in Van Zaunen's wake, feasted on tortoise 
and dodo, and, salting down a store, departed, leaving the ranks of the 
dodos sadly depleted. The last notice of the living Dodo occurs in a

t This day's work seems to have inspired the chronicler's muse, for lie records it in 
a four- line poem, translated by Dr. Strickland: 

"For food the seamen hunt the nosh of feathered fowl. 

They tap the palms, the round-sterned dodos they destroy: 

The parrot's life they spare, that he may scream and howl, 

And thus his fellows to imprisonment decoy." 



634 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

"A coppey of Mr. Benj. Harry's Journall when he was chief mate of 
the Shippe Berkley Castle," which shows that he was in Mauritius in 
1681 and saw "dodos, whose flesh is very hard." In 1693, a little less 
than a century after its discovery, the bird seems to have become extinct, 
for Leguat, the careful describer of the solitaire, makes no mention of 
the dodo, and moreover remarks that ducks, coots, and turtles of all 
kinds were then become rare. While man began the work of extirpation 
it is quite likely that his allies, cats, dogs, and pigs, completed the 
task, for wherever these animals have been introduced and run wild 
they have wrought sad havoc among the feathered race by destroying 
their eggs and young.* The cat and dog are said to be largely respon- 
sible for the rapid decrease of the New Zealand kiwi, and when this 
curious nocturnal bird passes out of existence it will, in great part, be 
due to the attacks of those two animals. Shortly after the dodo became 
extinct the Dutch, who had so far been the occupants of Mauritius, 
left the island and in 1715 the French took possession, only to give place 
to the English in 1810, one result of these various changes being that 
all knowledge of the quaint and curious bird was so utterly lost as not 
even to live in tradition, while the few specimens preserved in museums 
were so little known that some naturalists became skeptical as to the 
previous existence of such a bird as the dodo. 

The publications of Duncan, Broderip, and Strickland, however, speed- 
ily dissipated the slight haze of doubt, and in 1866 Mr. George Clark, 
of Mauritius, succeeded in obtaining a considerable series of bones, a 
portion of which served Mr. Owen for his memoir on the osteology of 
the dodo. These bones were procured from the mud at the bottom of 
a small marsh, known as the Mare aux Songes,t lying about a quarter 
of a mile from the sea. (Piute 01.) At the beginning of the present 
century this marsh, as well as the land immediately about it, was still 
covered with large trees whose fruits had doubtless formerly served 
the Dodo for food, and in this spot the bird seems to have lived and 
died in peace, for none of the bones are cut or gnawed, and here it left 
its remains for the benefit of future naturalists. Curiously enough this 
is the only place in Mauritius where bones of the Dodo have been brought 
to light, although various other localities have been tried in the hope of 
coming upon relies of this interesting bird. 

The Solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria), while presenting a general likeness 
to the Dodo, was somewhat more lightly built, and had decidedly longer 
legs and neck and a smaller beak. For a knowledge of the external 
appearance and habits of the Solitaire we are entirely dependent on 
the account of Francois Leguat, who in 1691 founded a colony at Rodri- 
guez, which endured only for the brief space of two years, owing to the

fact that Leguat seems to have not thought of providing wives for his 
colonists. While Leguat's description has been quoted and requoted, 
there is no other source from which information may be drawn, and it 
must once more be used.

Hind- part covered with Feathers is roundish, like the Crupper of a Horse ; they are 
taller than turkeys. Their neck is straight and a little longer in proportion than 
a Turkey's when it lifts up his Head. Its Eye is black and lively, and its Head 
without comb or cop. They never fly, their Wings are too little to support the 
weight of their Bodies ; they serve only to beat themselves, and flutter when they 
call one another. 

They will whirl about for twenty or thirty times together on the same side, during 
the space of four or five minutes. The motion of their Wings makes then a noise 
very like that of a Rattle; and one may hear it two hundred paces off. The 
Bone of their Wing grows greater toward the Extremity, and forms a little round 
mass under the Feathers, as big as a Musket Ball. That and its beak are the chief 
Defense of this Bird. 'Tis very hard to catch it in the Woods, but easy in open 
Places, because we run faster than they, and sometimes we approach them without 
much Trouble. From March to September they are extremely fat, and taste admirably 
well, especially while they are young. Some of the Males weigh forty-five Pounds. 

'Though these Birds will sometimes very familiarly come up near enough to one, 
when we do not run after them, yet they will never grow Tame. As soon as they 
are caught they shed Tears without Crying and refuse all manner of Sustenance till 
they die. 

When these Birds build their Nests, they choose a clean Place, gather together 
some Palm-Leaves for that purpose and heap them up a foot and a half high from the 
Ground, on which they sit. They never lay but one Egg, which is much bigger than 
that of a Goose. The Male and Female both cover it iu their turus, and the young 
which is not able to provide for itself in several Months, is not hatch'd till at seven 
Weeks' end. All the while they are sitting upon it they will uot suffer any other 
Bird of their Species to come within two hundred Yards round of the Place ; But 
what is very singular, is, the Males will never drive away the Females, only when he 
perceives one he makes a noise with his Wings to call the Female, and she drives the 
unwelcome Stranger away, not leaving it till 'tis without her Bounds. The Female 
does the same as to the Males, and he drives them away. We have observ'd this 
several Times, and I affirm it to be true. 

The Combats between them on this occasion last sometimes pretty long, because 
the Stranger only turus about, and do's not fly directly from the Nest. However the 
other do not forsake it till they have quite driven it out of their Limits. After these 
Birds have raised their young One, and left it to itself, they are always together, 
which the other Birds are not, and tho' they happen to mingle with other Birds of the 
same Species, these two Companions never disunite. We have often remarked that 
some Days after the young one leaves the Nest, a Company of thirty or forty brings 
another young one to it, and the new tiedg'd Bird, with its Father and Mother 
joyniugwith the Band, march to some bye Place We frequently followed them, aud 
found that afterwards the old ones went each their way alone, or in Couples, and 
left the two young ones together, which we call'd a Marriage. 

This Particularity has something in it which looks a little Fabulous, nevertheless, 
what I say is sincere Truth, and what I have more than once observ'd with care 
and Pleasure. 



636 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Through the efforts of Professor Alfred Newton and his brother Ed- 
ward a large collection of bones of the Solitaire was obtained frouii 
Rodriguez in 1866, these remains forming the basis for a very complete 
account of the osteology of the bird. These bones were procured from 
caves, but owing to the impossibility of securing intelligent supervis- 
ion, little can be said concerning their probable age, except that all 
seem to long antedate the settlement of the island. It is interesting to 
note that the wing bones corroborate Leguat's description of the Soli- 
taire, for they show the presence of a rounded callosity at the angle 
of the wing, just about the size of an old fashioned musket ball.

THE LABRADOR DUCK. 

( Camptolaimu8 labradorius.) 

The Labrador Duck was one of the many sea ducks which, during 
their southern migration, furnished considerable sport to gunners along 
the coast. In size and appearance it was not unlike the familiar Old 
Wife, or Quaudy (Hardda glacialis), to which, indeed, it is nearly re- 
lated. The body and primaries of the male are black, the rest of the 
wing, head and neck white, with a black collar and longitudinal stripe 
on the crown. (Plate CII.) The female is plumbeous gray, slightly 
darker on the under side. This duck ranged southward in winter to the 
coast of New Jersey and Chesapeake Bay, its summer habitat and breed-i 
ing ground being, according to Audubon, southern Labrador. It is by 
no meaus impossible, however, that the empty nests ascribed to the Lab- 
rador Duck may have been those of the Eider (Somateria Dresseri), as 
they were found on the breeding grounds of that species, and are said tc 
have resembled them in shape and size. While the Labrador Duck 
seems to never have been very common, it was not sufficiently rare tc 
attract the notice of collectors, and hence a very small number of speci 
mens, about thirty-six, are in existence. Considerable interest is at-i 
tached to two of these specimens in the U. S. National Museum, as they 
were collected by no less a person than Daniel Webster, and figured by 
Audubon. Webster was an enthusiastic sportsmau, and his home at 
Marshfield, close by Brant Rock, was one of the best localities for sea 
shooting on the coast of Massachusetts. The ducks in question, how 
ever, came from Vineyard Island. The bird, so Audubon tells us, wan 
frequently for sale in the markets of New York and Baltimore, and. 
according to the same authority, a "bird stuffer" of Camden, New

Jersey, used to take them like fishes on a long line baited with mus- 
sels. When interest in ornithology became more general, and collectors 
ami collections multiplied, it soon became evident that the Labrador 
Duck was extremely rare, and it is now believed to have become en- 
tirely extinct, no example having been taken since December, 1S78. It 
is a little difficult to understand why the Labrador Duck should have 
disappeared, for the bird was possessed of good powers of flight, bred 
in comparatively unfrequented localities at the north, and, as just 
stated, was not especially sought after. Some epidemic may have swept 
oft* the greater part of the race, but this is purely supposititious, as 
nothing of the kind is known to have occurred. That epidemics do 
(occur among birds is shown by Dr. Stejueger's account of the Pelagic 
ICormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) of the Commander Islands, thous- 
ands upon thousands of which died during the winter of 1876-'77, so 
that masses of dead birds covered the beach all around the islands. As 
this bird formed an important article of food during the time of year 
when the fur seal is not slain, fears were entertained by the residents 
iof the island that the bird might become extinct, like Pallas Cormorant. 
| But although the birds were scarce during the summer of 1877, their 
numbers have since increased, although they have never attained their 
former abundance. A possible cause for the original depletion may 
have been the taking of eggs by the Indians, for the Eider, which breeds 
alohg the southern coast of Labrador, suffers severely from their dep- 
redations. A small dog is trained to hunt through the bushes near 
the water's edge, the favorite nesting place of the Eider, while his 
master silently paddles along close to the shore to note just where a bird 
is driven from the nest, and in this manner many eggs are taken. Now 
if the Labrador Ducks bred over a comparatively small extentof country, 
near the summer camp of a baud of Indians, their original decrease 
would be readily accounted for. Dr. Stejneger has so clearly shown 
( Stand. Nat. Hist., Vol. IV. Birds, p. 151) how the extinction of this or 
other species might have come about that the account is here quoted in 
full: 

It seems to be a fact that when a migratory species has reached a certaiu low num- 
ber of individuals, the rapidity witli which it goes towards extinction is considerably 
increased. 

Two circumstances may tend toward this result. We know that when birds on 
their migrations get astray, having lost their route aud comrades, they are nearly 
always doomed to destruction, that fate not only overtaking single iudividuals, but 
also large flocks to the last member. 

If the safety of the wanderers, therefore, greatly depends upon their keeping their 
correct route, the safety decreases disproportionately the scarcer the species become, 
since, if the route is .poorly frequented, the younger and inexperienced travelers 
have less chance of following the right track, and more chance of getting lost, and 
consequently destroyed. The fewer the individuals, the more disconnected become 
the breeding localities, the more difficult for the birds to find each other and form 
flocks in the fall. Finally the uumber will be reduced to a few colonies, and the 
species, consequently in danger of extinction, aud a casualty, which, under ordi- 
nary circumstances, would only affect a fraction of the members, now may easily 
prove fatal to the remainder of the species. 



638 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

We need oiily suppose that during one unfortunate year nearly all the hroods were' 
destroyed hy inundations, fires, or frost, to perceive what difficulty the few birds left 
in the autumn would have in wending their way without getting astray. 

We know that the proportion of birds returning in spring is comparatively small, 
and the flocks are considerably thinned down. 

Under the circumstances presumed, there will hardly be birds left to form flocks. 
But birds used to migrate in flocks do not like or can not travel alone; hence they 
are forced to follow flocks of allied species, which may take them to localities far 
from their home. In that way a few scattered pairs may survive, and breed here and 
there, a number of years after the rest are destroyed, and such are probably those 
few Labrador Ducks which have been captured occasionally during the last twenty 
years or more. 

There is a possibility that a few such pairs may be in existence, but, however 
hardy, their fate is sealed, and perhaps not a single one will get into the hands of a 
naturalist.

THE GREAT AUK. 

(Alca impennis.) 

The Great Auk, or Garefowl (Alca impennis), was the largest mem- 
ber of the Auk family, distinguished not only by its size, but by its 
Sightlessness, enjoying the proud distinction of being the sole bird in I 
the northeru hemisphere incapable of flight. The name by which the 
Great Auk was originally and commonly known in America was Pen- 
guin, and the southern birds, now known by that title, did not receive 
this appellation until many years after. Garefowl is of Scandinavian 
origin, and comes to us by way of western Scotland. 

In color the Great Auk much resembled its lesser relative, the Ra 
zorbill, the head, neck, and back being black, and the under parts white. 
A peculiar mark of the bird was a large white spot in front of the eye, 
one old writer with a greater love of the marvelous than of truthfulness 
stating that this spot was fouud ou the right side only. The wings, 
although far too small to sustain the bird in the air, formed an admir- 
able pair of oars, the Great Auk being a most expert swimmer and 
diver, and performing even longer migrations than many of its relatives 
that were endowed with the power of flight. (Plate CIII.) Many, possi 
bly all, of the Auk family use their wings quite as much as their feet for 
propulsion under water, and they may literally be said to fly beneath the 
sea as well as over it. It has been noted that the inability of the Great 
Auk to fly was due to lack of development of the bones of the forearm and 
hand, the humerus being proportionately as long as in other Auks. 
This modification of structure was directly correlated with the aquatic 
habits of the Garefowl, for the resistance of water being vastly greater 
than that of air, a wing especially adapted for subaquatic flight would

demand less surface and more power thau a wing formed for aerial loco- 
motion. In the case of the Great Auk this demand was met by shorten- 
ing the outer portion of the wing, while other birds that use their wings 
in diving obtain as far as possible the same result by only partially open- 
ing their wings. 

The Great Auk was confined to the North Atlantic, ranging on the 
European side from Iceland to the Bay of Biscay, and on the Amer- 
ican from Greenland to Virginia, these localities marking the extreme 
limits of the bird's migrations.

but where the occurrence of the bird was probably accidental. X, places where remains of the 
Great Auk have been found in shell heaps. 

Greenland was the habitat of the Garefowl to a very limited extent, 
and the same may be said of the coast of Norway, while the southern 
limits given above were reached only during the winter migrations of 
the bird. The positively known breeding-places were few in number, 
those where the bird bred abundantly, being the Garefowl Skerries off 
the coast of Iceland and Funk Island on the Newfoundland coast. 
These islands, or more properly islets, were very similar in their general 
character, being isolated rocks, lying at some distance from shore and 
difficult of access. Of course the reason for this similarity is apparent. 
The Great Auk and its eggs formed desirable articles of food, and since 
the bird was helpless on land, it was easily captured, whence it came 
to pass at an early date that the bird was exterminated at all localities 
easy of access. Another and more important factor in the extermi- 
nation of the Auk, especially in America, is to be found in the gregarious 
habits of the bird and its predilection for certain breeding-places. This 
habit of the Garefowl is shown by other birds which are restricted in 
their breeding habitat without any apparent reason, although there may 
be some unknown cause in the nature of food-supply that might account 
for it. A good example of this is found in the Gaunet, which, although 
a bird of powerful flight, breeds at only three localities on the eastern 
coast of America, and in Europe crosses the North Sea to nest in Scot- 



640 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

laud, when localities seemiugly quite as favorable exist along the shores 
of Norway. There were apparently plenty of suitable breeding- grounds 
for the Great Auk in Maine and Labrador, but had the bird bred in small 
colonies at localities scattered along this wide expanse of territory, it 
would have been in existence to-day. 

The most important European breeding place of the Garefowl was 
an islet 25 miles off Reykjaues, Iceland, where, for many years, it led 
a somewhat precarious existence, several times seeming to have been 
so reduced in numbers that expeditions in search of birds and eggs 
were not worth the risk. Still the bird would have existed in this 
locality many years longer than it did, but for volcanic disturbances in 
March, 1830, during which the Geirfuglasker sank beneath the sea 
compelling the existing Garefowl to seek new-breeding places. Most 
of them appear to have moved to an islet by the name of Eldey, 
and this being near the coast and more accessible, the few remaining 
Great Auks were in the course of fourteen years all killed, the last pair 
being taken about the 3d of June, 1844, this being the last authentic 
record of the Great Auk in Europe. It was from this locality that 
most of the skins now extant were obtained, only one mounted speci- 
men being recorded from American localities, although nearly all 
skeletons have come from Newfoundland. The history of the Great 
Auk in America may be said to date from 1534, when, on May 21, two 
boat's crews from Carrier's vessels lauded on Funk Island, and, as we 
are told, "In lesse than halfe an hour we filled two boats full of them, 
as if they had bene stones. So that besides them which we did eat 
fresh, every ship did powder and salt five or sixe barrels of them." The 
Great Auk having thus been apprized of the advent of civi ization in 
the regular manner, continued to be utilized by all subsequent visitors. 
The French fishermen depended very largely on the Great Auks to 
supply them with provisions; passing ships touched at Funk Island 
for supplies; the early colonists barreled them up for wiuter use, and the 
great abundance of the birds was set forth among other inducements t» 
encourage emigration to Newfoundland. The immense numbers of the 
Auks may be inferred from the fact that they withstood these drains for 
more than two centuries, although laying but a single egg, and conse- 
quently increasing but slowly under the most favorable circumstances. 
Finally some one conceived the idea of killing the Garefowl for their 
feathers, and this sealed its fate. When and where the scheme origin- 
ated, and how long the slaughter lasted, we know not, for the matter 
is rather one of general report than of recorded fact, although in this 
instance circumstantial evidence bears witness to the truth of Cart- 
wright's statement that it was customary for several crews of men to 
pass the summer on Funk Island solely to slay the Great Auks for 
their feathers. That the birds were slain by millions ; that their bodies 
were left to molder where they were killed ; that stone pens were erected ; 
and that for some purpose frequent and long continued fires were built

on Funk Island, is indisputable. This locality has been but thrice, 
visited by naturalists, the last time in the summer of L887, by a party 
from the U. S. National Museum, who, by the aid of the U. S. Fish 
Commission, were enabled to obtain much information in regard to this 
interesting spot, and to make very extensive collections of remains of 
the Great Auk. Just when the Great Auk ceased to exist in America 
is unknown, for there were few naturalists on this side of the water 
when the Garefowl was being done to the death ; but the extinction took 
place not far from 1840, almost coincidently with the extermination of 
the bird in Europe. Few birds have received more attention than has 
the Great Auk since it became extinct, and it has been the subject of 
numerous papers, both popular and scientific, while its remains bring 
extravagant prices whenever chance brings them into the market. The 
last skeleton sold brought $000, the last skin $650, while an egg brought 
$1,250, and then was resold for the round sum of $1,500.

642 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The specific name otperspicillatm, spectacled, was bestowed upon tin 
bird of Pallas on account of the broad ring of bare, white skin surroundl 
ing the eyes. So far as is kuowu, the bird was found only on Bering 
Island, where it was discovered by Steller in 1741, at the time of Ben 
ing's unfortunate shipwreck, when the bird was largely used for foot 
by the survivors. 

The known history of Pallas' Cormorant is extremely brief, and has| 
been so well recorded by Dr. Stejneger in the Proceedings of the U. S 
National Museum for 1888, that one can not possibly do better than tc 
quote his account. Omitting the technical portion, it is as follows : 

It seems as if the very causes which terminated the existance of the Great Aull 
worked the same result in Pallas' Cormorant, and it is even probable that if the lattei I 
at some early period, also inhabited the other Aleutian Islands, as is most likely, vol I 
canic eruptions may have played a role in this drama as well as in that of the Greal 
Auk. True, the latter was entirely deprived of its power of flight, but it is evident 
both from the measurements of the skins as well as of those of the bones, given below. 1 
that the wings of the cormorant were disproportionately small. Steller speaks of its I 
great bulk of body and its weight, which varied between 1'2 and 14 pounds, so that 
one single bird was sufficient for three starving men of the shipwrecked crew. 

With this bulk it combined an unusual "stoliditas," but it is pretty clear that this 
stupidity, which made them such an easy prey, was due more to their slowness ol 
locomotion on laud and in the air thau to any special temperament or dullness of in- 
tellect. The natives of Bering Island inform me that the meat of this species was 
particularly palatable compared with that of its congeners, aud that, consequently,] 
during the long winter, when other fresh meat thau that of the cormorants was ob- 
tainable, it was used as food in preference to any other. In brief, all the circumstances 
combined to make short work at exterminating this bird at its last refuge, for there 
is no evidence that it has ever been found during historical times in any other locality 
than Bering Island. The result was that Pallas' cormorant, which was found by 
Steller and his shipwrecked comrades on that desolate island in 1741, aud which at 
that time— that is, before man ever visited its rocky shores — occurred there in great 
numbers, "frequentissimi," as Steller says, became extinct in about one hundred years 
from its discovery. The history of this bird forms au interesting parallel to that of 
the great northern sea-cow {Rytina gigas). 

Up to 1837 or 1839 Steller seems to have been the only naturalist who had seen thisl 
bird, for, although naming it in his Zoographia, all Pallas knew of the species was 
derived from Steller's observations, whose description he merely quotes. It is, then, 
safe to conclude that it was not among the many water birds collected by Billing's 
expedition, which brought such rich spoils home from the Kurilesaud the Aleutian 
Island, but which did not touch at Bering Island. In the above mentioned year 
Captain Belcher, with the Sulphur, visited Sitka, and was there presented by Kupria- 
noff, the Russian governor, with one of the specimens of this bird in his possession. 
This specimen is evidently the one now in the British Museum, while the others w T ent 
to the St. Petersburg Academy, from which one was again secured by the Leyden 
Museum. Although obtained from the governor in Sitka, there is nothing to indicate | 
whence came the specimens ; but inasmuch as Bering Island at that time belonged 
to the administrative district of Sitka, at which port all the furs were received from 
that island before being shipped to Europe; all vessels from Bering Island conse- 
quently first stopping at Sitka, there is every probability that the specimens in ques- 
tion were collected on that island. 

During my circumnavigation of Bering Island I lauded on September 1, 1882, at 
Pestshanij Mys near the northwestern extremity of the island. Ascending the steep

coast escarpment which is here about 35 feet high, I found near the edge of the ter- 
rasse a rather extensive deposit of bones of various mammals and birds arranged in 
thin layers of sand and sod alternating. The average thickness of the deposit was 
about 2 feet, and the present area covered in the neighborhood of 600 square feet, 
though it was evident that it was formerly of much greater extent, the ocean having 
encroached upon the land and carried away great portions of the terrasse. The bones 
were in fairly good condition, some of the smaller and delicate ones even excellently 
well preserved, and none of them showed signs of violence. There were bones of the 
Arctic Fox, the Sea Otter, the Sea Lion, and other species of seals, as well as various 
kinds of water birds. Among the Litter a particularly large pelvis of a Phalacro- 
corax at once attracted my attention, and as I had had Pallas' Cormorant on my mind 
since I started from Washington, I was not slow in concluding that I had to do with 
the bones of this bird. Had I had time to dig out the whole deposit I should prob- 
ably have obtained more boues, but with the above suspicion I did as much digging 
and collected as many bird bones as the circumstances would allow. 

The boues thus obtained, twenty-three in number, are the only por- 
tions of the skeleton known to science, all that now exists of Pallas' 
Cormorant being- four mounted specimens and a handful of boues. 
There is a slight possibility that Pallas' Cormorant may yet be found 
about some of the small, uninhabited islands towards the western end 
of the Aleutian chain, but this is merely a possibility and nothing 
more.

THE GALAPAGOS ANT) MASCARENE TORTOISES. 

The Galapagos Archipelago, which comprises fifteen small islands, 
lying directly on the equator, was so christened by the Spaniards of the 
sixteenth century on account of the abundance of great, black tortoises 
(galapago) found there. (Plate CIV.) These turtles, of which there are 
several closely related species inhabiting various islands of the group, 
are typical land-tortoises of the genus Testudo, characterized by a high, 
arched carapace, and club feet. The nearest relatives of the Galapagos 
tortoises are found in the island of Aldabra, to the north and west of 
Madagascar, and in the Seychelles (see map 3), whither they were in- 
troduced from Aldabra. There were — the past tense is painful— closely 
allied species inhabiting the Mascarene Islands, but these were long 
since " eaten off the face of the.earth by gluttonous man " and the place 
thereof knoweth them no more. The same fate is impending over the 
Galapagos tortoises, and sooner or later they will live only in the name 
of their former abiding place. 

The Galapagos tortoises and their allies present a doubly interesting 
instance of the peculiar geographical distribution of animals. Not only 
arc they as a group confined to small islands remote from one another 
and from the continent, but, with one exception, each species of tortoise 
is restricted to a single island.

REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



In the ease of the Mascarene tortoises tbis is not so singular, as 
Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodriguez are some distance apart; but the 
Galapagos tortoises inhabit islands most of which are in sight of one ' 
another, and some separated by only 8 or 10 miles of sea.

Map 6— The distribution of Galapagos Tortoises. 

The exception noted above to the rule that a given island possesses 
but a single species of tortoise, is Albemarle Island, which has two, but 
in this instance the island is divided by lava streams whose broken ir- 
regular surfaces present impassible barriers to such creatures as tor- 
toises. It is unfortunate, in view of the interest attached to the subject, 
that the exact locality of many of the tortoises brought from the Gala- 
pagos Islands should be unknown, the more that unless the problem 
of their distribution is soon settled it never can be. Dr. Gunther 
enumerates six species, the first two of which are certainly known to 
have come from the islands assigned to them, two are in a measure 
conjectural, and two are unknown. Three, probably four, species are 
in the collection of the U. S. National Museum, but in this case a little 
uncertainty hangs over the exact locality they came from, owing to the 
fact that several were obtained at Chatham Island, whither they were 
brought from other islands of the archipelago. One very large indi- 
vidual, however, was obtained at Abingdon Island, where the tortoises 
are probably extinct, the weathered skeleton having fortunately been 
preserved in a tolerably complete condition. The Galapagos tortoises 
are vegetable feeders, living largely on succulent cactus, which serves 
the double purpose of food and driuk. They are very fond of water, 
and although seeming to thrive on the smaller islands which are with- 
out springs, make long pilgrimages to reach the wells on the upper 
portions of the large islands. Although the tortoises travel day and 
night while on these journeys, owing to their proverbially slow rate of 
speed (three or four miles an hour) it requires two or three days to 
make the trip. Regular roads, similar to those that would be made by 
a low-bodied cart, branch out from the springs in every direction, lead- 
ing from them to the coast, and it was by following up these well-trav- 
eled paths that the Spaniards first discovered the watering places. 
These tortoises are currently reported to be totally deaf, aud Porter

records that they took no notice even of the report of a gun, while Dar- 
win states that they seemed quite unaware of any approach from the 
rear, but would draw in their extremities with a haul hiss as soon as they 
saw him. Dampier, who visited the Galapagos group in 1080, was per- 
haps the lirst to publish an account of the tortoises that supplied him 
with fresh provisions, as they did many a mariner after him, these 
creatures being indeed ideal live stock for sailors' purposes, requiring 
little care and no food, yet existing on this diet for three or four months. 
Dampier does not tell us from what islands he obtained his tortoises, but 
in his time they must have been abundant throughout the entire Archi- 
pelago. Occasional mention is made of the Galapagos tortoises by ves- 
sels which stopped there for provisions and water, and many more 
touched there without putting their visits on record. In 1813 Porter, 
of the celebrated Essex, who visited the islands for the purpose of way- 
laying British whaling vessels, obtained tortoises abundantly on Hoods, 
Marlborough, James. Charles, and Indefatigable Islands, but although 
only shells and bones were seen on Chatham Island, the tortoises must 
still have been numerous there, since they still exist in that locality. 
Porter was the first to note the fact that differences existed between 
the tortoises from the various islands. In 1835, during the now famous 
voyage of the Beagle, Darwin found the tortoises still numerous on 
Chatham, Charles, and James Islands, although he notes that the 
numbers had been much reduced, owing to quantities taken by the 
whalers and by parties from the mainland, who visited the islands for 
the purpose of salting tortoise meat and making oil from the fat. II. 
M. S. Herald in 1810 reported the tortoises extinct on Charles Island, 
and in 1875 Captain Cookson says that only a few individuals were left 
on Chatham Island, and that they were much lessened in numbers on 
Hood, James, and Indefatigable Islands, although plentiful in Albe- 
marle and Abingdon. Small wonder that the ranks of these slow-grow- 
ing, slower-paced reptiles should be getting thinned out, when we read 
that vessels have taken away as many as seven hundred at one time, 
and that tiie crew of a frigate captured two hundred in a single day. 
Of course these figures are exceptional, yet prior to 1870 as many as 
forty or fifty whalers annually visited the islands, stopping there some 
time and carrying away a hundred or so of tortoises when they de- 
parted, the number thus taken from Charles Island alone being esti- 
mated at 6,000, the total number from all the islands reaching several 
millions. 

In J 829 the Government of Ecuador established a penal colony on 
Charles Island, whose members relied principally upon the tortoises to 
keen them in fresh meat and the orchilla* gatherers, who visit the

species of lichen, from which a purple dye is obtained. 

The lichen formed a portion of the food of the tortoises, and it. is rather interesting 
that, having first aided in their increase, it should later on prove an important, factor 
in their destruction.

islands annually, count upon these animals to furnish them with a large 
proportion of their supplies. 

The manufacture of tortoise oil must be credited with having caused 
the destruction of large numbers of tortoises, and as late as 1875 Cap- 
tain Cooksou found a party of seven engaged in its preparation on Al- 
bemarle Island. In twelve months they had made 3,000 gallons, a 
quantity that probably represented an equal number of tortoises, lor 
though 5 or 6 gallons have been obtained from unusually large and fat 
animals, the average yield is about 1 gallon. Dogs, too, introduced by 
the colonists, have played their customary role in the extirpating pro- 
cess, chiefly by destroying the young tortoises, which they watch for and 
devour as soon as hatched, but also by killing animals of considerable 
size. With so many enemies, no means of defense, and no power of 
escape by flight, it is surprising that any tortoises should to-day exist, 
and the fact that they are not yet exterminated shows how wonderfully 
abundant they must have been when the islands were discovered. 

In 1888 the IT. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross succeeded in 
obtaining a limited number of tortoises, but they were comparatively 
small, mostly mere infants of 10 or 20 pounds weight, although one 
specimen weighing about 40 pounds was secured. This is a sad falling 
off from former days, for in Darwin's time individuals weighing 200 
pounds were not uncommon, while the governor of the penal colony 
told Darwin that he had seen tortoises so large that it required six or 
eight men to lift one from the ground, a statement not at all incredible, 
since a tortoise from Aldabra turned the scales at 870 pounds. The 
decline in weight is due to the fact that the tortoises are killed while 
they are still young and before they have had time to attain any con- 
siderable size. Turtles live to a great age (the specimen from Aldabra 
was known to be over eighty) and like other reptiles continue to grow 
throughout life, so that great size is an indication of corresponding age. 
A tortoise obtained by Captain Cooksou, estimated by an old tortoise 
hunter to be four years old, weighed only 9 ounces, so that the rate of 
growth would seem to be more rapid in old rather than in young indi- 
viduals. 

Probably no more large tortoises will come from the Galapagos group, 
and though the race may linger for some time longer, it will ultimately 
become extinct. The story of the Mascarene tortoises is soon told. 
Van Neck, the discoverer of the Dodo, found them abundant in Mauri- 
tius at the time of his visit in 1598, and he tells us that some were of 
such immense size that six men could be seated in one shell. In 1618 
Bontekoe, on a trip to Bourbon, took twenty-four tortoises beneath a 
single tree, a statement which shows how numerous they then were. 
Bodriguez must, however, have been the headquarters of these ani- 
mals, for Leguat says : "There are such plenty of laud turtles in this 
isle that sometimes you see two or three thousand of them in a drove, 
so that you may go above a hundred paces on their backs."

Iii 17G1 vessels were employed in transplanting tortoises from Rodri- 
guez to the Duteh colony at Mauritius, where they were used iu the 
hospital and in exchange for various commodities with the Dutch East 
Indiam en who frequently touched there. In the early part of the pres- 
ent century the race seems to have become extinct, and save the few 
bones rescued from the marshes of Mauritius and the caves of Rodri- 
guez, nothing is left to show that these large and formerly abundant 
tortoises ever existed.

THE TILE FISH. 

( LoplwlaUlus ckameleonticeps.) 

The tile fish is the largest member of a small family of fishes (the 
Latilidce), most of which are inhabitants of tropical or subtropical 
waters, although the tile fish itself ranged northwards to the latitude 
of Philadelphia. The tile fish was rather brilliantly colored, being 
pale-violet above and whitish below, with numerous markings of pale 
yellow. (Plate V.) In size it varied from five to forty pounds, and 
it was au inhabitant of moderately deep water, being found at a depth 
of from ninety to one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Up to 187!) 
the tile fish was unknown, and its discovery may be said to have been 
accidental. In May, 1879, Captain Kirby, of the schooner Wm. V. 
Hutching8, while trawling* for cod to the southward of Nantucket, took 
5,000 pounds of a fish not only new to him but new to science. The 
greater part of the fish taken on the first haul of the trawls were thrown 
away, but as the samples that had been kept proved, on being cooked, 
to be most excellent eating, those subsequently taken were salted down, 
and when taken to Gloucester a portion w T as smoked. In July, 1879, 
more tile fish were taken — this time on hand lines — by Captain Dempsey, 
of the schooner Clara F. Friend, while trying for cod, but as there were 
no indications of the latter being present, Captain Dempsey, who natur- 
ally preferred to deal with fish with which he was acquainted, proceeded 
to other grounds, in 1880 and 1881, while engaged in exploring the

sea-bottom of the southern coast of New England, the United State,-; 
Fish Commission steamer Fish Hatch took tile fish on several occasions 
at depths of from 70 to 134 fathoms. The indications of the apparent 
abundance of a new and edible fish of large size made Professor Baird 
desirous of obtaining fuller knowledge of its habits and habitat, in the 
hope that it might readily be taken in large numbers and prove an im- 
portant addition to the list of food fishes Unfortunately the fish com- 
mission had not yet built the schooner Grampus, so, having no vessel 
especially adapted for fishery research and prepared to encounter all 
weather, it was necessary to charter a fishing smack for the work. 
Unfortunately, too, bad or threatening weather seemed to have been 
chartered with the smack, and only a brief and unsatisfactory trial 
could be made on the tile fish-ground, so that research was of necessity 
postponed until 1882. In the months of March and April, 1882, ves- 
sels arriving at Philadelphia, New York, and Boston reported having 
passed large numbers of dead or dying fish scattered over an area of 
many miles, and from descriptions and the occasional specimens brought 
in, it was evident that the great majority of these were tile fish. Nat- 
urally these fish were not evenly distributed over all the area in which 
they were seen, some observers reporting them as scattering, and others 
as at times so numerous that there would be as many as fifty on the

space of a rod square. As one account after another came in it became 
apparent that a vast destruction offish had taken place, for vessels re- 
ported having sailed for 40, 50, and 00 miles through floating fish ; and 
in one case the schooner Navarino plowed for no less than 150 miles 
through waters dotted as far as the eye could reach with dying fishes. 
From careful computations made by Capt. J. W. Collins, it seems that 
an area of from 5,000 to 7,500 square statute miles were so thickly cov- 
ered with dead or dying fish that their numbers must have exceeded the 
enormous number of one billion. As there were no signs of any dis- 
ease, and no parasites found on the fish brought in for examination, 
their death could not have been brought about by either of these causes ; 



ANIMALS RECENTLY EXTINCT. (549 

and many conjectures were made as lo the reason of this wholesale 
destruction of deep-water fishes, such as would ordinarily be unaffected 
by conditions prevailing at the surface, submarine volcanoes, heat, 
cold, and poisonous gases being variously brought forward to account for 
the loss of life. 

Professor Verrill has noted the occurrence of a strip of water, having 
a temperature of 48° to 50° Far., lying on the border of the Gulf-Stream 
slope, sandwiched in between the Arctic current on the one hand and 
the cold depths of the sea on the other. During 1880 and 1881 Pro- 
fessor Verrill dredged along the Gulf-Stream slope, obtaining in this 
warm belt, as he terms it, many species of invertebrates characteristic 
of more southern localities. In 1882 the same species were scarce or 
totally absent from places where they had previously been abundant, 
and this taken in connection with the occurrence of heavy northerly 
gales and the presence of much inshore ice at the north, leaves little 
doubt that some unusual lowering of temperature in the warm belt 
brought immediate death to many of its inhabitants. This, is the more 
probable, as it is a well-known fact that sudden increase of cold will 
bring many fish to the surface in a benumbed or dying condition, and 
there are no indications of any shock or earthquake having occurred at 
the time the dead fish were first noticed. Whether the entire race of 
tile fish has become extinct, or whether they will later on be discov- 
ered on grounds to the southward of the localities where they were 
formerly found, it is impossible to say. Certain it is that none have 
been taken since the spring of 1882, although in the autumn of that 
year Captain Collins made careful trials in their former habitat with 
a view of ascertaining if any remained there. It is no less singular 
that so large and plentiful a fish should have remained so long un- 
known than that it should disappear almost as yoon asit was discovered. 
Should the tile fish appear no more, it will be one of the few animals 
exterminated in modern times, for whose extinction man is in no ways 
accountable.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN RAIL AND TRACK, AS ILLUS- 
TRATED BY THE COLLECTION IN THE U. S, NATIONAL MUSEUM. ■ 



By J. Elfreth Watkins, 
Curator of the Department of Transportation and Engineering. 



In the brief report upon the section of steam transportation for the 
year 1887, a statement was made to the effect that considerable in- 
formation had been secured which it was hoped to use "in preparing - a 
series of models to illustrate the beginnings and development of the 
English and American systems of track. 

"While illustrated histories of the steamboat and locomotive are 
numerous, I am not aware that any systematic attempt has been made 
to preserve the history of the development of the systems of permanent 
way which, after many years of experiment, are now being reduced to 
a series of standards depending on the traffic." (Report of U. S. 
National Museum, 1887, p. 79.) 

These expectations were realized to a sufficient extent to warrant 
the preparation of the series of original rail sections, models, and 
drawings to illustrate the origin and development of American perma- 
nent way for the Exposition at Cincinnati in 1888. 

The interest manifested in that collection led me to present a paper 
entitled "The Development of the American Rail and Track" at the 
annual convention of the American Society of Civil Engineers, at Sea 
Bright, New Jersey, June 21, 1889. This will appear in the transac- 
tions of that society during the coming year.* 

At the conclusion of that paper I took occasion to state that in its 
preparation " I preferred to confine myself to a description of such rails 
as are represented by original sections, models, or drawings in the 
section of transportation and engineering in the U. S. National 
Museum." 

" I am fully conscious that I have been compelled to overlook many 
things which are of great historical interest, owing to the fact that our 
collection is small — only a nucleus in reality."

652 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Although some additions to the collection have since been made, a 
large portion of the facts here stated, together with many of the illus- 
trations, also appear in the original paper. 

GOOD TRACK AS IMPORTANT AS THE LOCOMOTIVE. 

As the improved wagon roads in the past made it practicable to 
transfer the burden from the pack mule to the wheel vehicle, and the 
traveler from the saddle horse to the light, comfortable, and rapidly 
moving carriage, so the development of the iron railway of the nine- 
teenth century has made it possible for us to enjoy the safety, speed, 
and comfort of the express train of to-day, drawn by the fleet and 
powerful locomotive. 

In considering the improvement in methods of transportation, I am 
led to think that there is a tendency to overestimate the benefits aris- 
ing from the invention and improvement of the locomotive, and to 
overlook what has been done by those who devoted time aud thought 
to the development of the various systems of permanent way. 

The improvement made in track construction in England during the 
first quarter or the century made the introduction of the locomotive 
there possible. 

Trevithick's locomotive of 1804, crude as it was, would have been 
much more successful, and might have brought him much greater fame 
as one of the first inventors of the locomotive, had the track upon 
which it ran been constructed according to modern methods. 

Long before the locomotive was a practical machine the advantages 
of the cast-iron tramroad were fully appreciated. 

By careful calculation a distinguished London engineer, in 1802, 
found that while it cost 3s. 4tf. per ton per mile to transport bulky 
freight over turnpikes, the cost on iron horse tramroads was only one- 
tenth, M. 

George Stephenson, while president of the "British Carrying Com- 
panies," stated "that by the introduction of the horse tramroad the 
monthly expense of that company for coal carriage alone had been re- 
duced from £1200 to £300. 

An edition of " Wood's Treatise of Railroads," published in 1830, 
which was one of the earliest and most reliable standard works on 
railroad subjects, calls attention to the economical operation of the 
coal railroad, miles loug, near Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, then 
operated by horse power, and states that by this method "it has re- 
paid its whole cost since 1827." 

On a large proportion of the American railways projected before 
1830, it was intended that horse power should be used. 

In Austria the advantages of a horse tramway were also understood. 

In 1828 thirty-nine miles of the horse railway from Budweis to Lintz — 
constructed across the mountains which separate the Moldau and the 
Danube — was opened to traffic. This road was extended 41 miles

farther iu 1832, aud for many years paid a dividend of 5 per cent, upon 
a capitalization of $10,000 a mile, being subsequently increased to a 
length of 130 miles in 1839. 

The modern horse railways in our cities and their suburbs earn hand- 
some dividends by carrying passengers at a lower fare per mile than 
the steam, railway companies find profitable. 

THE IRON COAL ROAD. 

The circumstances connected with the origin of the iron railroad, 
and particularly the relations which existed between coal, iron and the 
railway in the beginning, are of the greatest interest. Man's physical 
necessities exert a powerful influence upon the inventive faculties, and 
the trite proverb arising therefrom is nowhere better exemplified than 
in the history of the conception, birth, aud growth of the railroad. 

The demand for a new fuel to replace the faggot and the log was 
the necessity that became more and more urgent as the forest disap- 
peared to satisfy the demands of a dense population. This condition 
of affairs directed thought toward devising improved methods for 
transporting pit coal from the collieries of Great Britain to the adja- 
cent navigable streams or near seaports. 

Although coal had been mined in England as early as the middle of 
the ninth century, it was not until 1259 that Henry III granted the 
privilege of digging coal to certain persons in Newcastle. By the be- 
ginning of the fourteenth century it had become an important article 
of export, and was called " sea cole," owiug to the fact that it was 
shipped by vessels to various ports. 

EARLY USE OF IRON. 

Several methods of iron making were understood and practiced by 
the ancients. 

The Bible bears evidence iu many texts to the high esteem in which 
the iron worker was held. Tubal Cain is described in Genesis iv as 
"an instructor of every artifice in brass aud iron." In alluding to the 
Israelites in Deuteronomy iv is the statement: "For the Lord hath 
taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of 
Egypt." 

Processes of making iron were known to the Babylonians and Assyr- 
ians. The stones in the celebrated bridge said to have been built by 
Nitocris were held together by bands of iron kept in place by molten 
lead. "Among the ruins of Sargon's palace objects of iron aud bronze, 
such as hooks and rings, chains, pickaxes, hammers, ploughshares, 
weapons, fragments of chariots, and tools of all sorts were picked up." 

The Phoenicians, Persians, and even the Chinese were acquainted 
with processes of forging iron centuries before the Christian era; and 
in India, iu the temple of Kuttub at Delhi, there stands a pillar of solid 



654 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUxM, 1889. 

forged iron over 16 inches in diameter and nearly 60 feet high, supposed 
to have been erected in the third century. 

But these methods must be included among the lost arts — arts lost in 
the great abyss of the middle ages, which swallowed up so many of the 
results of the skill and ingenuity of the ancient world. 

But among the Greeks and the ancient nations of the Orient, as we 
learn from Homer, the early historians, and the latest inscriptions and 
archaeological discoveries, iron was once regarded as a precious metal. 
Homer's elaborate description of the shield of Achilles, forged by Vul- 
can, undoubtedly shows that the art of working iron was fully under- 
stood in that semifabulous epoch.* 

Iron first came into use in the arts and manufactures when Spain 
flourished under the Visigoths, who are said to have derived it from 
their ancestors, the Scythians, of whose history so little is definitely 
known. Spanish iron brought high prices for many years. 

THE IRON INDUSTRY IN ENGLAND. 

Early in the fifteenth century many blast furnaces were in existence 
in France, and soon afterward they were introduced in Sussex, Kent, 
and Surrey, in England, and this gave impetus to the iron industry of 
England. As the processes of extracting iron from various ores be- 
came more fully understood, the demand increased, and in order to 
keep up the supply great inroads were made each year upon the forests 
for fuel. 

During the reign of Queen Elizabeth (1558-1603) the iron industry 
increased so rapidly that the consumption of wood became a most seri- 
ous matter, as iron was then smelted exclusively by charcoal. 

The destruction of the forests was so rapid that Parliament passed 
acts in 1558, 1581, and 1584 restricting the cutting of wood for char- 
coal, and thus the iron industry languished for over a century. 

In the mean time thought had been directed to the processes of smelt- 
ing iron with pit coal. Sturdevant's method, although patented in 1611, 
was not practicable; and Dudley, who eight years after solved the prob- 
lem with some success, was so much abused by the charcoal smelters, 
that fearing bodily injury he too abandoned the business. Nothing 
further seems to have been done toward using coal for smelting iron ore 
in England during the seventeenth century. 

THE IRON INDUSTRY IN AMERICA. 

As early as 1621 a considerable quantity of iron was produced in Vir- 
ginia, and that colony led the industry until 1628, when Massachusetts 
forged ahead. 

As wood fuel was plenty in America the industry grew so rapidly 
that Parliament passed an act in 1660 prohibiting the exportation of 



* Manual of Oriental Antiquities, Ernest, Babelen, p. 125. 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN RAIL AND TRACK. 655 

iron from the colonies except in English ships; and in 1679 a duty of 
10s. was imposed by the British Government upon each ton of pig iron 
exported. 

In 1750, about 3,500 tons of pig iron having been imported into Eng- 
land from America, a law was passed by Parliament removing this 
duty, but prohibiting all persons in the colonies, under penalty of £200, 
from erecting a forge or working a tilt hammer or a rolling mill. This 
was one of the "grievances" that instigated the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence. 

The historian Bancroft, commenting on this fact, says : 

America abounded in iron ore ; its unwrpught iron was excluded from the English 
market, and its people were rapidly gaining skill at the furnace and forge. Iu Feb- 
ruary, 1750, the subject engaged the attention of the House of Commons. After a 
few days' deliberation a bill was brought in which permitted American iron in its 
rudest forms to be imported duty free; but now that the nailers in the colonies could 
afford spikes and large nails cheaper than the English, it forbade the smiths of Amer- 
ica to erect any mills for slitting or rolling iron, or any plating forge to work with a 
tilt.* 

In 17G1 less than 17,000 tons of iron had been made in all Great Brit- 
ain and over 4,500 tons had been imported from America. 

COAL-MINE TRAMROADS. 

The earliest railways were laid in the coal mines and from the mines 
to the adjacent water courses. These ways consisted of squared timber 
rails laid in the ground, held to gauge by cross timbers, to which they 
were fastened by wooden pins. 

Roger North in 1072, in his biography of his brother Francis, the 
Lord Chancellor, describes a wooden railway which he had seen at 
Newcastle during the reign of Charles II, as follows: "The manner 
of the carriage is by laying rails of timber from the colliery down to 
the river exactly straight and parallel, and bulky carts are made with 
rowlets fitting these rails, whereby the carriage is so easy that one 
horse will draw 4 or 5 chaldrons of coals." The Newcastle chaldron 
weighed 5,936 pounds, so that one horse hauled 8 or 9 tons. 

EARLY AMERICAN COAL MINES. 

Coal was mined in America as early as 1770 on the James River in 
Virginia, and was used at the Westham foundry to manufacture shot 
and shell during the Revolutionary War. 



"Theexacl wording of the act as finally passed was as follows: "And that pig 
and bar iron in his Majesty's colonies in America may be further manufactured in 
this kingdom, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after 
the 24th day of June, 1750, no mill or other engine for slitting or rolling of iron, or 
any plating forge to work with a tilt hammer, or any furnace for making steel, 
shall be erected, or after such erection continued in His Majesty's colonies in America ; 
and if any person or persons shall erect or cause to bo erected, or after such erection 
continue, or cause to be con! inued, in any of the said colonies, any such mill, engine, 
forgo or furnace, every person or persons so offending shall, for every such mill, 
engine, forge or furnace, forfeit tin: sum of '2(H) pounds lawful money of Great 
Britain."

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



Ashbel Welch, in the Presidential address at the annual convention 
of the American Society of Civil Engineers at Washington in 1882 
states that, "About the year 1817 Josiah White and Erskine Hazard 
commenced the improvement of the Lehigh River, and made other 
preparations to inaugurate the anthracite coal trade. In 1820 they sent 
to market 305 tons, which was the beginning of the regular anthracite 
coal trade of America." 

Before 1825 coal mining commenced to be an industry in the Schuyl- 
kill aud Lehigh regions. In this country, as in England, the earliest 
railroads were built in and from the coal mines at Mauch Chunk, 
Houesdale, aud Pottsville in Pennsylvania and Chesterfield in Vir- 
ginia to the nearest navigable streams. 

The first locomotive that ever turned a driving wheel on a railroad 
on the Western Contineut was imported from England in 1829,* for use 
on the Delaware aud Hudson Canal Company's coal road at Houesdale, 
Pennsylvania* 

As the supply of coal was increased by improved methods of mining 
and cheaper means of transportation, it gradually superseded charcoal 
in the manufacture of iron. The cost of pig iron was reduced from £10 
10s. in 1000 to £3 in 1700, and the price did not vary much from this 
until the American Revolution cut off the supply of iron that England 
had been receiving from the colonies. This was several years before 
the introduction of good steam pumping engines, which between 1775 
aud 1790 — through the improvements aud inventions made by Watt in 
the engines of Savery and Kewcomen — reached such a degree of per- 
fection that good steam pumps were put in every prominent colliery, 
and the amount of coal mined reached enormous proportions as the cost 
of mining it was lessened.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN RAH, AND TRACK.

Thus, even before the successful introduction of the locomotive, coal, 
iron, and the railroad had become three equally important factors in 
the creation of the great systems of transportation, which have made 
our prosperity and the higher civilization of to day possible. 

CAST IRON FIRST USED FOR RAILS IN ENOLAND. 

The price of iron was materially reduced as coal became cheap and 
abundant, and at length it became possible to use it in the construction 
of rails. The earliest iron used in track construction was cast in plates 
3 or 4 feet long, 2 or 3 inches wide, and one-half or three-fourths of an 
inch thick. These plates were spiked on top of the wooden stringer 
rail where, the wear was the greatest. 

As timber was dear in England at the close of the last century, many 
attempts were made to devise a cast-iron rail that should suit the traffic 
of the English tram roads. 

We have in the collections several models of the cast-iron rails that 
were used from 1789 to 18L0. A fair impression can be obtained of the 
prude ideas that the early English tramway contractors had in regard 
to rails from an examination of the drawings.

Jessop, mine engineer, and laid ou a road in Loughborough. The rail 
was fish- bellied, and at first was not supported by a chair, the wood or

stone block being hewn to lit the end of the rail. Near the ends the rail 
had a flat projecting base, in which there were holes for the bolts which 
fastened them to the wooden block or sleeper.

the rail, having two bolts through the stem of the rail at each joint. 
They were laid on the Lawson Main Colliery Road, New-Castle-on-Tync, 
England, by Mr. Barnes, and were at first supported by timber but 
finally by stone blocks.

was thus dispensed with. These rails were about 5 inches wide, and 
weighed 42 pounds per yard.

joined the rails together, at the same time fastening tuein to the cast- 
iron chair. A large portion of the Stockton and Darlington Railroad 
was laid with this rail in 1825. 

ROLLED IRON KAILS INTRODUCED. 

Early in this century inventive genius increased the power of the 
stationary engine and the efficiency of the steam blast and of the ma- 
chinery for working and handling iron. 

The puddling furnace, first used in 1784, was radically improved by 
Henry Cort about the beginning of the century. He also invented and 
introduced the rolling mill about the same time, so that it became pos-

sible to roll iron rails cheaply. These were at first rolled in lengths of 
about 12 feet. Drawings from the models of the early English rolled 
rails are shown.

sleepers. The wedge form is used because the strength of a rail is 
always proportioned to the square of its breadth and depth. Hence 
this (wedge) form of rail possesses all the strength of a cube equal to 
its square. The joints are made with a pin." Birkeushaw showed 
great ingenuity in designing the rolls by which these rails were fairly 
rolled in lengths of 18 feet. Cast bars were soon after dispensed with.

near Newark, New Jersey, in 1831. It was the original design to lay 
the whole Portage Railroad with stone blocks and "f rails. 

THE ORIGIN OF THE AMERICAN RAIL iND TRACK. 

In 1825-27 a few isolated coal tramroads existed in the mining re- 
gions in Pennsylvania aud Virginia and in the stone quarries in Massa- 
chusetts. These roads were laid with wooden rails, capped with thin 
merchant bar iron. About this time the Pennsylvania Society for the 
Promotion of Internal Improvement sent an engineer abroad to exam- 
ine the English railways. The fully illustrated report made by Wil- 
liam Strickland, published during the year 1S2G, shows that rapid ad- 
vances in track construction had been made in Great Britain during 
the preceding decade, notwithstanding the fact that comparatively few 
locomotives were at work and only one railway for general traffic had 
been opened. 

This report, without doubt, contained the most trustworthy informa- 
tion obtainable at that time by American railway projectors. 

But America presented a very different problem from England to the 
pioneer railway builders. Eugland was an old country, rich in com- 
merce and foremost in manufactures, of comparatively small area and 
very densely settled, having a population of nearly two hundred to the 
square mile of territory, while the population of the whole United States 
was less than four to the square mile. In the seven States, Connecti- 
cut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, 
and Maryland, where most of the early railways were projected, the 
average population was a little over thirty-five to the square mile. 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN KAIL AND TRACK. 663 

ENGLISH ^ND AMERICAN ENGINEERS. 

The British railway projectors had the advantage of being able to 
call into their service a trained force of civil engineers. Many of these 
engineers were connected with well-organized scientific societies, or 
were generally experienced in the construction of public works, and 
wrre familiar with what had been done for years on the coal tramroads; 
men on whose judgment the wealthy capitalist was willing to supply the 
money for the proposed improvement. England also had numerous 
machine shops fairly well equipped with tools and stationary engines, 
and many coal mines and iron foundries in operation, which made it 
possible to obtain without difficulty the material for laying the tracks 
with heavy rails firmly attached by strong chairs to the sleepers that 
were imbedded in stone ballast. 

With the exception of making the rail heavier, and using steel instead 
of iron, and substituting an iron for the wooden cross-tie, and strengthen- 
ing the splice chair, there has been no great change in the English 
system of track laying in the last fifty years. 

Many of the civil engineers who were first called into the service of 
the American railroads were connected with the Army Engineer Corps, 
having obtained their training at West Point, the only institution in 
the United States where engineering was taught during the first quar- 
ter of the century. In many cases these officers were detailed for a term 
of years to the "Board of Engineers for Internal Improvements"* to 
make surveys for various projected roads and canals. The preliminary 
surveys for the Camden and Amboy, the Pennsylvania, and the Balti- 
more and Ohio Railroads were made with the assistance of officers of 
this Corps. 

In some cases, however, these surveys were made by canal or road 
engineers who had obtained experience in canal and turnpike construc- 
tion. On the railroads then built the curves and gradients were fre- 
quently sharp and steep, as few cuts or fills were made, and these cheap 
roads were quickly extended, through a rapidly growing country, with 
a view to connect the navigable water courses, and to unite with the 
st cam-boat companies in forming " through lines." By the aid of these 
roads the Western and Southern States rapidly increased in population 
and commercial prosperity. In 1S3U the South Carolina Railroad from 
Charleston to Hamburg, 135 miles long, which was then the longest 
railroad in the world, was a continuous trestle work, with rails of 
squared timber, capped with strap iron, framed to the top of posts, 
where grading would have been necessary. 

*The Board of Engineers for Internal Improvements received their instructions 

directly from the. President of t lie United States, 1W24-':!-'.

AMERICA WITHOUT ROLLING MILLS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 

RAILROAD ERA. 

When the corner-stone of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was laid 
in 1828, there was not a rolling mill in all the United State where rails 
of the character laid on the Stockton and Darlington Railroad could be 
rolled ; in fact, the only rails rolled in America for several years after 
was the strap rail of merchantable bar iron 2i inches wide and five- 
eighths of an inch thick, the holes for the spikes often being drilled by 
hand.

stringers were chamfered. (See Fig. 37.)

Roads, such as the Camden and Am boy in New Jersey, Boston and 
Providence, Philadelphia and Germantown, and the Pennsylvania (then 
under State control), which did not adopt this construction, were com- 
pelled to obtain their edge rails and rail fastenings from England. 

The following memorial presented to the Twentieth Congress (H. R. 
Doc. No. 200) b} r the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, and re- 
ferred to the Committee on Roads and Canals March 17, 1828, is of the 
greatest interest in this connection. 



To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled: 

The memorial of the president and directors of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 
Company respectfully she weth: That your memorialists have it in contemplation, 
and are at this time taking measures, to construct a railroad, with at least two sets 
of tracks, from the city of Baltimore to the Ohio River, which will, it is estimated, 
unavoidably require not less than fifteen thousand tons of malleable iron. 

Your memorialists, taking into consideration the actual quantity of this indispen- 
sable article now annually manufactured in our own country, and further consider- 
ing Hie numerous lines of railroads already projected in different parts of the United 
Slates, arc continued in the opinion that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to pro- 
cure amongst ourselves a sufficient quantity for these numerous undertakings, and. 
consequently, that an enormous enhancement of the present price must be the inev- 
itable consequence unless supplies to a considerable extent be drawn from abroad ; 
which enhancement of an article so necessary both in the manufacturing and agri- 
cultural operations of the country would manifestly be injurious to both these im- 
portant, interests. 

Your memorialists are persuaded that so enlightened a body as the Representa- 
tives of the people of the United States are fully aware of the vast importance of the 
undertaking in which this company have embarked. It is indeed an enterprise in 



666 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889 

■which every section of our country has a deep and vital interest. Its direct effect 
upon the prosperity of the uatiou, if successfully accomplished, and its beneficial 
influence in perpetuating the happy union of these States, is perceived and appre- 
ciated by all ; at the same time it should not be overlooked that this great work, of 
such deep national concernment, and pregnant with such important consequences, 
has been undertaken, and so far conducted, by individual enterprise, and is still 
almost exclusively dependent upon private resources for its accomplishment. 

Under these considerations your memorialists take leave respectfully to ask of the 
National Legislature for the passage of an act authorizing the Baltimore and Ohio 
Railroad Company to import from abroad, if it should be found needful, such sup- 
plies of iron and iron machinery as may be requisite for the construction of the pro- 
posed road, free of duty. 

In presenting these views of au object essentially national to the representatives 
of their country, your memorialists rely on the w r isdom and patriotism of Congress to 
afford such relief as may be deemed proper, either by an exemption from duty or by 
a drawback upon the material actually used iu the construction of the road; at the 
same time they confidently believe that in granting the indulgence now asked for 
the best interests of the nation will be substantially promoted, whilst no injury what- 
ever will accrue either to the manufacturing, agricultural, or other important inter- 
ests of the country. 

Signed on behalf of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. 

P. E. Thomas. 

President. 

The half century from 1825 to 1875 may be called the experimental 
era of the American railroad, since the experience obtained during' that 
time has finally led to the adoption throughout the whole country of 
an almost uniform standard of track construction, depending upon the 
traffic. To trace the changes in form and the development of the 
modern American rail during this period is of the greatest interest. 



THE FIRST RATL ROLLED WITH A EASE. 

From au examination of the minutes of the board of directors of the 
Camden and Amboy Railroad, September, 1830, I find that in the in- 
structions given to Robert L. Stevens, president and chief engineer of 
that company, who had been ordered to visit England to inspect and 
report upon railroad matters there, he was directed to purchase " all 
iron rail," which the management of that company preferred to the 
wooden rail plated with strap iron. 

Mr. Stevens sailed a few days later, and it was during this voyage 
that he designed the first rail ever rolled with a base, whittling several 
model sections out of wood, which he obtained from the ship's carpenter. 

He was familiar with the Birkenshaw rail, with which the best En- 
glish roads were then being laid, but he saw that, as it required an 
expensive chair to hold it in place, it was not adapted to our country, 
where metal workers were scarce and iron was dear. He added the 
base to the T rail, dispensing with the chair. He also designed the 
"hook headed" spike, which is substantially the railroad spike of to- 
day, and the "iron tongue," which has been developed into the fish-

bar, and the rivets, which have been replaced by the bolt and nut, to 
complete the joint. 

A facsimile of the letter which lie addressed to the English iron mas- 
ters a short time after his arrival in London was published in the Ke- 
port on the Section of Transportation, 1887 (page 79). It contains a 
cross section, side elevation, and ground plan of the rail for which he 
requested bids. The letter reads: 

Liverpool, November 26, 1830. 

Gentlemen : At what rate will you contract to deliver at Liverpool, say from 500 
to 600 tons of railway, of the best quality iron rolled to the above pattern in 12 or 16 
feet lengths, to lap as showu in the drawing, with one hole at each end, and the pro- 
jections on the lower flange at every 2 feet, cash on delivery? 

How soon could you make the first delivery, and at what rate per month until the 
whole is complete .' Should the terms suit and the work give satisfaction a more ex- 
truded order is likely to follow, as this is but about one-sixth part of the quantity 
required. Please to address your answer (as soon as convenient) to the care of 
Francis B. Ogden, consul of the United States at Liverpool. 
I am, your obedient servant, 

Robert L. Stevens, 
President and Engineer of the Camden and South Amboy 

Railroad and Transportation Company. 

The base of the rail which he first proposed was to be wider where it 
was to be attached to supports than in the intervening spaces. This 
was afterwards modified, so that the base was made one width, 3 inches, 
throughout. Mr. Stevens received no favorable answer to his propo- 
sals, but being acquainted with Mr. Guest (afterwards Sir John Guest), 
then a member of Parliament aud proprietor of large iron works in 
Dowlais, Wales, he prevailed upon him to have the rails rolled at his 
works. Mr. Guest became interested in the scheme and accompanied 
Mr. Stevens to Wales, where the latter gave his personal supervision 
to the construction of the rolls. After the rolls were completed the 
Messrs Guest hesitated to have them used, through fear of damage to 
the mill machinery, upon hearing which Mr. Stevens deposited a hand- 
some sum guaranteeing the expense of repairing the mill in case it was 
damaged. The receipt for this deposit was preserved for many years 
among the archives of the Camden and Amboy company. As a matter 
of fact, the rolling apparatus did break down several times. "At first," 
as Mr. Stevens in a letter to his father, which T have seen, described it, 
"the rails came from the rolls twisted and as crooked as snakes," and 
he was greatly discouraged. At last the mill men acquired the art of 
straightening the rail while it cooled. The first shipment, consisting 
of 550 bars, 18 feet long, 36 pounds to the yard, arrived in Philadelphia 
on the ship Charlemagne May 10, 1831. The weight of the next ship- 
ment, several months afterwards, was increased to 12 pounds per yard,

the rail being 'M inches high. Over 30 miles of this rail was immedi- 
ately laid down. For sections of rail as designed and rolled see Fig. 
39. *

(From original r.i the U. S. National Museum. ) 

This rail was fastened to stone blocks with hook-headed spikes; at 
the joints were iron tongues fasteued to the stem of the rail by rivets 
put on hot. This was the standard rail of the Camden and Amboy 
Railroad, 1831 -'40. 

From a letter written by Francis B. Stevens to James M. Swank, esq., 
special agent of statistics, dated Hoboken, New Jersey, March, 188^, 
the following extracts are taken : 

I have always believed that Robert L. Stevens was the inventor of what is called 
the T-rail, and also of the method of fastening it by spikes, and I have never known 
his right to the invention questioned. 

Mr. Stevens's invention consisted in adding the broad flange on the bottom, with 
base sufficient to carry the load, and shaped so that it conld be secured to the wood 
below it by spikes with hooked heads, thus dispensing with the cast-iron chair, and 
making the rail and its fastening such as it now is in common use. 

In the year 183G, and frequently afterwards, he spoke to mo about his invention of 
this rail. The Camden and Arnboy road laid with this rail was opened October 9, 
1832, two years after the opening of the Manchester and Liverpool Railroad. Of this 
I was a witness. This rail, long known as the old Camden and Amboy rail, differed 
but little, either in shape or'proportions, from the T-rail now in common use, but 
weighed only 36 pounds to the yard. For the next six or eight years after the open- 
ing of the Camden and Amboy Railroad it was little used here or abroad, nearly all 
the roads built in the United States using the Hat iron bar, about 2| by £ inches, 
nailed to wooden rails, the English continuing to use the chair and wedges. 

My uncle always regretted that he had not patented his invention. He mentioned 
to me upward of forty years ago that when advised by his friend, Mr. F. B. Ogden, 
the American consul at Liverpool, who was familiar with the circumstances of his 
invention, to patent it, he found that it was too late, and that his invention had 
become public property. 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN RAIL AND TRACK. 



669 



A few years after,* on much of the Stevens rail laid on the Camden 
and Amboy Railroad, the rivets at the joints were discarded and the 
bolt with the screw thread and nut, similar to that now used, was 
adopted as the standard. (See Fig. -10.)

670 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The Stevens rail did not come into general use for several years, the 
next road to adopt it being the Boston and Providence, about 1840. 

On the Boston and Lowell Railroad, Massachusetts, the fish-bellied 
rail was laid in chairs on stone blocks. As late as 1847 the Hudson 
River road used the Stevens rail, supported by chairs, but these were 
soon afterwards discarded. 

THE FIRST AMERICAN TRACK. 

Mr. Francis B. Stevens also informs me that in 1835 he was employed 
by the Camden and Amboy company to make a profile of the road bed 
from South Amboy to Bordentown. At that time there were many 
places (the longest being a piece 2 miles long, from the wharf at Amboy 
to Deep Cut) where the Stevens rail was spiked to the cross-tie accord- 
ing to the present practice. This method was at first resorted to as a 
temporary expedient, on account of the delay in getting stone blocks 
from Sing Sing. In the meantime it was found that the wood ties were 
more satisfactory, and in a year or two all the stone blocks were re- 
placed by wood ties. Without doubt the Camden and Amboy was the 
first railroad in the world to be laid according to the present American 
practice. 

On other roads the wooden tie was afterwards laid on account of the 
high price of stone blocks and stone stringers, the use of which was 
originally contemplated. 

Speaking of the engineering practice in this era, the late Ashbel 
Welch said in his presidential address to the American Society of Civil 
Engineers: 

American engineers have often shown that pocerty is the mother of invention. 
For example, they used wooden cross-ties as a temporary substitute, being too poor 
to buy stone blocks, and so made good roads because they were not rich enough lo 
make bad ones. 

CAST-IRON RAILS MADE IN AMERICA. 

In Johnson's u Notes on the Use of Anthracite," he described tests of 
cast-iron rails made during 1841 at Lyman's foundry, near Pottsville, 
Pennsylvania. These rails were designed for colliery railways. They 
were only 6 feet long. For 3 or 4 inches at each end the rail had a sec- 
tion similar to the Stevens rail; for the remaining 5^ feet the rail was 
somewhat similar to the English bull-headed rail. 

Previous to the year 1842, when Congress passed the celebrated high 
tariff law, all imported iron rails were admitted to the country almost 
free of duty. The tariff on manufactured iron, agreed upon by that 
Congress, increased the cost of English rails so much that the railways 
were forced to seriously advocate the erection of American rolling mills 
for the special purpose of making rails.

RAILS FIRST ROLLED IN AMERICA. 

The first rail mill erected in this country was located at Mount Sav- 
age, Allegheny County, Maryland. The first rail was rolled in the 
summer of 1844. In honor of that event the Franklin Institute of 
Philadelphia awarded a medal to the proprietors in October, 1814. 

The rail was of the XZL form, similar to the Evans (British) patent, 
and the first few hundred tons manufactured were laid on the Balti- 
tiinore and Ohio Eailroad, between Mount Savage and Cumberland.

Every American road, however, without exception, replaced the 
Trail and strap rail, by rail of the Stevens pattern, as rapidly as their 
financial condition permitted, continuing to import all rails from Eng- 
land until L845. 

THE STEVENS RAIL FIRST ROLLED IN AMERICA, 1845. 

In the History of Iron of all Ages Swank states (p. 344) : 

The Montour Rolling Mill, at Danville, Pennsylvania, was built in 1845 expressly 
to roll rails, and here were rolled in October of that year the first T-rails* made in 
the United States, and that the firet T-rail rolls in this country were made for the 
Montour Iron Company by Haywood & Snyder, proprietors of the Colliery Iron 
Works at Pottsville, the work being done at their branch establishment at Dan- 
ville, Pennsylvania, 1846. 

Among other early rail mills were the following, with the date when 

"As the form of the English T-rail was dispensed with in America, rails of the Ste- 
vens pattern (called H-rail in 1832) have been known as T-rails tor many years.

they began to roll rails : Boston Iron Works, May 6, 1846 ; Trenton Iron 
Works, Cooper & Hewitt, proprietors, Jane, 1846; New England Iron 
Company, Providence, Rhode Island, September 1, 1816; Phoenix Iron 
Company, Phcenixville, Pennsylvania, November, 1816. 

The rapidity with which American capital was diverted in this di- 
rection, has for the last forty years been one of the great arguments 
used by the advocates of a high tariff for the protection of American 
industries. 

During the year 1848 a very interesting experiment was tried by the 
Camden and Amboy Railroad. Arrangements were made with Cooper 
& Hewitt, at the Trenton Iron Works, to roll a 92 pound rail, 7 inches 
high, with a base 4| inches wide; 15 miles of the Camden and Amboy 
road were laid with this rail the following year. The engineer of that 
company believed that he had at last solved the problem of track con- 
struction, inasmuch as this rail gave an admirable opportunity for a 
strong joint. By experience it was found that this rail was too rigid, 
and produced so much concussion by the train that the ends soon ham- 
mered out, and where the ballasting was imperfect great damage was 
caused to the rolling stock; consequently the rail was soon after takeu 
up. Much of this old rail found its way to the cities, where it was 
bought by architects and contractors for building purposes.* 

The fact that this rail was rolled successfully resulted in the intro- 
duction of the "I" beam for architectural purposes, Cooper & Hewitt 
having done a large business at the New Jersey Iron Works, at Tren- 
ton, in this line ever since that time. Fig. 47 is drawn from a section

of this rail in the collection. It was laid between Bordentown and 
Burlington in 1840. 



"Among other places, many of these rails were used for beams in the United States 
Mint at Philadelphia.

PEAR-SHAPED RAILS. 

The early American Trails were made of inferior iron, and this was 
one of the causes that led to the adoption of the section with a pear- 
shaped head, with which many roads were laid during - the next fifteen 
or twenty years. 

Sections of four of the pear-shaped rails described in the report of the 
railroad commission of the State of New York for 1845 are in the col- 
lection. 

Cross-sections of these rails are shown.

six pounds to the yard. In use in 1855.

The obtuse angle between the lower side of the head and the stem of 
the rail made it difficult to apply a splice bar of any kind to advantage, 
and this fact led to the introduction of the ring joint (see Fig. 120) (one 
iron ring passing through two slots, one in each stem of adjacent rails 
and passing around under the base of the rail and held in position by 
a wedge driven between the ring and the rail stem). Chairs and other 
joint fixtures attached entirely to the base of the rail were also experi-

men ted with, but generally without satisfaction, judging from the fact 
that none have survived. 

The difficulty in making good joints with the pear-headed rail was 
overcome, by some of the engineers, by planing away a portion of the 
head of the rail for a foot or 18 inches from each end. In Fig. 52 is

shown a section of the pear-headed rail, fitted for splice bar, used on 
the Erie Railroad. On this rail a cast-iron angle splice, containing four 
bolts and measuring 9 inches in length, was used as early as 1857. 

On the Pennsylvania Railroad and on the Belvidere-Delaware Rail- 
road, as will be seen in Fig. 53, the rails in some cases were planed with

DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN RAIL AND TRACK.

Full-size models of these rails are in the collection. 

When the track composed of this type of compound rails was new, it 
is described by those who rode upon it as being the finest track of 
the period. No satisfactory nut lock was in use at that time, and as 
the screw-threads or rivets wore and traffic became heavier, the differ- 
ent parts of the rails could only be kept together by constant attention, 
in screwing up the nuts or putting in new rivets. As the rails laid 
were of iron, the wear of the inner surface was considerable, so that in 
a little while the track was badly damaged and the old solid rail was 
substituted.

(Fron in the i\ S. National Museum.] 

It is still an unsolved question whether or not, with some improve- 
ment in the section, and made of steel and held together with the im- 
proved bolt and nut-lock, the compound rail may be the rail of the 
future. 

POOR RAILS LAID DURING WAR TIMES. 

During the next ten years little seems to have been done by American 
railroad contractors to improve the shape of the rail or joint fixtures; 
in fact, during the civil war, iron was so dear that very little rail was 
rolled. Few new railroads were built and repairs to tracks were only 
made under the gravest necessity. Almost all the forms of rails which 
were made during these few years were designed by the proprietors of 
rail mills, who naturally adopted such shapes as were easy for them to 
make, and the railroads, when further delay was dangerous, went into 
the market and purchased such as were offered at the lowest price, 
without regard to the shape of the rail, the quality of the iron, or 
whether it was designed for light or heavy traffic. 



G80 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



THE ASHBEL WELCH 1JA1L. 

After the close of the war in 1865, it became necessary to relay a 
large percentage of the mileage of almost every railroad. Upon many 
of the roads some rails were in use with which the roads were originally 
laid. The late Ashbel Welch, in "A Memoir on Rails," read before the 
American Society of Civil Engineers, June 10, 1874, states that "during 
the year 1865 the task presented itself to me of devising or selecting 
suitable forms of rails for the system of railroads occupying the central 
part of the State of New Jersey between Philadelphia and New York, 
of which I was the executive officer as well as engineer. 

The 62-pound Ashbel Welch rail, which was rolled by the Bethlehem 
Iron Company during the following year, was 4£ inches high, the base 
being 4 inches and the stem one-half an inch thick; the angle of incli- 
nation of bearing surfaces both on the top of the base and bottom of tbe 
head being 14 degrees. 

Figs. 62 and 63 are from original sections of the Welch 50-pound and 
62-pound rail in the collection. Substantially this form of rail was

( From original sections in theU. S National Museum.) 

adopted by the railroads in the Eastern and Middle States previous to 
the year 1873, although when the rails were first laid the cross-section 
was strongly objected to. 

Mr. Welch's labors in this direction led to his being considered one 
of the foremost rail designers in America, and in 1873 he was appointed 
chairman of a committee by the American Society of Civil Engineers 
to report on the " form, weight, manufacture, and life of rails," the 
other members being M. 1ST. Forney, O. Chanute, and I. M. St. John. 
The report of that committee, presented at the annual convention, 
June, 1874, was the most exhaustive treatise on the subject of rails 
published up to that time. 

In Mr. Welch's memoir attached to that report, in alluding to his 
pattern of 1865, he states : " I made one decided mistake in this pattern 
by not having the outer bottom corners of the head sharp enough, or 
rather I yielded too much to the feeling against snch an unsightly

thing as an angle head." The rail proposed by Mr. Ohanute in the 
same report is not dissimilar to the section of standard 66-pound rail 
now in use on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy and several other 
railroads. Fig. (51 is from a drawing in the collection.

English engineers had, in the mean time, given considerable attention 
to the jQ_ rail (or ; 'box rail," as it is sometimes called) both in England 
and in Canada. 

Imported XI rails were laid as early as September, 1835, on the 
Wilmington and Susquehanna .Railroad. In 1845 a modification of the 
XI rail was laid on the Drogheda Railway in Ireland — the rail being 
compressed inwardly at the bottom until the inside comers were made 
to touch. In America a small quantity of a similar rail was manufac- 
tured at the Mount Savage rolling mill, called "hollovv rail." This 
was done by heating the rail after it had been rolled to size and passing- 
it through a set of rods designed for the purpose.* 

A cross-section of this form of rail in use on the Great Western Rail- 
way of England is shown in Fig. 65, while in Fig. 60 a cross-section

The XX rail was in use in several of our Southern States during the 
war of 1861-'C5. 

It was found that the _Q_ rail was almost certain to fail when laid 
on cross-ties, and for this reason roads, notably the Nashville and Chat- 
tanooga, that used it always favored the superstructure with the rail 
bearing on a longitudinal stringer instead of a cross-tie.

The rail was laid in broken stone with tie bars 10 feet apart. Nine 
hundred miles of this type of rail were laid in England prior to 1858, a 
mile or two also were laid on the Reading Railroad in the United States. 
"Between 5 and 6 miles of this rail, closely riveted together, were laid 
in England in 1850 and were iu use for several years without experi- 
encing any difficulty from expansion."*

collection. As no splice bars save a thin plate to protect the wood at 
the end of the rail were used, this rail was expected to become popular, 
but its use was abandoned a few years afterwards. 

Previous to 1850 English rails were usually rolled in lengths of 15, 1(5, 
and 18 feet; by 1855 the latter length became the universal standard. 

As improved methods were adopted in irou manufacture, the length 
was increased in order to reduce the number of joints.* By 1857 rails 
were made at progressive mills 21 to 24 and 27 feet long and by 1860-'65 
the 30-foot limit was reached. 

Although longer lengths have been manufactured at a few mills, the 
30-foot rail has been considered the standard for over a quarter of a 
century. 

STEEL RAILS. 

The first steel rails in Europe are said to have been rolled at the 
Ebbw Vale Works, in Wales, about 1855. The steel was produced by 
the Uchaturis process. Zerah Colburn states that "the quality of the 
steel is said to be equal to that used for razors." 

The difficulty in obtaining good iron on this side of the water led the 
more prosperous American companies to continue to import steel and 
iron rails from abroad for some years. 

Fig. 69 is a cross-section of the steel rails rolled at Dowlais, Wales, 
for the New Orleans, Memphis and Chattanooga Railroad in I860, from 
a drawing in the collection.

STEEL RAILS ROLLED IN AMERICA. 

The introduction of Bessemer steel in America and the conflicts in 
the United States Patent Office, which finally resulted in a compromise 
and consolidation of the various interests involved, form a very inter- 
esting chapter in the history of American manufacture. 

In Swank's " History of Iron in all Ages" I find that "the first steel 
rails ever made in this country were rolled at the North Chicago Boil- 
ing Mills in May, 18G5." These were experimental rails, only a few 

In IS4U it was not uncommon to find eight hundred joints in a mile of single 
track. Now, 1890, the number is reduced to about three hundred and fifty. 



684 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, L889. 



being rolled in the presence of a committee of the American Iron and 
Steel Association. 

The first steel rails ever rolled in the United States upon order in the 
way of regular business were rolled by the Cambria Iron Company, at 
Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in August, 1867. In no one year during the 
next five years were more thau 40,000 tons of Bessemer steel rails man- 
ufactured in the United States. 

About 1870-73 attempts were made by several rail manufactures to 
roll rails that should have a steel head andiron web and flange — "steel 
top rail," it was called. A considerable quantity of this rail was rolled 
by the Trenton Iron Company for the New Jersey division of the Penn- 
sylvania Railroad Company. While this experiment was reasonably 
successful the lessened cost of making steel, soon afterwards made it 
practicable to make the whole rail of steel. 

The production of steel rails, which aggregated 90,000 tons in 1872, 
increased from year to year, so that in 1882, ten years later, the output 
reached nearly 1,500,000 tons, the price falling from $140 to $35, or 
one-quarter the cost of ten years before. 

During the last ten or twelve years no radical change has been made 
in the shape of the section of rails laid by first-class railroads. It is 
true that the constantly increasing weight of the locomotive and of the 
lading of the freight cars has made it necessary to use heavier rails — 
the increased metal beiug put in the head, where the traffic is heavy, 
or in the base (the base of some standard sections beiug made as wide 
as 5 or 5£ inches), where the cross-ties upon which the rail is laid are 
of soft wood. The general shape of the rail has, however, been but 
slightly changed. 

Sections of the standard rails laid by the Pennsylvania Railroad 
Company are shown in Figs. 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, and by the Chicago, 
Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company* in Figs. 70, 77 78 79.

THE STEVENS RAIL IN EUROPE. 

About 1837 a rail with a base similar to the Stevens rail was designed 
by Charles Blacker Viguoles, an English railway engineer, and the 
names "Vignoles's rail" and "contractor's rail" have been applied to 
the various modifications of the Stevens rail, both in England and on 
the continent, since that time. 

A section of the Stevens rail, 4i inches high, with a base 6 inches 
wide, in use on the Great Western Railway of England in 1858, is 
shown in Fig. 87, which is made from a drawing in the collection. This

rail was made with a wide base in order that it should have sufficient 
bearing on the stringer, to which it was attached by screw bolts. The 
Great Western was a broad-gauge railroad, the gauge being 7 feet.

that the wear of the rail iu the chairs made the lower surface rough, 
tlii.s practice was abandoned, and a larger portion of the metal has since

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 
STRINGERS AND TIES OF AVOOD. 



The high price of iron led the engineers of many early roads, built 
upon a small capitalization to design a superstructure composed mainly 
of wood, as little iron as possible being used. The wooden rail, capped 
with strap-iron, previously alluded to, was attached to longitudinal 
stringers, and these were kept ' ; in line " by cross timbers 4, 5, and some- 
times 6 feet apart. 

On roads laid with English T-rails in chairs, or with the Stevens rail 
spiked to the support, the necessity for a longitudinal support for the 
rail did not exist, and the stringer being dispensed with, it became nec- 
essary to put the cross-ties closer together. 

Ties have been used from time to time of various widths, lengths, 
and thicknesses, split, sawed, and hewn, as illustrated in Figs. 9G, 97, 
and 98. 




Fig. 96. 
Cross-tie— Split quarter Log. 




Fig. 97. 
Cross-tie— Split half Lou. 



The specifications for cross-ties now require that they be hewn on 
both sides, as shown in Fig. 98, and that they be cut to exact lengths, 
96 or 102 inches.

METAL TIES. 



The extensive use of metal ties in foreign countries has led a few 
American managers to put down a limited number of experimental iron 
ties on their roads. About two thousand iron ties of the standard 
adopted by the London and Northwestern Railway of England, were

the collection. It is the opinion of the chief engineer of the Pennsyl- 
vania Railroad that the iron tie will not be extensively used in America 
as long as white-oak standard cross-ties can be purchased for $1 or less.t 
An exhaustive report upon the iron cross-ties used by European rail- 
ways, compiled by Russel E. E. Tralman, of the Engineering News, will

estry, in Bulletin No. 3 of the U. S. Agricultural Department.

is attached to the cross-tie by bolts and nuts, instead of by rivets as 
in the former system. The ends of the ties on the outer sides of the 
double tracks are generally depressed as shown. Between the tracks 
the ends are left open, so that the ballast may be properly tamped.

JOINT FIXTURES. 

Failure of the rail at the joint has from the beginning of railway con- 
struction directed thought towards the invention of the ideal fixture 
"as strong at the joint as at any part of the rail," an ideal which, after 
sixty years of experiment, has not yet been attained.

The wooden pin shown secured the chair to a short wooden pile driven 
into the ground. The rails were 4 feet long. The joint fixtures in the 
tracks laid with various types of T- rails* were chairs slightly longer 
than those in the quarters and middle of the rail, and the ends of the 
rail were held in place by wedges, as shown in Figs. 113 and 113a. The

age Railroad in Pennsylvania, 1832, with rail and chair complete, which 
is in the collection. The rails, chairs, and joint fixtures for that rail- 
road were manufactured in England in 1830. 

THE BEGINNINGS OF THE SPLICE BAR. 

The splice-bar or fish-plate was of necessity an American iuvention, 
since the Camden and Amboy Railroad, which was the first iron railway 
laid without chairs, found it necessary to use it. In Robert L. Stevens's 
original specifications, each rail was to have a projection on the stem at 
one end, which was intended to be riveted to the stem of the adjoining 
rail. Owing to impracticability of manufacture this plan was never

carried out, and joint tongues (an illustration of which is to be found 
in the Report U. S. National Museum for 1S86, Figs. 1 and 2, Plate II, 
opposite page 122) were used. These iron tongues were attached to the 
stems of the rail with hot rivets. Fig. 114 is from a drawing made from

an original stone block, rails, and joint fixtures, which wore laid on the 
Camden and Amboy Railroad in L830 and taken out of the track when 
the road was relaid with cross-ties a few years later.* 

As will be seen by reference to Fig. 40 1 the Camden and Amboy Kail- 
road Company used the fish plate with screw-bolt and nut previous to 
1837. Tins practice does not appear to have been pursued in Eu gland 
until ten years later. It is stated that " the fish joint (with bolts 
through the stem of the rail) was designed by W. Bridges Adams, 
1847, and has been applied throughout the London and Northwestern 
Kail way ."J 

Boiled fish-plates 18 inches in length came into general use about 
1850-55. In 1858 those on the North Loudon Railway of England were 
27 iuches long. Figs. 115, 11G, and 117 are from drawings of the rails

WOODEN BLOCK JOINTS. 

The cost of the iron joint fixtures led to experiments with wood 
blocks as early as 1840. Many roads that had used nothing but spikes 
and iron tie plates at the joints, added materially to the strength of 
these joints by drilling the stem of the rail, and bolting a block of 
wood of the proper shape to the outer side of the rail. About 1860, 
some of the Eastern roads adopted a standard joint fixture composed 
of a wooden block 48 inches long for the outside of the rail and a short 
iron splice bar to fit closely against the stem on the inside. Fig. 119 is

drawn from a set of the original joint fixtures that had been in the 
tracks of the present New York Division of the Pennsylvania Rail- 
road for many years.* Many of these blocks were used with steel rails 
and made excellent track, when kept in proper repair. 

SLOT RAIL AND RING JOINT. 

About 1850, on some parts of the Camden and Amboyand West Jer- 
sey Railroads, the ring joint was used. A slot about 2 inches long was 
cut in the stem of each rail at both ends ; into these slots a ring was

slipped which encircled the base, to which it was secured by a wedge 
driven on each side of the stein between the ring and the base of the 
rail.

of the West Jersey Railroad for many years.*

About 1850, G. Samuels patented the method of scarfing the rail- 
heads and bending the ends of the rail so that the stems could be 
riveted together in the same way that boiler plates are put together, 
but this invention was not put into practice. 



THE ANGLE SPLICE BAR. 

As early as 1857 the angle splice bar (or cast-iron bracket joint, as it 
was then called) was tried on the Erie Railroad. The form of this splice- 
bar has been already illustrated in Fig. 52. It was abandoned after 
a short trial. 

The wrought-irou angle splice-bar, somewhat similar in section to the 
Adams cast bracket joint, seems to have come into use about 1868.

Dear Sir: Regarding your request for standard rails in use on the Chicago, Bur- 
lington and Quincy in 1870, 1880, and 1890,1 take the liberty of going farther hack 
than the dates you mention, in order to illustrate more Cully the development of track, 
andshow, if possible, what the tendency lias been. 

When the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad was first organized in 1854,

702 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

with 58 miles of railroad, the track was laid with compound or continuous iron rail 
riveted together. I have not a drawing of this rail, hut you are doubtless familiar with 
the design. The rail was rudely similar to the present "J" rail divided in half vertically 
through the weh, and these two halves riveted together broken jointed, so that the 
end of one half rail did not come at the end of auother half rail. This made an 
excellent track for the time heing, as the reports show, and indeed it was a very ex- 
pensive track, for the rail weighed some 72 pouuds per yard and cost some $70 to $75 
per ton. This compouud rail, however, soon began to show its defects, which I need 
hardly explain here, and some two years later, when the Chicago, Burlington and 
Quiucy by consolidation with the Central Military Tract Railroad became an im- 
portant road with 138 miles of track, the X ra *il was adopted as standard and laid 
with cast-iron chairs at the joints. Wrought-iron chairs I find were also used to a 
limited extent at this time. 

In 1862 the construction of the road from Aurora to Chicago, a distance of 35 miles, 
was beguu, and for this purpose 3,500 tons of "the best quality iron rail were pur- 
chased of the Cambria Iron Company, of Pennsylvania, at a price of $65 per ton 
delivered at Chicago." 

The chief engineer, in his report for that year, says that the compound rail was 
being removed from track as rapidly as possible, and being replaced with new and 
rerolled iron T rails of the ordinary pattern. These T rails had a maximum length 
of 21 feet. 

In 18G4 the general use of fish-plates, a flat piece of iron fitting close to the web of 
the rail between the head and the base, was. adopted. The chief engineer in his 
report for that year says "the fish-joint splices make a smoother track, less liable 
to get out of repair, and cost less than the ordinary rubber chair." This allusion to 
the "rubber chair" rather puzzles me. I do not understand whether a piece of rubber 
was introduced into the bottom of the ordinary cast-iron chair to obviate the trouble 
from noise and stop the rattling, or not; but I presume that this was the case. At 
this time quite a large proportion of the rail laid in each year was rerolled iron rail, 
and I find that the cost of rerolliug amounted to over $35 per ton at Chicago, and a 
good deal moie than that in 1865 and 1866, on account of the high prices for labor 
and material following the war period. 

In the summer of 1867, 3 miles of experimental steel rails were laid in different 
places in Illinois where they would receive very severe service. I can not learn the 
exact section or weight per yard of this rail ; but, from what I can learn, I imagine 
that the rail weighed between 56 and 60 pouuds per yard, and was very similar in 
design to tbe old 60-pouud rail, shown in print No. 1, which I send you. This rail 
was laid with fish-plates similar to the then recent practice with iron rails, and as 
in the case of iron rails, it was laid with "supported" or " on-tie" joints, the ends 
of the rails being notched to admit of spiking at that point and prevent the rail from 
creeping. The first experience with this rail was not altogether favorable. Of 3 
miles of track laid, seven rails broke in the first year; in each case, however, the 
chief engineer tells us, where the holes in the splice bars had been punched instead 
of drilled. In the next two years, however, there were no breakages and in 1870 it 
was decided to adopt steel as standard for main track renewals or new construction. 
During the year 72 miles of steel rails were laid, which with the 6 miles already in 
track made 78 miles of steel rail out of 302 miles then in operation. The road then 
consisted of a line from Chicago to East Burlington aud from Galeshurg to Quincy. 
The steel rail then used was substantially the rail shown in blue print No. 1, which 
I send you, with a plain fish-plate and not the angle-bar, which was adopted in later 
years. 

In 1875 or 1876 an angle-bar was adopted for this rail, and this was slightly modi- 
fied in 1879. This provided for a "supported " or " on-tie" joint. The only difficulty 
with it was that the slot near the center of the angle bar was frequent cause for 
breakage at that point. In 1879, therefore, the 66-pound rail for a suspended joint 
was designed and made the standard. 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN RAIL AND TRACK. 703 

In 1880 the length of the road iu operation was 2,653 miles in Illinois, Iowa, and 
Nebraska. Of this mileage, 1,100 miles were steel rails. 

When the 60-ponnd rail was discarded as a standard in 1879, two sections of steel 
rail were adopted of a substantially similar design and weighing 50 and 66 pounds 
per yard, respectively, for lines of light and heavy traffic. The joint used on the 66- 
pound rail is already mentioned, and the joint on the 50- pound rail provides for a 
" supported " or " on-tie " joint, the idea being that with a stronger or heavier rail 
a suspended joint could be used, where it would not be a good thing for a weaker 
rail. Both these rails continued to be used almost up to the present date. During 
this period considerable dissatisfaction was found with the angle bar for the 56-pound 
rail, which, on account of its slot iu the center, frequentlybroke. To obviate this 
difficulty, without seriously adding to the cost of the rail, I lengthened the angle bar 
at one end for this rail and the old 60-pound rail 5A inches, thus allowing the slot at 
the joint to be omitted, and yet preserving the on-tie or supported joint. This was 
adopted as standard early in 1889. During this period also considerable dissatisfac- 
tion was found with the suspended joint on the 66-pound rail, and in the latter part 
of 1889 the angle bar was lengthened 6 inches, so as to allow a three- tie supported 
joint, the same cross-section of angle bar, however, being used. 

Quite recently, in the year of 1890, the old 66-pound section of rail has been super- 
seded by a new standard, namely, the Northern Pacific 66-pound rail, with the angle 
bar. The notable dirt'ereuce between this rail and the other 66-pouud rail lies in the 
fact that the distribution of metal in the different parts of the rail is more equal. 
The rail itself is stiller and higher, and the angle bar very much stiffer. These differ- 
ences have been made chieily by putting considera de less metal in the head of the 
rail, because we have found in practice that a very small portion of the head wears 
away, and that the rail is usually removed from track for other causes. 

You will note particularly what an advance has been made in perfecting the joint. 
After trying the suspended joint, we returned again to the supported joint, at thesame 
time making the angle bar much stiller, bringing the bolt-holes closer to the end, and 
using seven-eighths instead of three fourths bolts. 

In the mean time the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad is experimenting 
with a view of adopting for lines of the heaviest traffic a heavier rail. In 1888 two 
sections of 85-pound rail w T ere designed, and 7^ miles of each section were rolled and 
laid in track side by side in 1889. In 1890 a similar amount of each section has again 
been rolled and laid in track. It is impossible at present to determine which rail is 
likely to give the best satisfaction, but we hope before spring to get some light on the 
subject. Besides the test iu track which is being made of these two sections of 85- 
pound rail, quite elaborate tests of each section were made about a year ago at the 
United States Government Watertown Arsenal, the results of which I dare say you 
have seen. 

In the mean time, while we are debating what shall be the design and weight of 
our rail for the lines of the heaviest traffic, it is a Bottled fact that we shall not again 
buy for standard-gauge railroad any rail lighter than 06 pounds per yard. The 
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, owning and controlling as it does upwards of 7,000 
miles of railroad, always has large quantities of rail not sufficiently good for main track 
use, but which either with or without the sawing off of the ends is perfectly good 
for branch-line service, so thai our lines with very light traffic will usually be laid 
either with the light rail which was originally put there or with second-hand rail 
removed from main line. 

Hoping that I have given you the information you desired, I have the honor to re- 
main, yours, truly, 

Fred. A. Delano.

LETTER FROM THE BKTHLEHEM IRON COMPANY. 

South Bethlehem, Pa., June 30, 1890. 
Sir : The first rails rolled by us were iron rails, and owing to our early record books 
having become mislaid, we are at a loss as to what to send you to be of any use. We 
iuclose, however, under separate cover, a number of blue prints, that we trust you 
may be able to use to advantage. 

You will note that a great many of the sections on the blue prints are marked un- 
known. Records relating to these sections have been lost or mislaid. Where we 
were able to do so, the year the rail was rolled the section and name of the road using 
the rail has been noted on the blue prints. 

We also send you a blue print of a compound rail, which, however, we never at- 
tempted to make, the scheme not having originated with us. You will also find 
inclosed several sections designed by Mr. Robt. H. Sayre, with Sayre-Fritz splice 
plates.

Mr. Isaac Dripps, who in 1831 erected the locomotive John Bull at 
Bordentown, New Jersey (all of the parts of the engine having been 
made by Stephenson ct Co., New Castle on-Tyne, England), has furnished 
the information for Fig. 132, which illustrates the manner in which a

lection of frogs and switches in the near future, so that the history of 
the development of these two very important track-appliances may be 
preserved.

EXPLORATIONS IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR IN 1887, 
MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE CRUISE OF THE 

C. S, FISH COMMISSION' SCHOONER GRAMPUS* 



By Frederic A. Lucas, 
Assistant Curator of the Department of Comparative Anatomy. 



In tbe spring - of 1S87 the writer was detailed by Professor Baird to 
accompany tbe U. S. Fisb Commission schooner Grampus on a cruise 
to northeastern Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, primarily 
to obtain, if possible, bones of the Great Auk; secondarily to collect 
such other specimens as might be obtainable. Two years earlier Pro- 
fessor Baird had approved a proposed plan of visiting Funk Islaud, 
off Cape Freels, Newfoundland, a former breeding place of the Great 
Auk, in the hope of finding remains of that extinct bird, but the many 
difficulties in the way precluded carrying this plan into effect until the 
building of the Grampus and her projected trip made it feasible. From 
a scientific standpoint it was extremely desirable to secure bones of the 
Great Auk, since up to 1887 there were but nine skeletons of that species 
preserved in museums, only one being in the United States, while the 
U. S. National Museum possessed but a single bone. Even viewed 
commercially, a collection of Auk bones would be of considerable value, 
since the small number of existing specimens had caused them to bring 
a high price whenever brought into the market.! 

It was eminently fitting that a search for remains of the Great Auk 
should be undertaken in CDunection with fishery researches, since this 
bird once formed an important factor in the prosecution of the early 



* This report is supplementary to the paper by Mr. Lucas, entitled "Tbe Expedi- 
tion to Funk Islaud, with Observations upon tbe History aud Anatomy of tbe Great 
Auk," in tbe Report of tbe National Museum for 1888. It was at first intended for 
publication in tbe Report of tbe U. S. Fisb Commission. Certain statements con- 
cerning tbe Great Auk in Mr. Lucas's previous paper are repeated in this report, but 
it is believed that they arc essential in this connection for the proper understanding 
of the narrative. For fuller details concerning the Great Auk and its extinction, 
tbe reader is referred to the Report of the National Museum for 1888, and for detailed 
noteson the birds collected see report of William Palmer, in Proceedings U. S. National 
Museum, vol. XIII, pp. 249-2f>.~>. 

tin this connection it may be of interest to state that one of the skeletons col- 
lected by the Grampus expedition and exchanged for natural history specimens with 
a London dealer, was sold by him to the Museum of Science and Arts, Edinburgh, 
for £120, or about $G00.

710 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Newfoundland fisheries. The very earliest reference to the Great Auk 
in America occurs in the account of Cartier's first voyage, in 1534, 
wherein the chronicler records a visit to Funk Island for the purpose 
of procuring birds for fresh provisions, and, under the name of Great 
Apponatz, tells of the capture of a boat-load of this flightless fowl. 
From that time onward, so long as the species existed, fishermen and 
colonists availed themselves of tbe prodigious store of Great Auks 
which, after the manner of mankind, they assumed that Providence 
had provided for their special benefit. The extent to which the Great 
Auk was used is shown by Anthonie Parkhurst's statement, written in 
1578, that " the Frenchmen who fish neere the grand bale doe bring small 
store of flesh with them, but victuall themselves with these birds" (the 
Great Auks). Granting that this exaggerates the facts in the case, it 
seems evident that the birds were very largely employed for provisions, 
and since, in 1578, there were about one hundred and fifty French ves- 
sels, aggregating about 7,000 tons, employed in the cod fishery, the de- 
struction of Great Auks must have been immense. 

Captain Eichard Whitbourne, who was sent in 1615 to establish order 
in Newfoundland, on his return wrote a book, which was freely distrib- 
uted in order to encourage emigration to that country, and in this we 
find the abuudance of Great Auks held forth among other inducements. 
Says the narrator : "These Penguins* areas bigge as geese and flye 
not, for they have but a little short wing, and they multiply so infi- 
nitely upon a certain flat iland that men drive them from thence upon 
a board into their boats by hundreds at a time, as if God had made the 
innocency of so poore a creature to become such an admirable instru 
inent for the sustentation of man." 

In more recent times we are told that the merchants of Bonavista 
and otln r localities used to sell salted Auks by the hundred weight for 
provisions, and Audubon says that the young were used for bait, t 

Undoubtedly the drain made upon the numbers of the Great Auk 
for the purposes just mentioned wouM have ultimately caused its ex- 
termination, but the direct cause for its rapid extinction was the killing 
of the birds for the sake of the feathers. This destruction was ren- 
dered all the more rapid and profitable from the fact that the breeding 
grounds of the Great Auk, like those of the Gannet, were extremely 
restricted, so that during the breeding season the entire race was to be 
found assembled at two or three localities. Whatever may have been 
the case in prehistoric times, there are no allusions to the Great Auk in 
the accounts of early navigators that even hint at its occurrence in 

*The name Penguin was originally applied to the Great Auk, and not to the 
southern bird now hearing the appellation, and was the name by which the Great 
Auk was commonly known in America. 

t These two statements are taken from works on the Great Auk, and the authority 
for the first is not given. Still, there seems no room to doubt the truth of either. 
On the other hand, no reference occurs anywhere to the use of the eggs of the Auk, 
although they must have been taken by the boat load. 



EXPLORATIONS IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. 711 

"half a dozen places, while it yet remains to be shown that in the last 
century of its existence the bird bred at any other locality than Funk 
Island. The feather-hunters probably went to Funk Island in the 
spring and resided there until the sea-birds had finished breeding - , 
systematically killing all the Great Auks they could ; and this was kept 
up until, like the Rytina, the Great Auk had been slaughtered out of 
existence. The extermination took place about 1840, and at that date 
American ornithology was in its infancy, so that not a single specimen 
of the Great Auk was preserved out of all the millions that were slain, 
and there are in existence only two stuffed specimens of the Great Auk 
from America. Fortunately, the conditions under which the Auks were 
killed were such as to preserve their skeletons, and the greater part of 
the bones now preserved in museums are from Funk Island, a source 
from which others may doubtless be procured. 

At the time the Grampus expedition was planned, little could be 
ascertained in regard to the exact conditions under which bones of the 
Great Auk had been found at Funk Island, neither could anything be 
learned respecting the character of the island, beyond the fact that it 
was a mere isolated rock. The voyage, as planned, was from Gloucester 
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and thence to the east coast of Newfound- 
land, stopping en route at St. John's and Funk Island. From Funk 
Island the Grampus was to proceed northwards along the coast of New- 
foundland, and through the Strait of Belle Isle to Mingau, stopping at 
those localities where it might seem desirable to gather information, 
collect specimens, or which stress of weather made it necessary to visit. 
From Mingau we were to return to Canso and thence home. It was 
expected that there would be no opportunity for collecting until we 
reached the vicinity of the Bird Bocks, but on account of bad weather 
the Grampus lay by for a day at the Magdalen Islands, and a small 
collection was made of its somewhat scanty avifauna, for although birds 
are quite abundant there, the number of species is small.* 

Only a single mammal was seen, viz., a small Harbor Seal CPhocavitu- 
lina), scarcely suggesting the fact that these islands were once the seat 
of a flourishing Walrus fishery, and that thousands of these huge beasts 
were formerly taken annually, as well as large numbers of Harp Seals. 

The first reference to walruses in this locality occurs in the account 
of Carder's first voyage, in 1534, where, in speaking of Brion's Island, 
he says that "About the said island are very great beastes, as great as 
oxen, which have two great teeth in their mouths like unto elephant's 
teeth, and live also in the sea." 

The writer has been unable to positively identify the Brion's Island 
of Cartier, part of his description applying very well to Bryon Island 
of to day and part applying equally well to Grindstone Island, the

northernmost of the Magdalenes. In spite of the distances, courses, and 
descriptions so carefully recorded in the log-books of the early naviga- 
tors, it is quite impossible to recognize the small places at which they 
stopped, and very difficult to definitely locate any. It is also a little 
puzzling, at first, to see why Cartier and his immediate followers should 
have gone around Newfoundland to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 
but bearing in mind that at that time Newfoundland was supposed to be 
a portion of the American continent, it is easy to see the reason for 
the course pursued. Vessels made Cape Bonavista for a land-fall, and 
thence ran north to Oarpunt (some place on the Labrador coast), at the 
entrance of the Strait of Belle Isle. 

Proceeding down the strait, Chateau Bay and Blanc Sablon were 
often visited, two places that still bear the appellations originally be- 
stowed upon them, and from there the course was to the southwards 
until the Islands of Birds, Brion's Island, and Ramea were successively 
reached. Bamea is another stumbling-block, and from the manner in 
which it is described may have been either the Magdalenes or Prince Ed- 
ward's Island, Charles Leigh's account seeming to point to Amherst 
Island, the southernmost of the Magdalenes, this supposition being the 
more probable from the fact that the Isle of Ramea was a famous place 
for walruses. 

It is now many years since a walrus has been taken in the gulf at 
all, much longer since one was killed on the Magdalenes, and since the 
disappearance of the walrus, the sources of prosperity so much dwelt 
upon by the early voyagers have one by one dwindled away.* 

The goodly fir-trees have become scrubby spruce, the great cods have 
become few and far between, the herring industry is comparatively 
unimportant, and a few short years have sufficed to seriously reduce 
the lobster fishery. All this means want and distress for the popula- 
tion of these islauds, which, never tcowell off at best, has several times 
been saved from starvation by government aid, and once during the 
last twenty-five years forced to eat their very dogs. 

While lying at Grindstone Island we first made the acquaintance of 
the Gannets, whose headquarters are the Bird Bocks, and had a good 
opportunity to watch them fishing. The birds are usually associated in 
small, straggling flocks, and with outstretched necks and eyes ever on 
the lookout for fish, thej fly at a height of from 75 to 100 feet above the 
water, or occasionally somewhat more. The height at which the Gan- 

* The following glowing description by Charles Leigli occurs in Hakluyt, edition of 
1600, p. 201 : 

"Concerning the nature and fruitfulnesse of Brion's Island, Isle Blanche, and of 
Ramea, they do by nature yield exceeding plenty of wood, great store of wild corue 
like barley, strawberries, gooseberries, mulberries, white roses, and store of wilde 
peason. Also, about tbe sayd islands the sea yieldeth great abundance of fish of 
divers sorts. And the sayd islauds also seeme to proffer, through the labour of man, 
plenty of all kinde of our graine, of roots, of hempe, and other necessary commodi- 
ties." 



EXPLORATIONS IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. 713 

net flies above tlie water is proportioned to the depth at which the fish 
are swimming beneath, and Captain Collins tells me that when fish are 
swimming near the surface the Gannet flies very low and darts obliquely 
instead of vertically upon his prey. Should any finny game be seen 
within range, down goes the Gannet headlong, the nearly closed wings 
being used to guide the living arrow in its downward flight. Just 
above the surface the wings are firmly closed, and a small splash ofspray 
shows where the winged fisher cleaves the water to transfix his prey. 
Disappearing for a few seconds the bird reappears, rests for a mo- 
ment on the water, loug enough to swallow his catch, and then rises in 
pursuit of other game. The appetite of the Gannet is limited only by 
the capacity of its stomach, and a successful fisher may frequently be 
seen resting on the water, too heavily laden to rise without disgorging 
a part of its cargo, which it sometimes must do to escape from the 
pathway of an approaching vessel. 

The Guillemot {Gepphus columba) breeds in the caves of Entry Island, 
and a few old birds were seen off Grindstone Island. 

On the 9th of July the Grampus ran over to the Bird Rocks, and 
extensive collections were made of the various birds from whose 
abundance these little rocky islets took their name. They are de- 
scribed in the account of Cartier's first voyage, and from the occasional 
references that occur in Haklnyt seem to have been visited now and 
then for supplies of birds and eggs, a practice still followed by the fish- 
ermen of to-day. Many birds and eggs are taken annually, and although 
egging is prohibited by law after a certain date, game laws are easier 
enacted than enforced, and many eggs are gathered out of season and 
many breeding birds killed. The principal species of birds inhabiting 
the Bird Rocks are the Gannet (Sula bassana): Razorbill (Alca torda); 
Common Murre (Uria troile); Brunnich's Murre (Uria lomvia); and 
Puffin {Fratercuta arctica). Besides these a few Kittiwake Gulls (Rissa 
tridaetyla) are found there, and Leach's Petrel (Oceaiiodroma leucorrhoa) 
breeds in rat-like burrows on the summit of the Great Rock. The Gan- 
net has bred here from time immemorial, and the abundance of these 
great white birds, " which bite even as dogs," led Cartier to christen 
these rocks the " Isles des Margaulx," or Islands of Gannets. 

Cartier's account is as follows: 

We came to these islands, two of which are as sfceepe and upright as any 
wall, ho that it was not possible to climbe them, and betweene them there is a little 
rooke. These islands were as full of hints as any field or medow is of grasse, which 
there do make their nestcs, and in the greatest of them there was a great and infinite 
number of those that wee call Margaulx, which are white and bigger than any 
geese, which were senered in one part. In the other were onely Godetz, bnt toward 
the shoare there were of those Godetz, and Great Apponatz, like to those of that, 
island that we above have, mentioned. We went downe to the. lowest part of the 
least island, where we killed above a. thousand of those Godetz anil Apponatz. We 
put iuto our boates SO many of them as we pleased, for in lesse than one home we 
might have filled thirtie such boats of them. 



714 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, i889. 

In 1597 Charles Leigh wrote that '"'the three Islands of Birds are 
sandy red, but with the multitude of birds upon them they looke white," 
and even as late as the time of Audubon, the Gannets were so numer- 
ous that the tops of the rocks seemed covered with snow. At that 
time they were largely used for bait by the fishermen of Bryou Islaud, 
some forty boats being supplied from this source, and some idea of 
their abundance may be gathered from the fact that Audubon's cap- 
tain told him that on one occasion bis boat's crew, in less than one 
hour, killed six hundred and forty birds with no better weapons than 
sticks. Up to 1860, however, the Gannets were sufficiently numerous 
not only to cover the summits of the rocks, but many of the ledges 
along the sides, and Dr. Bryant estimates that 50,000 pairs were then 
breeding on the top of the Great Rock alone, although these figures 
require to be discounted a little. In 1870 a writ of ejectment was served 
on the bird tenantry occupying the summit of the Great Rock, by the 
erection of a lighthouse, and by 1872 the Ganuets breeding there were 
reduced to 5,000. In 1881 Mr. Brewster found the birds on the Great 
Rock confined to the ledges along the sides, although the Little Rock 
was still densely populated, and the total number of Gannets was esti- 
mated at 50,000. In 1887 not a Gannet was raised on the Little Rock, 
although a few were breeding on the little pillar of rock adjacent to it, 
and M. Turbid placed the number of Gannets at 10,000, considering 
this an increase over previous years. The Murres, Razorbills, and Puf- 
fins have probably suffered somewhat less than their more conspicuous 
comrades, although even among them the decrease must have been 
very great. Still, their smaller size and consequent ability to breed in 
crevices of the rock and on ledges too narrow to accommodate a bulky 
Gannet has been of great service to them, while the Razorbill also 
seems to be learning by experience the desirability of putting an egg 
out of sight whenever practicable. The Puffins find safety in their 
burrowing habits, and breed quite extensively in the decomposed sand- 
stone at the northeastern portion of the Great Rock, as well as under 
the overhanging, inaccessible ledges of the northern side of the Little 
Rock. The little rocky pillar mentioned above is well occupied by 
birds of various species, while owing to the difficulty of scaling this 
islet, the little colony is fairly secure. From its size, the precipitous 
nature of the sides, and the fact that only one landing lies contiguous 
to the breeding birds, the Great Bird Rock must ever remaiu the 
stronghold of this interesting colony of sea- fowl. The Little Rock, 
although formerly said to be difficult, or oven impossible to scale, is 
now easily climbed, owing to the falling of portions of rock, aud as there 
are two places where landing is comparatively easy, the spot is much 
resorted to by fishermen, and the birds in consequence lead a very pre- 
carious existence. 

There is no regular division of the feathered inhabitants of the Bird 
Rocks into large colonies according to species, the separation being

rather by size, Gannets occupying the highest and broadest ledges, 
and Murres and Razorbills taking what is left. There is, of course, 
something of a tendency for little groups of the same species to nest 
together, but Bruunichs and the Common Murre may be seen occupy- 
ing the same ledge. While the erection of the light house on the Great 
Rock did not directly affect the Murres and Razorbills as it did the 
Gannets, it nevertheless led to the decrease of tbe smaller birds in a 
very curious manner. In foggy weather a cannon is tired every half 
hour to warn passing vessels of the hidden danger, and this gun, being 
placed near the northern cliff, is in proximity to the favorite breeding- 
places of tbe Murres and Razorbills. The < flfect produced upon the 
birds is well described by Mr. Brewster, who says : 

At each discharge the frightened Murres fly from the rock in clouds, nearly every 
sitting bird taking its egg into the air between its thighs, and dropping it after 
flying a few yards. Tins was repeatedly observed during our visit, and more than 
once a perfect shower of eggs fell into the water around our boat. So seriously had 
the Murres suffered from this cause that many of the ledges on the side of the rock 
where the gun was fired, had been swept almost clear of eggs. 

This was in 1881, but now M. Turbid says that the birds have be- 
come somewhat accustomed to the Sound, so that the destruction from 
this cause is comparatively small, and we noticed that very few birds 
would fly at the report of a shot-gun, although fired close by them. 

At the time of our visit youug birds of the various species breeding 
at the Bird Rocks were common, with the exception of Gannets and 
Leach's Petrels. The Gannets are the last of the young birds to make 
their appearance, the three that we obtained from the pillar near the 
Little Rock being the first of the season. The difficulty of securing 
Leach's Petrels renders any exact statement regarding them impossi- 
ble, and it can only be said that all of the five eggs obtained contained 
embryos. 

The following table, kindly furnished by M. Turbid, shows the date 
of arrival of the various species, the time of their becoming common, 
and the date at which the first young were noticed.

at Penguin Islands, off Cape la ilune. as the name indicated the possi-

ble former presence of the Great Auk. Weather, however, is a very 
uncertain quantity in or about the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and owing to 
fresh breezes and heavy sea this part of the programme was unavoid- 
ably omitted. These Penguin Islands seem to agree in location with 
the island of Penguin mentioned by M. Hore, who says that " they 
came to part of the West Indies about Cape Briton, shapiug their course 
thence northeastwards until they came to the island of Penguin, which 
is very full of rocks and stones." At the same time " ^bout Cape Bri- 
ton " is extremely vague, and the location of the island is a mere matter 
of conjecture, the case not being helped by a marginal note to the effect 
that the island is in latitude 30 degrees. 

Only two Shearwaters (Puffinus major) were collected between the 
Magdalens and St. John's, Newfoundland, although large flocks of 
these birds were seen near Cape Pace in company with the Sooty 
Shearwater [Puffinus obscurus). From the intimate association of the 
two birds it seemed quite possible that they were merely two phases 
of plumage of the same species, but although every effort was made to 
obtain a series, both by chasing with dories and sailing upon them with 
the schooner, the birds were so extremely wild that only two were ob- 
tained, both Puffinus major. 

A three days' stop was made in St. John's, during which time we 
endeavored to obtain as much information as possible concerning Funk 
Island. Unfortunately the few who had visited the place were bent on 
other errands than collecting Auk bones, and almost the sole fact we 
gathered was that the best landing was on the northerly side. 

On July 21 the Grampus left for Funk Island, steering northward 
past Cape Bonavista, as Jacques Cartier had done three centuries and 
a half before. Funk Island lies 31£ miles north by east from Cape 
Freels, and 25 miles east-southeast from Offer Wadham Island, the lo- 
cality being seldom resorted to except by sealers in early spring and 
occasional fishing boats during the summer. At a distance of GOO and 
1,200 yards to the north of the island, respectively, are two low rocks, 
while within a radius of two miles are numerous shoal-patches, so that 
Funk Island and its vicinity have small attractions for the navigator. 
To add to the dangers of approach, there is no lighthouse, a thing much 
needed. The morning of the 22d found us with a light breeze and smooth 
sea about eight miles distant from Funk Island, but so moderate was the 
weather that it was a little after noon before we were abreast of the east- 
ern end, where, at the distance of about a mile, it Mas proposed to anchor. 
Everything had long been in readiness for a start shoreward, and a short 
time before coming to anchor, a dory containing Mr. Palmer and myself, 
provided with a simple camping outfit and provisions for several days, 
was sent to effect a landing. Owing to the fickleness of the weather 
and frequent occurrence of fogs in this vicinity, our plans had been so 
laid that should occasion require, we might remain on the island and 
prosecute the work of searching for remains of the Great Auk while 



EXPLORATIONS IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. 717 

the Ghrampus sought a more pleasant bertli than the immediate vicinity 
of Funk Island. The locality is bad, not only from the presence of 
numerous rocks and shoals and from the fact that owing to the irregu- 
larities of the bottom, the sea in rough weather breaks badly when the 
depth of water is considerable, but also on account of icebergs, which 
are unpleasant neighbors in a fog. The uncertainty in the way of col- 
lecting at Funk Island is well shown by the fact that while the islet has 
been a regular resort of fishermen from the time of its discovery, the 
only two collectors who visited the spot, Stuvitz, in 1841, and Milne, in 
1873, were obliged to leave hastily on account of threatening weather, 
while another party also, desiring to visit the island in 1887, was unable 
to effect a landing. The light breeze blowing at the time of our visit 
was from the southward, the most favorable direction, since it brought 
the best landing place to leeward. This landing is on the northerly side, 
a fe?r hundred yards to the westward of the eastern point, and consists 
of a step of stone about four feet wide, sloping gently upward from the 
water's edge. Above and below, this step runs out to nothing, although 
at the upper end it terminates in a fissure large enough to accommo- 
date one's fool, the rough rock affording good hold for the foot or hand. 
The rock is here almost perpendicular, so that one may stand on 
the "bench," as this landing is termed, and toss a lead into 20 fathoms 
of water, this depth and steepness of rock offering no resistance to the 
swell which, when this side is to leeward, rises and falls along the rock 
without breaking. Although, as stated, the wind was light at the time 
of our visit, the boat rose and fell along the rock 1 or 5 feet at every 
heave of the sea, while on the south side of the island, where at a dis- 
tance it had seemed quite possible to beach a boat safely, the swell 
proved to be rolling in so heavily that a landing would have been quite 
out of the question, and the same was the case on the northwestern 
end. On the southwestern side of Funk Island, near Gannet Point, is 
another landing place, but this is resorted to only when a northerly 
wind makes landing at the "bench" impracticable. 

Professor Milne, who visited Funk Island July 20, 1873, found a 
great abundance of birds, especially Terns and Murres, but although the 
Arctic Terns were abundant in 1887, eggs and young lying scattered 
over the ground, the Murres were extremely scarce, and the same may 
be said of the Razorbill, these birds having been practically extermi- 
nated by the eggers, who several years ago used to obtain many loads 
of eggs here. The eggs of the Arctic Tern being small and those of 
the Puffin extremely difficult to secure, egging as an occupation is no 
longer profitable, but the number of birds is now so small that the 
visits of the Fogo fisherman will probably prevent any increase of the 
edible species. 

Cartier mentions the Gannet as being found here, and the most likely 
breeding spot for this bird bears the name of Gannet Head, but no 
trace of this species was to be seen, nor is it mentioned by Milne, 



718 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

The Arctic Terns were a veritable nuisance, hovering in a cloud over 
our heads, screaming harshly, and swooping down almost on our heads, 
demonstrations largely due to the presence of their nests. It was curi- 
ous to witness the behavior of the young Terns, who, at our approach, 
would either squat close to the ground or else creep up to some tuft of 
grass or cranny of tne rock, into which they would thrust their heads 
and apparently seem to consider themselves as out of sight. 

Puffins are very numerous; their burrows honeycomb the northern 
slope, where the soil is deepest, and their quaint proprietors, perched 
upon blocks of stone, gravely inspected all our movements. Not uutil 
toward sunset, however, was the real abundance of Puffins manifest, 
but at that time they came flocking home from distant fishing-grounds, 
gathering along the precipitous eastern part of the island in great 
numbers. 

The height of Funk Island is given as 4G feet, but it certainly seems 
much higher, whether viewed from the sea or from the highest part of 
the islet. It is about half a mile long, possibly a little more, and about 
a quarter of a mile wide, the greatest length being from east-southeast 
to west-northwest. The eastern and southwestern portions are precipi- 
tous, but on the north and northwest the rock slopes into the sea, and 
here the Great Auks must have landed, choosing their side according 
to the wind, but having a rough time of it at best. The rock itself 
is a coarse-grained feldspathic granite, traversed by two faults, which 
divide the island into three portions of unequal extent. The north- 
eastern is bare rock, the central portion has a little vegetation here and 
there, while a great part of the southwestern swell, which comprises 
the larger pare of the island, is covered with vegetation and plentifully 
strewn with blocks of granite weathered off from the bed-rock. The 
process of weathering can be seen very well on parts of the middle 
division of the island and at the eastern end, where the rock in places 
forms curious thin ledges that in time will break into slabs. Along the 
line of the southernmost fault is a considerable depression, into which 
considerable water drains, forming pools of brackish water and little 
patches of marsh. The western portion alone was inhabited by the 
Great Auk, this only being accessible to the flightless fowl, which was 
prevented by the character of the rock from either lauding on the east- 
ern end or reaching it after having landed elsewhere. 

The former breeding grounds of Alcaimpennis are pretty well mapped 
out by vegetation which has sprung up since the extermination of the 
Great Auk, and the density of which bears a direct relation to the abun- 
dance of buried remains. (Plate CVI.) 

The soil has been formed partly during the occupancy of the Auk 
and partly since its extinction, the older portion consisting very largely 
of fragments of egg-shells mixed with granite pebbles. This stratum is 
from two inches to nearly a foot in thickness, and is overlaid by a stratum 
of decomposed Auks and decayed vegetation, above which is a thin 
turf of matted roots. 



EXPLORATIONS IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. 719 

Boues are found at all depths, but are most abundant, although poor- 
est in preservation, near the surface. The final cause for the extermi- 
nation of the Great Auk, as previously stated, is said to have been the 
trade in feathers, and the birds are said to have been scalded, plucked, 
and thrown aside, their bodies being so fat that they could be used as 
fuel. Whether this last statement is or is not correct may be uncertain, 
but the others are borne out by the condition of the remains. These are 
most numerous along the crest of the island, where the upturned sod 
reveals vast numbers of bones, interspersed here and there with patches 
of charcoal, showing where the kettles swung in which the birds were 
scalded. The parboiling was done along this ridge for the reason that 
it was away from the sea, and thus would not alarm the birds when 
landing, w T hile at the same time the drainage pools near at hand would 
supply water for the kettles. From this point to the westward the 
bones decrease in numbers, few being found on the southerly slope of 
the island, although even here a deep stroke of the hoe never failed to 
bring to light a bone or two. 

Eemains of the stone iuclosures, "compounds" they were called, into 
which the Auks were driven like so many sheep, and where they were 
kept until wanted, are still to be seen, the most complete lying near 
the western point. These inclosures were readily made by standing 
on edge some of the numerous granite slabs, which seem to have been 
placed by nature just where they were most needed by the bird-hunters. 
Almost in the center of the island are the ruins of three small huts, 
two nearly leveled to the ground, the third, with its walls several feet 
high, forming a conspicuous land-mark on the crest of the island. Tra- 
dition is silent concerning the two older structures, but the third and 
best preserved is variously stated to have been built for the accom- 
modation of a sealing crew, placed here to winter some years ago, and 
to have been erected by a party of guano-seekers in 1863. It is now 
difficult to say which is the correct statement, but as for the others, it 
seems quite probable that they were put up years ago by the extermi- 
nators of the Auk. 

That the feather-hunters must have plied their trade with great vigor 
is shown by the millions of bones scattered over an area of many acres, 
and there is no doubt in the writer's mind but that parties passed the 
entire season here in order to prosecute their work to the best advan- 
tage. The sea would supply them with fresh fish, the island with eggs 
and birds, occasional visits from the mainland would furnish such other 
provisions as might be needed, such as water and wood, so that the 
work of destruction sped merrily on to its end. 

Professor Milne doubted if all the bones he saw were those of the 
Great Auk, but his doubts were without foundation, for it requires care- 
ful searching to obtain remains of any other bird. Besides a large num- 
ber of carefully-selected bones, a barrel full of indiscriminately chosen 
remains was brought away, and yet in all this mass of material there 



720 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889 



was less than a handful belonging to any other species than the Great 
Auk. In one spot, indeed, we did come upon a small number of bones 
of the Murre mixed with a few of the Great Auk, the inference being, 
from the thinness of the deposits and fresh look of the bones, that they 
represented a comparatively recent date, when the Auks were becom- 
ing scarce and other birds were being killed to supply the deficiency. 

An occasional fragment of egg-lining was met with, and one nearly 
perfect, but we came upon no trace of any complete body of an Auk, 
two or three of which were secured by the guano-seekers in L863. The 
large extent of ground covered by the remains prevented as careful an 
examination as would have, been possible in a more restricted area, 
although the first desire of our party was to obtain as good a series of 
bones as was practicable. The most useful digging-implements with 
which we were provided were clam-hoes, and by peeling off the sod 
here and there with one of these, an idea was obtained as to the general 
disposition of remains in various parts of the island. 

On the northerly slope the Puffins had pretty well explored the 
ground, and around their numerous burrows lay little collections of 
bones, among them an occasional bone in a most excellent state of pres- 
ervation, although the larger part were badly weathered. These scat- 
tered bones were a most welcome sight to us as we passed from the bare 
rock to the turf-clad portion of the island, for the many unmistakable 
humeri of the Great Auk were an assurance that our search was not 
likely to prove a failure. 

On the evening of the 22d we returned to the Grampus, as the weather 
promised to be fair on the morrow, and early on the morning of the 23d 
again lauded and proceeded with the work of collecting, snatching a 
little time from our labor to make a hurried circuit of the island. Had 
the enterprise been a comuiercml one, we might have remaiued much 
longer, but as the main zoological object of the voyage had been se- 
cured in the shape of a fine collection of Auk bones, and as much 
remained to be done in connection with fishery researches, we left late 
on the afternoon of July 23 for Seldom-Coine-By, Fogo Island. 

About 16 miles to the westward of Cape Freels the chart shows two 
small dots bearing the legend " Penguin Islands," and although the 
main object of the voyage, so far as remains of the Great Auk were 
concerned, had been successfully accomplished, it was none the less 
desirable to add if possible to the existing store of information in re- 
gard to that extinct bird. These islands are not far from Seldom-Come- 
By, and as the wind was fair, the Grampus accordingly ran over to them 
on the morning of July 24. The appearance of the islets was not en- 
couraging, as they were low, Hat, thickly covered with grass, and by no 
means suggestive of suitable breeding places for the Great Auk, which 
seems to have preferred, or rather been restricted to, bare, isolated 
rocks at some distance from any habitable spot. The turf proved to 
be extremely thick and tough, indicating long-continued growth of veg- 



EXPLORATIONS IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. 721 

etation, and although holes were dug iu many places quite to bed-rock, 
uo bones were thus discovered, nor were any seen at any point of the 
island. The Great Auk, it is true, may once have bred here, but from 
the character of the islands this is extremely doubtful, while the prox- 
imity of the mainland would have made them at all times easy of access 
and rendered the extermination of the bird an easy matter. To-day 
the principal inhabitants of Penguin Islands are Field Mice (Arvicola 
riparia), whose burrows are to be seen on every hand, while paths run- 
ning from one hole to another cover the ground in places with a perfect 
network. A little exploration of the more populous districts showed 
that beneath the surface was a veritable labyrinth of intercommunicat- 
ing burrows, some old and some new. Iu some instances Petrels (Oce- 
anodroma leucorrhoa) were found to have taken possession of deserted 
habitations of the Field Mice, much as the Burrowing Owl occupies the 
dwellings of the Prairie Dog, and from the great abundance of burrows 
it is probable that a considerable number of these little birds breed here. 
The eggs found were perfectly fresh, and as those collected at the 
Bird Eocks on July 0, contained well-advanced embryos, it would seem 
probable that this Petrel raises two broods a year. Although the 
Petrels were breeding here, none were seen about the islands, nor were 
any seen around the Bird Bocks, where they were breeding on the 
summit, so that if the males assist in the work of incubation, they must 
keep well away from the laud until after dark. A few nests of the 
Arctic Tern were scattered over one end of the island, the eggs being 
in an advanced stage of incubation ; one or two Puffins were seen, and 
a Sandpiper or two, but on the whole the results obtained were of a 
negative character. 

On July 29 we arrived at Canada Bay, where there is a small fishing- 
hamlet, and where we were led to hope that seals might be found, a hope 
that was, however, doomed to disappointment, for very few seals were 
seen at Canada Bay, and these were the ever present Harbor Seal. 
Cetaceans were quite abundant, the Dolphin (Delphinus delphis), Por- 
poise (Tur.siojis tursio), and Puffing Pig (Phoca'na communis) being fre- 
quently seen, Tursiops running up the Bras d'Or branch of the bay for 
a mile or so; but, in spite of their abundance, all these species were 
extremely shy, and it was found impossible to approach within striking 
or shooting distance of any of them. Small Finback Whales were also 
seen occasionally, one of which was accustomed to visit the harbor 
toward sunset, making his appearance with great regularity. Both 
land and sea birds were almost entirely lacking, although Mr. Palmer 
succeeded in obtaining a pair of the rare Welch's Ptarmigan (Lagopas 
icelchi) during an excursion to the Cloud Hills, which lie on the western 
side of the bay. On this trip comparatively recent signs of Caribou 
were also noticed. Two small trout-streams empty into the western 
side of Canada Bay, the course of each being interrupted by vertical 
falls, above which no trout were to be obtained. Trout caught in the

722 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



lower part of the larger brook showed very clearly the effect of salt 
water, being slightly silvery, although, owing to the very small size of 
the brook, no " sea-trout" were taken. In the Greenland lakes trout 
are said to feed largely on larvse of the mosquito, and from the abun- 
dance of this insect, as well as the black fly, at Canada Bay, it was very 
likely to be the case there also. An occasional salmon was seen leap- 
ing in the inner harbor, but fish of all kinds were scarce, and cod almost 
totally absent, so great being the dearth of food that dried capliu was 
a common article of diet. 

After lying fogbound for four days the Grampus left Canada Bay on 
August 3, and on the morning of the 4th was off Cape Bauld, a locality 
where, according to reports gathered at Toulinguet, the Penguin (Great 
Auk) was still occasionally seen. While no reliance was placed on these 
rumors, as a matter of duty inquiries were made of the crews of severa] 
fishing-boats, the result being, as was anticipated, that nothing was 
known of the bird in that vicinity. 

Bounding the northern point of Newfoundland, we entered the Strait 
of Belle Isle, and on August 4, owing to stress of weather, the Grampus 
put in to Black Bay, on the Labrador coast. Little or no collecting 
was done here, owing to the fact that there was nothing to be collected, 
animals of all kinds being very scarce, although the usual Harbor Seal 
was present and a few Ravens were seen, but these were too wary to 
be taken. The Black River, which empties into Black Bay, is a salmon- 
stream of some importance, the fishing privilege being rented by Mr. 
William Ellworthy. Sea-trout are said to be abundant in the pool at 
the mouth of Black River, but owing to the overcast sky and low tem- 
perature at the time of our visit, they remained in deep water, and 
only one or two young salmon were taken here. Very small brook- 
trout abound in a tributary of Black River, and in one pool a number 
of large trout were taken, the most noteworthy fact in regard to them 
being that, while all were living under similar conditions, two were 
brilliantly colored, while the remainder were extremely dull, like the 
trout taken later on at Mingan. 

August 11 found the Grampus at Mingan, where it was hoped we 
might be able to secure specimens of the great Gray Seal {Ralich&rus 
gryphus), or, as it is locally known, the Horse-head. This, the largest of 
the North Atlantic seals, is by no means common in museums, and ap- 
pears not to be very abundant at any locality, playing but a small part 
in the seal fisheries. According to Dr. C. Hart Merriam,to whom we 
are indebted for information as to the whereabouts of the Gray Seal, 
the Mingau group is the only locality in the Gulf of St. Lawrence where 
this animal is found, with the possible exception of Anticosti. The 
Gray Seal occurs on the south side of Harbor Island, on Mingan Island, 
and at the Perroquets, these last being the most frequented. Like 
other members of the seal family, it is fond of crawling out upon the 
rocks, especially on sunny days, when it will lie basking in the sun- 



EXPLORATIONS IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. 723 

shine for hours at a time. The seals do not come on shore at any 
convenient spot, but at a limited number of chosen localities, and these 
vary according to the force and direction of the wind. Except in very 
light breezes the lee-side of the island is selected, not entirely on ac- 
count of the difficulty of effecting a landing on the windward side, but 
;ilso because the seal relies very largely upon its acute senses of smell 
and hearing to warn it of approaching danger from the land. The 
chosen landing-places are where a shelf of rock, raised but little above 
the level of the sea, descends vertically for several feet beneath, thus 
enabling the seal to plunge head first into the water and disappear at 
ouce from sight. Before landing, the animal will swim back and forth 
several times with head raised and eye, ear, and nose on the alert to 
detect any sign of danger, the wary nature of the creature being well 
shown by the fact that almost immediately after emerging from the 
water, the animal turns completely around so as to lie with the head sea- 
ward and in readiness for an instant dive. The fairer the day and the 
lighter the breeze, the more readily the seals come ashore, while dur- 
ing rough weather they not only do not land so often but are more 
watchful when they do come out. The time for hauling out varies with 
the state of the tide, and as nearly all the places where the right con- 
ditions, as noted above, obtain, are covered at high water, it is between 
the middle of the ebb and middle of the flood that the seals come 
ashore. 

The hearing of this seal is extremely acute, as we had a most excel- 
lent opportunity of ascertaining during the first of our attempts to 
secure a specimen. A party had been landed on Mingan Island, and 
while Mr. Palmer was engaged in searching for birds and botanical 
specimens, Captain Collins and myself were looking for seals. The 
wind at the time was blowing rather freshly from seaward, and a num- 
ber of Gray Seals were discovered hauled out on the lee-side at a spot 
so situated that there was unfortunately no cover nearer than 150 yards, 
and even this was accessible only by crossing a patch of shingle some 
50 yards wide and in full sight of the seals. Lying flat upon our 
stomachs we began slowly and painfully wriggling across this open 
space, the seals apparently taking no notice of our actions. About 
half the distance had been traversed when the distant report of the 
small collecting-gun, sounding no louder than a faint crack of a whip, 
caused the entire group of seals to plunge into the water as promptly 
as if they had been waiting for some preconcerted signal. Upon com- 
ing to the surface at a sale distance from shore the seals swam back 
and forth looking for the cause of the disturbance and diving whenever 
the pop of the collecting-gun reached their ears. No enemy being 
visible and everything becoming quiet, they once more returned to 
shore, clambering out with more ease than one might suppose such 
creatures would exhibit. No use is made of the hind flippers when on 
laud, progression being effected by the front limbs and the abdominal 



724 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

muscles, the hinder portion of the body being bent slightly upward, 
the hind-legs sticking out stiffly in the rear. 

These seals are occasionally taken by the Indians for the oil and skin, 
the animals being either shot while lying on the rocks, or while swim- 
ming in water sufficiently shallow for the body to be recovered by means 
of a long gaff. As a rule one Indian is provided with a seal-skin suit, 
cap included, and his part of the game is to crawl about the rocks im- 
itating the motions and cry of a seal, while Indian number two is con- 
cealed near at hand with a birch-bark canoe in readiness. No shot 
is fired unless there is almost a certainty of either killing or mortally 
wounding a seal where it can be secured, a wounded animal being 
gaffed and towed ashore. 

The Harp Seal (Phoca gramlandica) also occurs at Mingau, and ani- 
mals were seen that probably belonged to this species, although, as none 
could be taken, it is impossible to speak positively in regard to the 
matter. The Harbor Seal (Phoca vitulina) is common about all the 
islands and in the channel between Harbor Island and the mainland. 
A small Pike Whale (Balcenoptera rostrata) was accustomed to cruise 
through the channel with tolerable regularity, but no other cetaceans 
were seen in the vicinity, although fish were said to be abundant, and 
Caplin were seen in small schools. An effort was made to kill this 
whale with a bomb lance while it was busily engaged in pursuing a 
school of lant, but although the animal at first seemed to pay no at- 
tention to the boat, yet upon being fired at, although missed, the whale 
immediately left, showing his senses of sight and hearing to be very 
acute. The course of the whale could be quite readily traced, the point 
at which he was about to make his appearance being indicated by a 
circle of wildly leaping little fish, the nose of their pursuer emerging a 
second or two later. Several times the animal rose almost vertically, 
about a third of his length appearing above the water, and on these 
occasions the conspicuous white bars across the flippers served to iden- 
tify the species. 

The birds were moving southwards, and although young Eider Ducks 
(Somateria Dresseri) in the dowu were taken, the Black Duck (Anas 
obscura) and white-winged Coot (Melanetta velvetina) Mere seen flying 
southwards in considerable numbers. The Eider is said to breed here- 
abouts in the bushes near the shore, but the only young specimens seen 
were taken, as just stated, at Mingan Island, and had probably been 
raised there. Large flocks of Bonaparte's Sandpiper (Actodromas fusci- 
collis) were gathered around the tide-pools on the northern end of Min- 
gau Islands and a few Curlew were observed, these being extremely shy. 
Gulls (Larus argentatus smithsonianus) were abundant, and are said to 
breed on Mingan, although the only young birds taken were obtained 
from nests under the evergreens of Harbor Island. The Gannet for- 
merly bred in small numbers at the Perroquets, but the continual taking 
of their eggs by the Indians residing near by, has nearly extirpated

them, and but few were seen, none being breeding birds. Puffius ( Frd- 
tercula arctica), with well-advanced young, and Murres (Uria troile, 
were found at thePerroquets, and Guillemots (Ccppli us grylle), in spotted 
plumage, near Mingan. The Canada Grouse (Dendragapus canadensis) 
was occasionally seen at Mingan. These birds were extremely tame, 
and when Hushed from the- ground frequently alighted in low spruces, 
where they would allow themselves to be approached as near as twenty 
or fifteen feet. 

The Mingan River is a noted salmon stream, while its tributary, the 
Manitou, abounds in trout, salmon being prevented by a fall from as- 
cending this stream for more than 3 miles. The so-called Sea Trout is 
usually plentiful at the mouth of the Mingan from half flood to half ebb, 
and many large ones, averaging about two pounds each, are taken in 
gill-nets by the few Indians residing here. Owing to rough weather 
and heavy rains few fish were taken during our stay, those at the 
mouth of the river being the silvery sea-trout, and those up the stream 
the dull-colored variety. 

The unfavorable weather prevented our obtaining any of the desired 
seals, and on August 20th the Grampus proceeded to Perce, reaching 
that place next morning. Perce is a place of considerable interest to 
the naturalist from the fact that Perce Pock is the abode of a large 
rookery of Cormorants (Phahierooorax dilophus), while the precipitous 
seaward side of Bonaveuture Island is occupied by Gannets, this being 
the third of their breeding-places on the Atlantic coast, and, next to 
the Bird Rocks, the most extensive. Dr. Bryant in 1860 estimated the 
number of Gannets breeding at Bonaventure to be 250,000, but this 
must be considered as entirely too high. Whatever the number may 
once have been, at the date of our visit it would not apparently ex- 
ceed 3,000, although this is merely a guess, time being insufficient to 
make a careful estimate by counting various sections of the colony. 
Although the cliffs on the seaward side of Bonaventure Island are 
250 feet in-beight and nearly vertical, it is said that a considerable num- 
ber of eggs are obtained from the uppermost ledges, some of which may 
be reached directly from the summit and others by the aid of ropes. 
The conservatism of the Gannet is well shown by the fact that al- 
though Perce* Island is only a mile away, and its summit perfectly inac- 
cessible, not a Gannet breeds there. Favored by a light inshore wind, 
we were able to approach sufficiently near the base of the cliff to secure* 
four young Gannets, by shooting them where the character of the ledge 
was such that a bird when killed would fall into the sea. 

On the 9th of July we had obtained at the Bird Bocks, Gannets from 
one to four days old, very small and almost naked. Here, forty-three 
days later, the young were very far from being able to fly, and although 
they had attained a weight of five pounds were still covered with 
long, soft down, the wings being so feebly developed that it would 
evidently be some time before they could leave the nest. The instinct 



72 b' REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18& 

to keep still must be strong in the little Gannets, for often but a few 
inches lie between them and destruction, some of the rocky shelves 
being so narrow as to cause one to wonder how eggs and young escape 
being swept off' by wind and rain. 

Perce or Arch Bock, is a vertical mass of rock, 288 feet high, and ap- 
parently inaccessible, although some years ago an enterprising fisher- 
man succeeded in reaching the summit,* then as now occupied by birds. 
The greater part of these are Cormorants (Phalacrocorax dilophus), but 
a few Gulls (Larus argentatus) mingle with them, and two Blue Herons 
(Ardea herodias) were also seen. The Cormorants are said to feed 
largely on the refuse of the fish dressed for drying by the Perce fisher- 
men, but numbers may be seen in the morning starting outfor more dis- 
tant fishing grounds. It was to intercept some of these birds, and to 
collect any others that were to be obtained, that early in the morning 
we started for Arch Island, where long before daybreak the gulls had 
begun their clamor. The gull is ever complaining about something, 
and at almost any hour of the night the querulous cry of some wakeful 
bird may be heard. At the Miugan Islands the gulls and terns had 
been a decided nuisance, following us everywhere in a clamorous crowd, 
by cry and action pointing out our whereabouts to the ever suspicious 
seals. Now we found them circling around the island, along whose 
lofty summit the cormorants were arrayed in straggling groups of three 
or four, craning their long necks over the edge of the cliff. Some were 
already returning from fishing trips, while others were starting out 
for their morning work, winging their way with out-stretched necks and 
heavy wing-beats, their black forms sharply outlined against the morn- 
ing sky. Fishing-boats were putting off from shore, their black hulls, 
and red, tanned sails adding to the picturesqueness of the scene, while 
the bold, red summit of Perce Mountain shone brilliantly over all. In 
the role of collector, however, the birds had prior claims to our atten- 
tion, and before breakfast several cormorants and guillemots (Cepphus 
grylle) were secured, these last being the first adults of the species taken 
since leaving the Magdalens. The little guillemots are wonderfully ex- 
pert swimmers and divers, and in rough water their small size frequently 
enables them to elude pursuit, even when they do not take wing. On 
this occasion, however, the water was smooth, the birds could be read- 
ily discerned whenever they rose to the surface, and pursuers and pur- 
sued were more on an equality than is usually the case. 

Although a few petrels and phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicarius) were 
taken on the homeward voyage, the work of collecting practically ended 
with our morning excursion at Perce. Naturally the most valuable por- 
tion of the collection consisted of the remains of the Great Auk, which, 
as indicated by the humeri, represented over seven hundred individ- 
uals. The humerus, however, is by far the most abundant bone, some

EXPLORATIONS IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. 727 

portions of the skeleton, like the'brea'st-bone and pelvis, very rarely be- 
ing found in a good state of preservation. Still it may be said that 
the collection made by the Grampus party equals, or exceeds, the com- 
bined sum of all other Great Auk remains preserved in museums, for 
besides the large number of individual bones, about ten complete, or 
nearly complete, skeletons have been made up, one of which has been 
presented to the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Massa- 
chusetts, and one to the American Museum of Natural History in New 
York City. 

Next in importance to the bones of the Great Auk were the pair of 
Welch's ptarmigans, secured by Mr. Palmer, these being the second 
pair ever taken, and the only birds in summer plumage. The rest of 
the material needs no special mention, although the numerous eggs, 
embryos, nestlings, skins, and skeletons form a very valuable addition 
to the collection of the U. S. National Museum, and their importance is 
enhanced by the fact that all the ^specimens were carefully prepared. 

It is very evident, upon comparing our own observations with the 
accounts of previous observers, that the sea-birds have greatly decreased 
in numbers, even during the last decade. The gauuets have suffered 
the most; the murres and razorbills next; while the puffins, on the con- 
trary, may even have increased in numbers, owing to the fact that their 
burrowing habit makes the task of obtaining their eggs too difficult to 
be profitable. While regret at the diminishing number of the sea birds 
is partly a matter of sentiment, and the naturalist in particular can 
but deplore their loss, there is, however, a practical side to the question, 
although the relations between fish, birds, and men are so complicated 
that little can be stated positively in regard to the loss or gain due to 
the birds. Naturally the sea-fowl do not have the same economic im- 
portance as in the early days of the Newfoundland fisheries, although 
they are still used for bait and food, many being killed by the fishermen 
for this latter purpose, and large quantities of eggs are gathered an- 
nually. In this manner the birds are of direct value to fishermen, while 
indirectly they are of much service in pointing out the presence of fish. 

On the English coast the actions of gannets often show the position 
of schools of herring, while on our own shores they frequently indicate 
the appearance of schools of mackerel. Gulls and terns, shearwaters 
and auks feed largely upon capeliu and lant; ami as these small fishes 
are preyed upon by schools of cod, their presence is frequently an indi- 
cation that larger fish are not far off; and if the feathered fishermen are 
compelled to seek their prey at a distance, the chances are that their hu- 
man competitors will be obliged to do so also. In this connection it 
may be worth while to note that when at Funk Island the puffins were 
apparently doing their fishing at some distance from the island, and 
that two fishing-boats from Fogo tried for cod in the vicinity without 
success. Thequt'stion of the quantity offish eaten by sea-birds is one, 
which must also be taken into consideration ; and while at first sight it 



728 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

might seem that the destruction of fish-eating birds could be only favor- 
able to the fish, it may be said that uutil much more is known regard- 
ing the food of the birds, the exact relations existing between birds and 
fish can not be determined. The gaunet is charged with devouring 
large quantities of fish, and while the charge is undoubtedly true, it 
would seem better for the present to protect the bird than to run any 
risk of exterminating a species which on both sides of the water has de- 
creased from 20 to 50 per cent, during the last twenty years. So nicely 
are the economies of nature often adjusted, that interference with them 
often leads to wholly unexpected results ; and it may well be that in de- 
stroying fishes that feed upon the spawn of larger species, the sea-birds 
far more than offset the harm they may do by devouring the young of 
food-fishes. 

Although the many favors received during the voyage have been 
duly credited in the report of Captain Collins, I would yet like to add 
my own acknowledgments for the many favors received during the 
voyage, especially to the Rev. M. Harvey, and to Commander Wake- 
ham. 

In conclusion, I desire to thank Captain Collins, not only for his in- 
dorsement of the plan at the outset, and for his personal aid and inter- 
est in every detail of the varied work of collecting, but for the many 
courtesies received at his hands during the two months' cruise of the 
Grampus.

These contain many doctrinal and metaphysical words and phrases, of San- 
scrit or Pali origin, which may be briefly translated, as follows: the form of 
the record, names, etc., being transposed in order to render it intelligible to 
Western readers : 

" This bronze image of 'The Buddha of Five Wisdoms, ' was made by Saburo- 
biyoye Katsutane, son of the great caster, Yoshitane Tsuji of the Fujiwara clan, 
whose title was Tajima no Kami, Anson, who lived at the Port of Yasuno in the 
Province of Seishiu (Ise). 

" He respectfully cast it for Shichirouyemon Tadanori Takamine, who lives in the 
town of Matsuzaka in the district of Jid'aka, Seishiu (Ise), whose religious name and 
the religious name of his wife are given, and 'who desire the blessings of future life 
for (the souls of) their Fathers, Mothers, and of six unnamed relatives, and for 
themselves.' 

"It was respectfully offered by them to the temple of Joshozan Soan in Yamada, 
Seishiu (Ise), on the 15th day 9th month of the ist(rat) year of the Period of Keian— 
October 30th, 1648, when it was reverently consecrated by Slionin (Rev'd) Kwansei- 
kudatsu, of the Society of Benren (Distinguished pure Lotus), twenty-first Priest of 
the temple of Sanyenzan Zojo, in the district of Shiba, Yedo, Province of Bushiu

(Tokugawa PERIOD ) 



ON A BRONZE BUDDHA IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 1 



By Charles De Kay. 



The fine arts of Japan have been known in the West for many cen- 
turies and like the cognate arts of China have received the sincerest 
form of flattery, imitation. Yet a true knowledge is still to come. Be- 
tween a barbarian contempt for eastern art and the claim of a recent 
Japanese art-commission returning - from a voyage around the world, 
that the only living art to-day is that of Nippon, there must be a mid- 
dle term. We are only beginning to assume toward the oriental mind 
that attitude of sympathy which is necessary to the understanding of 
its products. Moreover, we are only on the threshold of the historical 
and legendary view of the development of the fine arts of the extreme 
Orient, which forms the second and almost equally important basis for 
appreciation. So it comes that, notwithstanding the wealth of exam- 
ples of many branches of the fine arts belonging to the Middle Flowery 
Kingdom and to Nippon, such matters as porcelain and bronze are 
still regions largely unexplored. In porcelains the beautiful book of 
Stanislas Julien is invaluable ; with regard to bronzes from Japan the 
old writer Kaempfer and the comparatively modern F. von Siebold 
did excellently for their time and generation, yet have left the field 
open for separate and exhaustive treatises. 

One branch of art throws light on another. Thus the French work 
by M. Gonse and the still more useful volumes lately published in Lon- 
don by Dr. Anderson, dealing as they do very largely with the paint- 
ings or water colors of the Japanese, will be of inestimable service to 
the man who has the leisure and talents to devote a book to bronzes 
from Japan. The present sketch, which revolves round the bronze 
Buddha lately bought for the National Museum, does not presume to 
speak of more, than a few pieces belonging to the two chief religions 
of Japan, namely, to Buddhism, the popular faith introduced from the 
mainland about twelve hunched years ago by Koreans and Chinese, 
who brought with them a transformed species of the great religion 
born in but ejected from India; and to Shintoism, the former state re- 
ligion of Japan. The latter appears to have been formed from Chinese

730 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889 



Confucianism, to have absorbed the original spirit and hero-worship of 

the Japanese, and to have borrowed .something from Buddhism itself. . 

Bronze work resembles other Sinico- Japanese art in its apparent 
lack of distinctiveness, its seeming unity of impression on those who » 
have not studied it well. As the individuals of an Asiatic or African 
people seem to be all alike until familiarity with them develops as great 
differences, man from man, as we find in Europe, so a close examina- 
tion of Japanese bronzes brings one to the point where the work of the 
different epochs betrays different characteristics, and individual work- 
men in metal emerge from the common herd of designers and casters 
into artists of renown. In the east great respect is paid to tradition 
in art. Families of artisans have inherited certain ways of work. Ke- 
ligion has been powerful enough to counteract the impulse to be orig- 
inal by deviating from the models of the past. Difficult as the ques- 
tion must be until some one resident in Japan, having access to the 
temples and museums under government control, and yet acquainted 
with the contents of public and private collections in Europe, shall 
found a system of the history of Japanese bronzes, it is possible to dis- 
tinguish three grand epochs. 

The first is represented by the meager yields of grave-mounds. An 
early wave of conquest appears to have come from the south, favored 
by the prevailing winds and currents, and brought the men of bronze 
weapons and implements, before whom the native race, perhaps the 
hairy people called Ainus, perhaps a mixture of this people with set- 
tlers from Korea who had iron weapons, gradually receded toward the 
north. The second is the great religious epoch, started with a wave of 
Buddhism from Korea about the time that Europe was settling down 
after the conquests of the heathen, when missionaries were sallying 
out from Borne on the one side, and Ireland on the other, and things 
were shaping themselves for Charlemagne to found his empire. To 
this epoch belong the gigantic Buddhas at Kara and Kamakura. The 
third period is associated with the political supremacy of the Tokog- 
awa clan, and runs from about 1600 nearly to our day, say 1868. The 
Japanese are now in the fourth period, where they are profoundly in- 
fluenced by the western world in their arts as well as in their polity, 
and, as many native and foreign observers think, very unfortunately 
influenced. 

From considering Japanese bronzes to have a marked family like- 
ness, one soon learns to note the greatest distinctions among them. In 
general, one may say that intricate design and bold combinations of 
high and low relief, technical knowledge in founding, and fantastic 
subjects, belong to the third or flourishing epoch lately ended. Not 
that very beautiful, simple, big work is lacking to the present century, 
but it does not represent the rule. 

But however we may distinguish, however we may, according to tem- 
perament or training, prefer on the one hand the big sober work of 



ON A BRONZE BLlDDHA. 731 

earlier centuries, or, on the other, the enormously clever design, the 
bewildering luxuriance of form and suggestion, shown during the 
period of two centuries and a half lately elapsed, we can not withhold 
wonder and admiration from the Japanese for their work in bronze in 
all epochs. It has the stamp of individuality as most European work 
has not. Bronzes with us are too apt to look like things turned out of 
a hopper, like buttons from a mill. The profusion of ornament which 
alarms and irritates fastidious people who have formed their taste on 
masterpieces surviving from the great Greek and Italian epochs, be- 
comes interesting so soon as the meaning of the various decorative 
motifs dawns on them. Thus the crane is associated with a certain 
sage, hero, or saint who is a sort of patron god of knowledge and long- 
evity. The tortoise is a symbol wishing one long life; the peach blos- 
som means that the giver desires the recipient to be beloved and to 
become the parent of lovely children. 

There is a mighty cosmogony, there is a vast and bewildering hagi- 
ology, there is a labyrinth of legend, in which Buddhist ascetics, local 
Buddhas, old heroes of the people, animals endowed with magical pow- 
ers, and even inanimate things which take on life, are lit subjects for 
the potter and the founder in bronze. The result is that one is tempted 
to say that no country has ever shown bronzes which contain so much 
human interest by way of subject, so much point with respect to useful- 
ness in temple and house, so much elegance of finish, beauty of shape, 
and originality of design as the Japanese. 

By far the greater part of the bronzes in Japan have to do with the 
service of a temple. There are many other uses for the metal, of course, 
such as coinage, weapons, ornaments for the person, utensils for the 
house, decorative pieces, boxes, trays, flower-holders, and what not. 
But the houses of nobles in Japan are far from luxurious, and as a rule 
the costliest things are appointments of or gifts to a temple. Shiu- 
toism in its purer form had no idols and few altar-ornaments in its tem- 
ples, but Buddhism in the form which it has taken far from its seat in 
India, encouraged these luxuries. Japanese writers who belong to the 
comparatively free-thinking sects which may be allied to Confucianism 
have always reproached the native Buddhists with using the fine arts 
to captivate the multitude, deceiving the eye with pictures and statu- 
ettes and the understanding with monkish tricks. They have taken 
much the same attitude toward Buddhism that the Reformation took 
toward Roman Catholicism. 

On the other hand the same thing was cynically defended on the 
ground that Buddhist monks were useful in keeping the common peo- 
ple ignorant and steeped in superstition. Or, the argument was, that 
it suited a certain phase of mind. u People may go so far as to destroy 
those who hold to names and pictures," wrote a Japanese apologist in 
1690 in his preface to the Buts-zo-dsu-i, translated by Dr. J. Hoffman 
into German ; "yea, to give to the flames the wooden statues of Buddha. 
But will the silly layman for that understand any better the glorious 






732 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



purpose of upward endeavor! The Most Illuminated whom mankind 
worships, and who in his great mercy did good to all creatures and 
brought them to salvation, verily he willed that also the silly common 
man should strive gradually, step by step, to Perfection." The book is 
a description of native and foreign saints; the writer, apparently by no 
means a vigorous or ardent believer in Buddhism, makes a shrewd ap- 
peal to that class of minds in all parts of the world which sees in reli- 
gious forms a wholesome regimen for the ignorant. 

But since 1874 Buddhism has lost the support of the Shoguns and 
feudal upper class, owing to the practical abolishment of their power. 
They were patrons of Buddhism from policy, if not from conviction, 
and the bronze gifts to temples have fallen off. Moreover, they were 
patrons of bronze work not religious in purpose, and now they, or such 
as can be said to represent them, dress like Europeans, aspire to Euro- 
pean habits, and use foreign furniture. Last, but not least of all, the 
full establishment of commerce with the West, before the country was 
prepared for it, appears to have had for its first effects a singularly 
rapid and universal lowering of the artistic quality of all objects of art, 
because cheap and quickly fabricated articles in enormous quantities 
had to be supplied to America and Europe. From these causes of dis- 
couragement the production of good bronzes, that is to say, bronzes of 
a high artistic, not merely a fine technical quality, has undoubtedly 
fallen away. 

Some connoisseurs prefer the most important castings in bronze made 
by the early Buddhists of Japan, owing to their grandeur, simplicity, 
and noble massiveuess. Such are the colossal Yakushi in the temple 
at Nara and the famous Daibuts, or seated figure of Buddha, cast by 
Kimimaro in A. D. 74i». In pottery and faience the same taste is likely 
to prefer the comparatively small and undecorated pieces which the 
native collectors treasure in silken bags and fondle with the amiable 
folly of him who is ridden by his hobby. Professor Morse describes 
these amateurs as aghast at the overdeoorated vases which modern 
Japanese potters fabricate for us, and which the dealers sell us for 
pieces of the great epochs. 

Besides the colossi mentioned there are other images in bronze of a 
larger size, but they have rarely left the country. A seated Buddha of 
this sort, which was exported to the United States before the Japanese 
became attentive to the need of preserving the monuments of Japan, 
had a romantic career of neglect and discovery in New York ; it is now 
in the National Museum at Washington, thanks to the knowledge of 
Mr. Edward Greey, the author of various translations from the Japa- 
nese (Plate CV1I). 

It has a bronze halo, and differs from the beautiful and impressive 
seated Buddha at Kamakura in size and in the position of the fore- 
fingers. These do not touch each other along the two upper joints, but 
lie one within the other. A slight trait of this kind is of the greatest 
importance to a Buddhist. It marks the difference between figures 



ON A BKONZE BUDDHA. 733 

of the greatest of all Buddhas at various moments of his ecstacy or ab- 
sorption into Nirvana, or it distinguishes the Buddha from foreign or 
local saints who have presumably reached the Buddhahood by merito- 
rious pondering. He has the famous knob on his forehead, about 
which many legends revolve; also the short round curls over his head, 
supposed to be the snails which guarded him from sunstroke, and he 
carries the mark on the top of his head. He has the large ears with 
their lobes pierced and distended, but no earrings. The figure repre- 
sents Buddha, after having taught his doctrine, merging himself into 
Nirvana. To an adept, the position of his thumbs aud forefingers ex- 
presses a world of hidden meanings. 

The figure is luckily provided with a copious inscription which is 
couched in phrases anything but easy of translation, owing to the 
curious phraseology of monkish scribes. A Japanese does not use 
idioms like ours in ordinary matters, but when it comes to writing he 
is further influenced by the enigmatical style of a literature profoundly 
influenced by that of China. To this we must add the peculiarity of 
expressions that were meant originally to translate Sanscrit or Hindoo 
modes of religious speech which have been further filtered through an 
obsolete form of Chinese by persons devoid of an exact knowledge of 
tongues. The sense of the lettering, according to Mr. Greey, is that 
this, "The Buddha of the Five Wisdoms," was cast by Saburo Biyoye 
Katsutare in the province of Ise, and was dedicated to a temple in 
Yamada, province of Ise, in the year 1648. Then follow the religious 
names (for the Japanese laymen took religious names as freely as Catho- 
lics who enter monasteries do to-day) of the person who paid for the 
statue. Then come the religious names of friends and those of the dead 
whose souls the giver wished to benefit thereby. Then the priest who 
dedicated the pieces is mentioned and he slily slips in the names of his 
own ancestors. Finally appears the name of the scribe whom the priest 
employed to carve the words. The motto of " The Buddha of the Five 
Wisdoms" is as follows: All the world can share the blessings of Budd- 
hism. It may be noted that in Japan the number five has especial sanc- 
tity. Thus there are five elements, five yearly festivals, five chief 
colors, five great laws, five tones in music. The temple where this 
Buddha was dedicated was that of Joshagan Soan in Yamada. One 
would like to know if it has survived the wreck of time, the fall of puppet 
emperors and guardian nobles, of the old worship and the iconoclasm 
preached by Christians. Shall we suppose that the priest of the temple 
at Yamada was like that Yekeo Hoshi who is said to have recited, seated 
mournful in his neglected fane, these verses, paraphrased by Dickens: 

My mountain dwelling's roof of thatch 

Is with Yahemugura moss o'ergrown ; 
Of passers-hy no glimpse I catch, 

I dwell uncheerdd and alone ; 
'Tis antiinm time 
And mankind dread the rie'roua clime. 



734 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. - 

Without doubt there was a celebratiou of Mi-cho, or opening of the 
eyes, when this figure was dedicated in some such temple as that of Ye- 
keo Hoshi, deserted by the fickle populace for more attractive fanes. 
The ceremonies were as elaborate and solemn as that in Catholic coun- 
tries on the dedication of a chapel. Pieces of colored paper were pasted 
over his eyes, and at a given moment torn off, so that the image might 
gaze on his worshipers. Not far off stood such a great incense-burner 
as the hall of a shrine always shows. Mounting on steps, attendant 
priests constantly replenished it with incense, the offerings of the de- 
vout, bought at extortionate prices on the temple grounds. On either 
side of the alcove where the Buddha sat enthroned, and well outside, 
rose, we may be sure, two temple lanterns exquisitely cast in bronze. 
The roof or lid, of the lantern has in high relief the dragou of the rain- 
clouds holding the magic jewel in his claws. About the pagoda-shaped 
lantern itself, four fishes spring outward like gargoyles ; they are mod- 
eled in the round and are very lively looking animals out of their own 
element. Below the lantern is a bamboo grove with ascetics in half 
relief. Then coraes a frieze of animals representing the hours and the 
houses of the zodiac. The dragon appears on the stem, answering with 
that above to the " waters above and the waters below," while the basis 
of the cosmogony shows in the foot of the lantern with tortoises and 
conventional waves to represent the ocean. 

The whole piece symbolizes the world — water, earth, air, fire, and 
ether — while the Buddhist saints occupy a significant position high up 
above the reach of time (the hours and zodiac), close to the palace of 
heaven (the pagoda), and the realms of ether (the upper dragon). 

Let us examine the incense-burners. They are large, but not of the 
size that the great popular temples show. Elephant heads form the 
two arms, and the survival in Japan of Hindoo ideas in religion is fur- 
ther seen iu the frieze, which consist of Rakans or magical saints some- 
what like the Rishis of India. The bowl into which the incense is 
thrown is poised upon the heads of three naked wrestlers, who squat 
under the burden, but are so gross of form, so mighty of muscle, that 
they bear the round jar with little suggestion of discomfort. No dra- 
gon motif is used here, for in China and Japan that fabulous beast 
appears to have largely lost his connection with fire and the sun, in 
order to undertake the care of rain, cloud, and moisture everywhere. 

With some plausibility the dragon is thought to be one remnant of 
the original native religion taken up by Buddhism in China and Japan. 
Compared with the monster as depicted in stone and colors by artists 
of our Middle Ages, it is a graceful creature. Dragons a foot or two 
long, made of an incredible number of pieces held together, are among 
the marvels of Japanese workers in iron and bronze ; great prices are 
paid when the foundry-man or iron-smith is a famous artist. They 
sometimes have a character of their own which justifies one in placing 
them among serious works of art. When taken in the hand their flex-

ibilityand coldness make them seem alive, while their singular motions 
and threatening look express capitally the fierceness and wayward na- 
ture attributed to a symbol of the least stable of elements. To us and 
to skeptical natives it is a curious, ingenious plaything, but to the Jap- 
anese of the old religious or to the Buddhist, it means a good deal more : 
it is a talisman to exorcise the dangers that lurk in sky and sea. 

Here, then, are such specimens of Japanese bronze-work as Ameri- 
cans can examine in their own country, either in museums, in the shops 
of dealers, or in the private galleries of the country. Perhaps too much 
has been made of the degeneracy of Japanese workmen in these days. 
It is true that they seem no longer to have a fixed and definite aim for 
their energies, but that could hardly be when in political matters all is 
floating, all is changing. Yet they still show wonderful skill, patience, 
and fertility of resource ; they seem able to imitate almost anything from 
the past, if not to originate great designs. In metal work especially 
are they wonderfully strong ; it is not too much to say that they lead 
the world for variety of design, beauty of finish, boldness of relief, and 
readiness to follow new leads. Despite the croaking of critics native 
and critics foreign, who shall say that when the genius of these workers 
in metals shall have adapted itself to the new state of things, it will not 
take another flight into the realms of high art ?

American Ornithologists' Union. Supplement | to the | Code of Nomenclature 
aud Check-List | of | North American Birds | adopted by the American Ornitholo- 
gists' Union | Prepared by | a Committee of the Union | | New York | Ameri- 
can Ornithologists' Union, 1889, 8vo., pp. 23. 

As explained in the preface, it consists "of the tenable species and subspecies, genera aud 
subgenera, added since the publication of the Cheek-List, together with any necessary 
eliminations and valid changes in nomenclature made since the Check-List was issued." 
The supplement here presented records the ruling of the Committee on about one hundred 
•distinct questions, involving additions to the Check-List or changes in its nomenclature. 
The matter is classified under three heads: I, Additions; II, Eliminations; III, Changes of 

Nomenclature. 
The additions number twenty-three species, and forty-three subspecies, one genus, and three 
subgenera. The. eliminations are two species and one subspecies. The changes in nomen- 
clature are three affecting genera, two affecting subgenera, fifteen affecting species, and two 
affecting subspecies. 
The committee to whom the work was assigned by the Union consists of Messrs. Allen, 
Brewster, Coues, Merriam, and Kidgway. Mr. Ridgway acted as the committee's secre- 
tary, to whom also fell the greater part of the work of preparing the manuscript for print- 
ing. (J. A. Allen, in The Auk, April, 1889, pp. 168, 169.) 
American Ornithologists' Union. Check-List | of | North American Birds | ac- 
cording to the Canons of Nomenclature | of the | American Ornithologists' Union 
| | Abridged Edition | Revised | | Published by the American Ornitholo- 
gists' Union | 1889, 8vo., pp. 71. 

The Abridged Check-List " contains only the scientific names, English names, concordance 
and current numbers." The list of fossil birds contained in the original Check-List, how- 
ever, has been omitted, and a list of introduced or naturalized Species has been added. 
This addition of the Check-List is thus not only abridged, but revised to date. It is printed 
on only one side of the paper, thus adapting it for use in labeling, or for the reception of 
notes or additions. The preparation of the manuscript for this edition was made by Dr. 
Merriam, at the request of the committee. He also supervised the printing and compiled 
the list of " Naturalized Species," which task had been especially assigned to him by the 
committee. 
Collation of the abridged edition with the original Check-List and Supplement shows an 
almost faultless correspondence, the only discrepancies of any importance being in the 
numeration, where 420 c in the abridged edition should be 420 b, and 519 c should be 519 b. 
The "Hypothetical List," however, has been renumbered, there having been here oue 
elimination and two additions. (J. A. Allen, in The Auk, April, 1889, p. 169.)

this genus with Pseudotrionyx in a separate family.

Charles Wickliffe Beckham. Observations on tbe Birds of Southwestern Texas. 
J'roc. V. S. Nat. Mas., x, September 19, 1888, pp. 633-696. 

In this posthumous paper of over sixty pages the late Mr. Beckham has recorded his observa- 
tions on the birds observed by him during December, 1886, and January, February, and 
March, 1S87, in Bexar, B?e, and Nueces Counties, Texas. The list includes 283 species, of 
•which 22G were found in Bexar Countv. All are copiously annotated. In the first eleven 
pages he reviews the work of his predecessors in the same field, comparing their results 
with his own, and also describing the topographic and floral features of the region under 
consideration. He says : "At first it was my purpose to record only the results of my own 
observations, but upon reflection it seemed better to embody the notes of the other observ-

era who had colleoted in the same localities, and thns present a pretty fair picture of the 
avifauna along what I believe i" be an important line of fanual inosculation if such a term 
be permissible." He thus quotes frequently from the observations of Dr. 11. B. Batcher, 
Messrs. H. E. Dresser, N. C. Brown, G. B. Sennett, Dr. J. C. Merrill, and J. L. Hancock, whose 
papers arc cited in the " Bibliography," with which the paper closes. He has thus not 
only added much original matter, but condensed in convenient form the scattered records 
of previous observers. Under Oolinus virginianus texanus (p. 655) ho gives at length his 
reasons for believing that O. graysoni will be found to intergrade with this form as well as 
with 0. riibjwayi. At page 686 he notes his interesting experience with the ran- Golden- 
cheeked Warbler (Dendroioa chrysoparia), and lias many pleasant biographical notes on 
many of the lesser known species. This, it is sad to recall, was nearly Mr. Beckham's last 
work in ornithology, his death occurring even before the publication of the present paper

In this paper about 470 species and varieties collected by the Blake are enumerated, discussed, 
and described, or compared with others obtained by the U. S. Fish Commission from the 
same region. Three hundred and eighty-five species and varieties and 30 genera, sub- 
genera, or sections aro treated as new. A large amount of new information in regard to 
the anatomical characters of the Mollusks referred to is contained in the report, together 
with the revision of the synonymy of many of the species of the coasts of the United 
States. 
Perhaps the most interesting data are thoso relating to the anatomy of Plcurotomaria ,■ of the 
bivalves belonging to the families Poromyidce, Dimyidce, Verticordiidce, and Cuspidariida-, 
together witli the description of recent genera like Conomitra. Dolophanes, Mesosioma, 
Diastoma, Mesorhytis, and Dolichotoma, hitherto known only as Tertiary fossils. The i lu- 
cidation of the characters of the animal in Aurinia, Scutellina, Capulus, Turcicvla, etc., 
and the determination of the presence of a verge in many lihiphidoglossa is also an 
addition to knowledge of much interest.

defends this class against such attacks and the service against indiscriminate charges of

This paper was read by invitation before the National Academy of Sciences, at the U. S. 
National Museum. April 20, 1888. It. deals chiefly with the results of Prof. William M. 
Fontaine's researches in this field, summarizing the data contained in his unpublished 
Monograph of the Flora of the Potomac Formation and specially emphasizing the fact 
that the flora contains a huge proportion of Jurassic types, and that its dicotyledonous 
forms are very archaic in character, constituting, in all probability, their earliest recorded 
appearance. It is maintained that, owing to this peculiar character, they do not neces- 
sarily prove that the Potomac Formation is Cretaceous.

The Historical American, I, Cleveland, Ohio, August, 1888, pp. 85-92, with portrait as frontis- 
piece to magazine. 

This paper was read at the Gray memorial meeting of the botanical section of the Biological 
Society of Wahington, April 5, 1888. It gives an historical account of Dr. Gray's early 
and sustained relations with Charles Darwin, his instrumentality in furthering the spread 
of his views, the nature of his acceptance of those views, and tho manner in wbicb, as a 
botanist, Dr. Gray has been able to utilize Darwinian principles as a working basis in his 
department of science.

The Forum, New York, VI, November, 1888, pp. 2G6-275. 

It is maintained in this article that the female sex is primary and the male secondary in 
organic economy; that woman represents the principle of heredity, and that acquired 
qualities in woman are more regularly transmitted than in men. The alleged superiority 
of the males of animals is shown to be apparent only, and confined to some higher types, 
acquired chiefly through the operation of sexual selection. The conclusion is drawn that 
" the elevation of woman is the only sure road to the evolution of man."

A notice of an article by Mr. C. I). "White entitled: Carboniferous Glaciation in the Southern 

and Eastern Hemispheres, with some notes on the Glossopteria flora. 
Attention is specially called to the importance of the view expressed in Mr. White's article 
that the Glossopteria flora, though MesozoiC in aspect, is probably Permian in ago and is 
the true ancestor of the widespread Kinetic and Jurassic floras of the northern hemisphere) 
and was developed in reponse to the gradual lowering of the temperature at the period, 
replacing the true Carboniferous types which could not survive the change, and subse- 
quently migrating northward on the return of the tropical climate to reappear at many 
points as a distinctive Mesozoic flora.

The purpo. e of this book appears to be to enlighten the public, especially the farming commu- 
nities in Pennsylvania, in regard to the birds that are to be found in the State, to awaken 
a desire for their protection upon economic grounds, and to stir up an interest in natural 
history among the people. 
"The Report was printed by direction of the legislature of Pennsylvania for gratuitous dis- 
tribution in the State, and the demand so far exceeded the supply that the edition of 6,000 
copies was quickly exhausted, and, we are very glad to learn, the publication of a second 
edition of 10,000 copies, revised and enlarged, has been ordered. When this book has 
found its way into schools and farmhouses throughout Pennsylvania the profit to the birds, 
to the fanners, and to Ornithology that ought to result is incalculable. If other States 
would follow such a good example, it would be an important step toward lifting the cloud 
of ignorance that hangs over the rural mind upon matters of natural history."

are described: Perna excavata, Vanikoropsis suciaensis, Ammonites maclurei. 

Part 4. The Molluscan Fauna of Puget Group, pp. 49-63. The unique character of this brackish 
water fauna, together with other facts, shows that the body of water in which this deposit 
was formed was an estuary. It is a rich coal-bearing formation, but in its origin it was 
separated from any other coal-bearing strata of the Pacific Coast region. The following 

new species are described and figured : Gardium (Adacna?) .', Gyrena brevidens, Corbi- 

cula willisi, C.pugelensis, Batissa newberryi, B. dubia, Psammobia obscura, Sanguinolaria ? 
caudata, Teredo pugetensis, Neritina f Cerithium .' 

Part 5. Mesozoic Mollusca from the southern coast of the Alaskan Peninsula, pp. 65-70. The 
fossils described in this article are from tho shores of Kialagvic, or Wraugell Bay, on the 
southern side of the Alaskan Peninsula. They are certainly Mesozoic and seem to indicate 
that they come from a formation somewhat earlier than the Cretaceous. The following 
new species are described and figured: Gueullica increbescens, Glycimeris ' dulli, Belem- 

nites .' Belemnites —? Ammonites (Lillia) howelli, A. (Lillia) kialagvikensis, A.

PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY IN THE 

U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



By George P. Merrill, Curator. 



INTRODUCTORY. 

The history of the National Museum may be said to date from the 
year 1840, when, by act of Congress, the custody of the "National 
Cabinet of Curiosities" at that time deposited in the Patent Office 
Building- was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. This act pro- 
vided that "all objects of art and foreigu and curious research, and 
all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical 
specimens belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States," and 
which were then in the city of Washington, should be delivered to the 
Eegents of the Smithsonian Institution, and together with new speci- 
mens obtained by exchange, donation, or otherwise, should be so ar- 
ranged and classified as best to facilitate their examination and study. 
By a subsequent act* the National Museum became the authorized 
place of deposit for all objects of natural history, mineralogy, geology, 
archaeology, ethnology, etc., belonging to the United States or collected 
by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological Survey, or by any 
other parties for the Government of the United States when no longer 
needed for investigations in progress.f 

The amount of geological material which was thus brought together 
prior to 1876 was small and extremely varied. It consisted mainly of 
the collections made by Prof. J. D. Dana and his associates during 
the Wilkes Exploring Expedition in 1838-'42; by Professors Newberry 
ami Blake during the Pacific Railroads surveys in 1854-'55 ; by the 
surveys west of the one hundredth meridian under the direction of the 
Engineer Corps of the Army, and theU. S. Geological Survey under 
direction of Dr. F. V. Hay den. There were, besides, various small col-

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 






lections, including a series of 300 specimens of typical European rocks i 
and minerals obtained in 1864 from Louis Saeman in Paris ; a similar I 
series of 148 specimens received from the Royal Mining School of Frei- 
berg, Saxony ; another small series collected by H. Engleman in Mon- j 
tana, and still others collected by Dr. B. Powell from the vicinity of j 
Hot Springs, Arkansas, by D. D. Owen in Wisconsin and Minnesota, 
and other miscellaneous materials from scattering localities.* 

The Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876 afforded Professor ! 
Baird the desired opportunity for procuring a large amount of material 
illustrating the mineral resources of the United States, and laying the j 
foundation for the department of geology as it now exists. After the 
close of the exposition this material, prepared under the immediate 
supervision of Prof. W. P. Blake, together with the extensive collec- 
tions donated by foreign governments, was stored in boxes for several 
years, awaiting the completion of the new building. This was finally 
effected in the summer of 1881, and, with the appointment of Dr. George 
W. Hawes as curator the year previous, may properly be said to begin 
the history of the geological department of the National Museum. 

At the time Dr. Hawes entered upon his duties as curator he also 
assumed charge of that branch of the Tenth Census relating to the 
quarrying industry of the United States. To this work he gave almost 
his entire attention, and the present collection of building and orna- 
mental stones is largely the outgrowth of his exertions in this direction. 
Dr„ Hawes's connection with the Museum was, however, too short to 
allow the department to become fully organized, and at the time of his 
death t matters were still in a state of great confusion, owing to the 
large amount of material that had accumulated and the extent of the 
work undertaken, but necessarily uncompleted. The extensive collec- 
tions received from Philadelphia at the close of the Centennial Exhibi- 
tion in 1876, above referred to, were still unpacked and unassorted, 
as were also those received from the various United States geological 
surveys that existed prior to the present organization. 

* Prior to 1873 there were no paid, assistants whose duty it was to look after these 
collections, and it is fair to assume they suffered accordingly. Up to this time it had 
heen the custom to send all duplicate materials to Professors Newherry and Eglestou 
at Columbia College, New York City, where they were made up into sets for distri- 
bution to various institutions. Some '22,000 specimens are reported as having been 
sent out in this way. Iu 1873 Mr. F. P. Endlich was appointed assistant in charge 
of the mineralogieal collections, and continued to serve until 1879. Up to the close 
of 1879 the total number of duplicate specimens sent out was as follows:

PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 3 

To the Centennial Exhibition of 1870, the Tenth Census (1880), and 
tbe various United States geological surveys and exploring expeditions 
the department is largely indebted for whatever material it possessed 
prior to 1882. The time since the death of Dr. Hawes and the organ- 
ization of tbe three departments of mineralogy, metallurgy, and lithol- 
ogy and physical geology from the one department of geology as it 
then existed, and the very recent ^consolidation of the departments of 
metallurgy? and lithology and physical geology into the one depart- 
ment of geology has been too short lor the complete elaboration of the 
plan here proposed.* 

In the division of the various collections comprised under the head of 
geology in its broadest sense, as given below, regard has been had 
mainly to convenience in administration and arrangement of material 
in a manner most readily accessible for study and reference. We thus 
have for our main divisions as below : 

Geolo^v .. .. * Plj y sical aml Chemical Geology. 

< Pahi'ontological Geology. 

These are then subdivided as below : 

f Department of Minerals, F. W. Clark, U. S. 

Physical and Chemical Geology.. . \ Geological Survey, Honorary Curator. 

| Department ot Geology, George P. Merrill, Cura- 
l tor. 

Department of Tertiary and Recent Inverte- 
brate Fossils, W. H. Dall, U. S. Geological 
Survey, Honorary Curator. 

Department of Cretaceous Invertebrate Fossils, 
C. A. White, U. S. Geological Survey, Hono- 
rary Curator. 

Department of Paleozoic Invertebrate Fos- 
sils, C. D. Walcott, U. S. Geological Survey, 
Honorary Curator. 

Department of Vertebrate Fossils, Prof. O. C. 
Marsh, New Haven, Connecticut, Honorary 
Curator. 

Department of Fossil Plants, L. F. Ward, II. S. 
Geological Survey, Honorary Curator. 

The palreontological section as given may strike one at first thought 
as cut up unnecessarily, as cumbersome from the very multiplicity of 
its divisions. Such an arrangement has at least the advantage that 
each curator is afforded complete control of such material as he is es- 
pecially interested in, and is not hampered with the care of a great 
amount of other matter; whatever may be the effect of such diffuseness 
upon the Museum as a place of exhibition, there can be little doubt re- 
garding its benefits to the specialist. 

Of the seven divisions mentioned above this paper has to do only with 
the second, that designated simply as the department of geology, and of 
which the writer is at present acting as curator. 

In administering upon such a department one is at the very outset

4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

confronted with the old 'question as to whether the energies of the 
officers are to be directed toward getting together a systematic series 
of specimens arranged for study alone, or a show collection arranged 
behind glazed doors and properly labeled for the instruction and edifi- 
cation of the general public. This is a question that has been discussed 
since museums began, and is perhaps now no nearer settlement than 
ever. I find the specialist almost wholly inclined to the first view, and 
willingly acknowledge that were I working for merely my own gratifi- 
cation should adopt that plan. 

It is to be doubted, however, if there exists a more thoroughly selfish 
class than that of the confirmed specialist. Looking at matters from 
the standpoint of his specialty, interested only in its advancement, and 
perhaps, in only too many instances, in his own aggrandizement, he 
demands not merely that the public contribute towards his support, but 
that they receive in return nothing but his published results, which are 
presumably intelligible to not more than one person out of every ten 
thousand the world over. 

Recognizing that not merely do the public have rights in this mat- 
ter, but guided by a far loftier ideal, that of educating the masses and 
arousing an interest in natural phenomena, it was early decided to 
strive and so arrange the collections of the Museum as to meet the 
wants of both classes. We thus have an exhibition series arranged 
and labeled for the general public, but at the same time accessible to 
the student and specialist, and also a study series stored away in draw- 
ers for the exclusive use of the latter class and to which the general 
public have no access. 

First, as to this exhibition series. The plan of treatment adopted has 
been essentially the same as that given by Professor Geikie in the 
latest edition of his Text Book of Geology.* This not merely on account 
of the general excellence of the work, but because of the fact that it 
seemed best to conform, so far as possible, to some authoritative work 
that is accessible to the public. 

In following out this plan the idea advanced by Assistant Secretary 
Goode in his annual report for 18S1, that a museum should consist of 
a collection of labels illustrated by specimens has been ever kept in 
mind. Otherwise expressed, I have striven to build up the exhibition 
scries on the plan of a profusely illustrated text-book in which the speci- 
mens themselves form the illustrations and the text is furnished by the 
labels. 

No object has been intentionally exhibited merely on account of its 
beauty, rarity, or as a curiosity, a method of treatment which may well 
be relegated to the dime museums and cabinets of the relic hunters. 
Each, intended to illustrate some special point, forms a part of a more 
or less extended series tending toward the elucidation of the earth's 
structure and history.

OUTLINE. 

SECTION A. — SYSTEMATIC GEOLOGY. 

Considering geology not merely as a science treating of the compo- 
sition and structure of the earth, but as one which comprises as well 
its origin and history, one whose aim it is to " trace the progress of our 
planet from the beginning of its separate existence through its various 
stages of growth down to the present condition of things," the section 
begins with a consideration of: 

I. THE EARTH IN ITS COSMICAL ASPECT. 

In this first primary division the earth is represented as a planet and 
compared with other members of the solar system. This is, of course, 
done only by means of models and illustrations of various kinds. 

II. THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH— GEOLOGY. 

This second primary division, which comprises the science of geology 
as ordinarily understood, is divided into four subsections, each of which 
is capable of further subdivision. These subsections are : 
I. Geognosy: A consideration of the materials of the earth's sub- 
stance. 
II. Dynamical and Physiographical Geology : The agencies and meth- 
ods of geological change. 

III. Structural Geology: The architecture of the. earfch'a crust. 

IV. Stratigraphic or Historical Geology. 

SECTION B. — ECONOMIC GEOLOGY. 

This section treats the subject from a purely economic standpoint, 
and iu it are exhibited only such substances as are of value either in 
their natural condition or on account of the useful materials they may 
be made to yield. It is divided into two subsections, viz : 
I. The Geographic Series. 
II. The Systematic Series. 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 



SECTION A.— SYSTEMATIC GEOLOGY, 

I. — GEOGNOSY: A CONSIDERATION OF THE MATERIALS OF THE 

EARTH'S SUBSTANCE. 

Under this section are shown : (1) the sixteen more common elements 
which, in their various combinations, are estimated to form about 99 
per cent, of the substance of the eartlrs crust; (2) the minerals 
which, resulting from these combinations, go to make up rock masses; 
and (3) the rocks themselves. All the substances required for these ex- 
hibits are of such nature as to admit of their being readily utilized. Not 
even the fact that an element is a gas, both colorless and tasteless, is 
to be considered an obstacle, since a glass jar of hydrogen, though ap- 
parently empty, is, if properly labeled, as instructive as though the 
substance itself were tangible. In the collection of rock-forming 
minerals, the specimens are selected not for beauty or fine crystallo- 
graphic development, but ordinary forms, both crystalline and massive, 
are shown in all their principal varieties. The collection is divided into 
(1) primary minerals, or those which formed at the time of the consol- 
idation of the rock, and (2) secondary minerals, or those which have 
formed since its consolidation, and are due mainly to decomposition, 
hydration or solution and re-crystallization. The individual labels 
further state whether 1 he mineral is an essential or accessory constituent, 
and of what class of rocks it forms a part. 

The following shows the form of label here used : 

APATITE. 

Compositiott: Phosphate of lime. 
Crystalline System: Hexagonal. 

Common as an original constituent in granular 
limestone, syenite, gneiss, mica, and hornblendic 
schists and occasionally found in serpentine. Oc- 
curs also in slender, colorless, usually microscopic 
crystals in many igneous rocks oi all ages, such as 
granite, basalt, andesite, diorite, and diabase. 



PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 7 

More rarely it occurs massive in deposits of con- 
siderable extent and is mined for commercial 



purp 



oses. 



In the rock collection the samples are as a rule trimmed with a ham- 
mer into sizes approximately 3£ by 4£ by 1 inch, this form liavin*^ 
been found most convenient when everything- is taken into considera- 
tion. This rule is not, however, inviolable, and both size and shape are 
allowed to vary when the character of the rock necessitates or renders 
this advisable. Care is taken in all cases to procure so far as possible 
fresh and characteristic materials and that no specimen shall show 
abrasive marks from the hammer or other agencies on its exposed sur- 
face. 

Advantage has here been taken of an opportunity to bring together 
as large a series as the present facilities will allow of such rocks as 
have been the subject of the close methods of scrutiny adopted in mod- 
ern petrography. It therefore happens that certain groups are repre- 
sented in greater profusion than their geological importance seemingly 
warrants. The system of installation is, however, by no means inelas- 
tic, and when these other groups shall in their turn receive the attention 
they merit a place can readily be made for them by substitution, or 
better yet by an expansion of the entire series. 

In the arrangement of the exhibition portion of this collection the 
curator is at once confronted with one of the most unsatisfactory prob- 
lems in modern petrology, that relating to classification. The rapid 
strides which this branch of the science is now making render any 
system likely to be adopted of only provisional value, and what is 
written today may by the time it appears in print be so far out of date 
as to be more than unsatisfactory. However readily one may classify 
a series designed for study only, he is, with his exhibition series, at 
once reminded that each specimen, selected with a definite purpose in 
view, with an eye to geographical as well as geological distribution, 
must be called by a definite name, and placed in a definite position in 
the series. 

Whatever mental reservations the curator may have can not be made 
to appear on the label, nor, indeed, is it desirable that they should. 
Every teacher must long have recognized the fact that in the beginning 
no student should be confronted with all the uncertainties of any 
problem. Such a course tends only to confuse and discourage. It is 
best at first to treat of matters as apparent certainties, and when the 
student shall have sufficiently progressed the uncertainties will grad- 
ually unfold of themselves. 

So in arranging this petrographie collection the curator has, in his 
classification, indicated a simplicity which perhaps docs not actually 
exist, a system which aimed to be not so complicated as to confuse the 



8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

public, nor so simple and indefinite as to excite the contempt of the 
specialist. 

As at present arranged all the rocks forming any essential part of 
the earth's crnst are grouped under four main heads, the distinction 
being based upon their origin and structure. Each of the main divi- 
sions is again divided into groups or families, the distinction being 
based mainly upon mineral and chemical composition, structure, and 
mode of occurrence. We thus have : 

I. Aqueous rocks. — Rocks formed mainly through the agency of 
water as (a) chemical precipitates, or as (b) sedimentary beds. Having 
one or many essential constituents. In structure massive, laminated, 
or bedded, crystalline, colloidal, or fragmental ; never glassy. 

II. JEolian rocks. — Rocks formed from wind drifted materials. In 
structure irregularly bedded ; fragmental. 

III. MetamorpMc rocks. — Rocks changed from their original condi- 
tion through dynamic or chemical agencies, and which may have been 
in part of aqueous and in part of igneous origin. Having one or many 
essential constituents. In structure crystalline, bedded, schistose, or 
foliated. 

IV. Igneous rocks.— Eruptive. Rocks which have been brought up 
from below in a molten condition, and which owe their present structu- 
ral peculiarities to variations in composition and conditions of solidifi- 
cation. In structure massive, crystalline, felsitic, or glassy, or in cer- 
tain altered forms, colloidal. 

The following shows the type of labels used in this series : 

MICA SYENITE. 

Gallatin County, Montana. 38,600. 

Collected by George P. Merrill, 1886. 

MUSCOVITE-BIOTITE GRANITE with 
accessory TOPAZ and a LITHIA MICA. 

Stockschneider, in the Erz-Gebirge, Saxony. 

36,161. 
Obtained from B. Sturtz, 1884. 

PYROXENITE; Websterite. 

Near Webster, Jackson County, North Caro- 
lina. 38,832. 
Gift of H. J. Biddle, 1887. 

Quartzite [Novaculite]. 
Leigh River, Victoria, Australia. 28,321. 

Australian Centennial Commissioners, 1876. 

Note.— The inclosing a name in brackets, as [Novaculite] in the last form, indi- 
cates that such has gone out of use, or is a local or popular name of little value and 
not generally accepted. 



PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 9 

This collection is at present arranged in eight of what are known 
as standard sloping table cases, and comprises some 1,(500, specimens 
divided approximately as follows: 

Aqueous rocks 350 specimens; JEolian rocks 20 specimens; Meta- 
morphic rocks 300 specimens, and Igneous rocks 930 specimens. For 
further details regarding classification, kinds, and localities represented 
reference must be made to the handbook and catalogue of this exhibit 
as it will appear in the Report of the U. S. National Museum for 1890. 

This petrographic collection it has been found advisable to precede 
by four small exhibits illustrative of (1) structural features, (2) color 
variations and their causes, (3) specific gravities as influenced by com- 
position and structure, and (4) the variations in chemical composition. 

It is the object of the first, or structural series, to explain the mean- 
ing of sundry terms in common use among geologists, bnt whose exact 
meaning is not always understood by the public at large. Such a col- 
lection really forms an illustrated glossary, since the meaning of each 
term, as "porphyritic," "cellular," etc., is shown by means of a specimen 
in which the structure is the most pronounced characteristic. This col- 
lection is supplemented by a series of twelve enlarged photomicro- 
graphs showing the structure of rocks as revealed by the microscope 
and seen in polarized light. 

In preparing these transparencies, a small chip from each rock was 
ground so thin as to be transparent (from one five hundredth to one 
six hundredth of an inch), and then after being mounted between thin 
slips of glass was photographed through a microscope and between 
crossed nicol prisms. From the negatives thus prepared further en- 
largements were made by means of a solar camera, the final print being 
on glass aud twelve inches in diameter ; that is, that portion of the 
stone which is in reality about one- fourth of an inch in diameter, is here 
made to appear one foot in diameter. 

These illustrations were then painted by hand, the artist taking his 
colors from an examination of the section itself under the microscope. 
The colors of the various minerals are not, therefore, in all cases the 
true colors of the minerals themselves, but rather the color they assume 
when after being cut at different angles with their optic and crystallo- 
graphic axes they arc viewed by means of polarized light. Such colors 
are therefore somewhat misleading at first, but are rendered necessary for 
the purpose of identification and to bring out sharply the lines of sepa- 
ration between one mineral and another and thus show the structure 
and composition of the rock. Owing to the thinness of the section it 
would appear in ordinary light, i. e., light not polarized, nearly color- 
less or with only dark flecks and faint tinges of color here and there. 

In the second, or color series, an endeavor has been made to arrange 
the rocks in five groups, showing (1) rocks colored by carbonaceous 
matter; (2) rocks colored by free oxides of iron ; (3) rocks colored by 
the prevalence of iron rich silicates ; (I) rocks the color of which is due 



10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

in part at least to structural features and the transparency of feld- 
spatbic constituents, and (5) rocks the color of which is also in part due 
to the physical condition of the various constituents, but more particu- 
larly to a lack of carbonaceous matter, iron or other metallic oxides. To 
this series is appended another showing the changes in color due (1) to 
the bleaching of the carbonaceous matter; (2) to the leachiug out of fer- 
ruginous oxides by organic acids ; (3) to the oxidation of iron protoxide 
carbonates or sulphides ; (4) to a like change in the iron rich silicates, 
and (5) to a change in the physical condition of the constituent min- 
erals, mainly the feldspars. 

It is not necessary to here enlarge upon the third and fourth of the 
small series mentioned above, further than to say that the difference 
between the apparent and real specific gravity is rather strikingly 
shown in three contiguous glass jars each partially filled with water. 
The first contains a piece of pumiceous obsidian, which, buoyed up by 
its numerous vesicles, floats readily at the surface ; the second contains 
the same pumice, but sufficiently pulverized to admit the water into its 
vesicles. The fragments, therefore, sink to the bottom, as does the 
compact nonvesicular portion of the same obsidian in glass No. 3. This 
series is described in detail in the handbook above referred to. 

Aside from the collections described above as forming the exhibition 
series, as illustrative of the mineral aggregates forming any appreciable 
proportions of the earth's crust, there are in the department, stored 
away in the table cases, many collections, designed primarily for study 
only. These are so arranged as to be accessible to the student on ap- 
plication to the Director of the Museum and on presentation of proper 
credentials, if such be deemed necessary. The collections thus stored 
are classed under the head of the study series. In preparing and 
arranging this series it may be well to state that it is made up largely 
of such materials as have somewhere and at some time been subject 
to investigation. Each specimen, after trimming to a size approxi- 
mating 3 by 4 by 1 inch, has a number painted on it in oil colors, and 
which refers to a written catalogue, in which is given whatever de- 
tailed information regarding its source aud nature may be in posses- 
sion of the department. They are then placed in pasteboard trays, 
accompanied by written labels containing the same information as 
given in the catalogue, and placed in the drawers of the table cases. 
Material which is designed for the study series is, if of a miscellaneous 
nature, distributed through the collections in a systematic manner, cor- 
responding to that adopted for the exhibition series. Collections which, 
like those from Leadville and the Eureka District, to be noted later, 
represent systematic work upon rocks of a definite area, or which have 
been studied as a group for the elucidation of some particular problem, 
are kept intact, in order to best serve the purposes of the investigator. 
Characteristic rocks have in some cases been selected from these col- 
lections for exhibition purposes, but the individuality of the collection 



PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 11 

is in no case allowed to become destroyed. The more importaut collec- 
tions in this study series are mentioned below : 

Systematic study series. — This collection comprises some three thou- 
sand specimens of miscellaneous rocks from all parts of the globe, classi- 
fied systematically as in the exhibition series. 

The Ixadville collection. — This comprises some threehundred and eighty 
eruptive, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks and ores as collected and 
studied by Messrs. S. F. Emmons and C. Whitman Cross, of the U. S. 
Geological Survey, from the vicinity of Leadville, Colorado. It is a 
representative collection of the material described by the above-named 
authorities in Monograph xn of the U. S. Geological Survey, J. W. 
Powell, Director, and entitled " Geology and Mining Industries of Lead- 
ville." A characteristic series of the rocks and ores has been selected 
out and placed upon exhibition in the section devoted to economic ge- 
ology. (Catalogue Nos. 68801-69540 inclusive.) 

The Washoe collections. — These collections represent the work done 
by G. F. Becker and colleagues in the Washoe District and Comstock 
Lode, Nevada, the results of which were published in Monograph in of 
the II. S. Geological Survey, entitled " The Geology of the Comstock 
Lode." They have also been the subject of investigation by Messrs. 
Hague andlddings of the Geological Survey, whose results are embod- 
ied in Bulletin No. 7, IT. S. Geological Survey, 1885, entitled "The De- 
velopment of Crystallization in the Iugeous Rocks of Washoe, Nevada." 
The collection is in part duplicated. There is first a series of 198 spec- 
imens typical rocks of the region in sizes some 4 by 5 by 1 inch, and 
second, the main study series in sizes about 1£ by 1 by 1\ inches, and 
comprising 2,064 specimens. (Catalogue Nos. 24001-24198 inclusive 
and 70691-72754 inclusive.) 

The collections of the Fortieth Parallel Survey. — This comprises some 
three thousand specimens of eruptive and sedimentary rocks collected 
by members of the Fortieth Parallel Survey, under the direction of Clar- 
ence King in 1867-'73. The eruptive rocks of the series were described 
by Prof. F. Zirkel in Vol. vi (Microscopic Petrography) of the Reports 
of the U. S. Geological Explorations of the Fortieth Parallel. (Catalogue 
Nos. 20301-23398 inclusive.) 

The Ha ices collections. — These comprise some 350 specimens eruptive 
aud altered rocks representing in part the work done by Dr. Hawes in 
connection with the New Hampshire surveys as published in Part iv, 
Vol. in, of these reports. It also includes the small fragments de- 
scribed in his paper on the Albany granites and their contact phenom- 
ena. (Am. Jour, of Science, 1881, xxi, p. 21-32 ; Catalogue Nos. 29628- 
29290.) 

The Pacific Slope quicksilver collections. — These comprise several hun- 
dred small specimens (mostly 4x6 c m) rocks and ores from the quick- 
silver regions of the locality above noted, as collected and described by 



12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

G. F. Becker aud colleagues in Monograph xiii of the U. S. Geological 
Survey, entitled Geology of the Quicksilver Deposits of the Pacific Slope. 

U. S. Geological Survey collections. — F. V. Hayden in charge. The 
various collections made by the surveys under the direction of F. V. 
Hayden, mainly from Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, 
Idaho, and the Yellowstone National Park. These comprise some 1,200 
hand specimens of eruptive and sedimentary rocks. Much valuable 
material is missing from these, having been lost or destroyed prior to 
1880. 

Collections from surveys west of the one hundredth meridian. — The col- 
lections made in 1871-'79 under the direction of Lieut. G. M. Wheeler, 
IT. S. Engineer Department. These comprise some 680 specimens 
which, though but little studied by modern methods, are, with those of 
the Hayden surveys, kept together for purpose ot reference. 

Pigeon Point collections. — These comprise 400 specimens, illustrating 
various contact phenomena, as occurring at Pigeon Point on the north 
shore of Lake Superior, and as described by Prof. W. S. Bayley in a 
forthcoming bulletin of the U. S. Geological Survey. 

Menominee Valley and Marquette River collections. — These comprise 
354 specimens illustrative of the dynamic metamorphism of eruptive 
rocks, as described by Dr. G. B. Williams in Bulletin No. 62, U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey. 

Alaska collections. — These comprise some 250 specimens miscellaneous 
rocks collected mainly by W. H. Dall in 1866-68. 

Missouri. — A series comprising f 114 characteristic rocks from south- 
western Missouri, as collected and described by Prof. E. Haworth. 
(Catalogue, Nos. 38628-38741, inclusive.) 

Bear Paw Mountain, Montana. — A small series of eruptive, metamor- 
phic, aud drift rocks from the Bear Paw Mountains, collected by Dr. A. 
C. White and J. B. Marcou in 1883. (Catalogue, Nos. 28666-28743, inclu- 
sive.) 

St. Gothard Tunnel. — A series of metamorphic rocks, comprising some 
80 specimens received from the Swiss commissioner to the Centeunial 
Exposition at -Philadelphia in 1876. (Catalogue, Nos. 37495-37574.) 

Commander Islands, Coast of KamtschatJca. — A small series of the 
characteristic rocks of these islands collected by Dr. L. Stejuiger in 
1882-'83. (Catalogue, Nos. 37937-37972.) 

Australian collections — A series of some 355 rocks from Victoria, 
Australia, as received from the Australian centennial commissioners 
in 1876. (Catalogue, Nos. 28121-28475.) 

Brazilian collections. — An interesting series of 269 specimens of erup- 
tive and metamorphic rocks received from the governmental geologist, 
O. A. Derby. (Catalogue, Nos. 69759-70027.) 

To the extent that facilities have permitted, thin sections for micro- 
scopic study have beeu prepared from the rocks of both the exhibition 
and study collections. At the date of writing the number of these 
slides amounts to some 4,000.

II. — DYNAMICAL AND PHYSIOGRAPHICAL GEOLOGY. 

Under this section are discussed tbe agencies and methods of geo- 
logical change. It is of course impossible to represent these agencies 
in actual operation, and we must confine ourselves to a display of 
results which the labels explain. In this section are placed those 
objects illustrative of (1) Plutonic or hypogene action, under which are 
included (a) volcanoes and volcanic action, (b) earthquakes, (c) secular 
upheaval aud subsidence, and (d) hypogene causes of chauges in the 
texture, structure, and composition of rocks; and (2) epi gene or surface 
action as illustrated by the destructive and constructive or reproduc- 
tive action of the atmosphere, water, and life iu its various forms. 

(1) Plutonic or hypogene action (Geikie, pp. 178-294). — Volcanoes and 
volcanic action are illustrated by a small (2 feet 4£ inches square) model 
of Vesuvius and Monte Somma, Italy, and which is accompanied by a 
collection illustrating the character of the ejectamenta. This includes 
the lavas of 1631, 1760, 1855, and 1872; ejected and altered blocks of 
limestone (73965, 72966, 72968, and 72969); ashes, sand, and dust, in- 
cluding the pumiceous materials such as overwhelmed Pompeii (73149); 
decomposed ash from the crater of 1872 (72988) ; lapilli from the cone 
of 1880 ; hematite with chlorides of iron, copper, potash soda, magnesia 
(72993) ; cupriferous sylvite (73032) ; sulphur and other sublimation or 
solution products. Under this head is also exhibited a fine example of 
the siliceous cones built up by the geysers of the Yellowstone National 
Park (35590) ; the calcareous cones sometimes formed by hot springs 
(10809), and a diminutive cone of a mud volcano from the same region 
(12879). The varying character of volcanic ejectamenta is shown by a 
remarkably fine series of basaltic lavas iu large specimens from the 
now extinct volcanoes of Ice Spring Buttes, Utah (35371-35371), aud 
the Hawaian Islands (35849-35851), including a cake of lava dipped by 
Dr. Judd from the crater of Lua Pele (12823) ; and by acid compact and 
pumiceous glassy lavas (obsidians) from Mexico (35780) and the Mono 
craters, California (29630 to 29631). 

There are also numerous smaller specimens from Vesuvius and other 
active volcanoes. The fragmental material ejected (Geikie, p. 186) is 
illustrated by ashes and sand ejected in 1883 from the volcano on Bo- 
gosloff Island (37034); by pumice dusts which, when blown from the 
vent, are often drifted long distances by the winds (37207) ; lapilli, such 
as frequently make up the volcanic cones (35538), and quite a series 
of bombs, including specimens from the Auvergne (39130); the Eifel 
(38755); Brazil (69988); the Hawaian Islands (7056S); a pumiceous 
bomb from Vulcauo on the island of Lipari exhibiting the so-called 
bread-crust structure (73163); a large flattened bomb picked up one- 
half mile from the crater at Ice Spring Butte (35373); a typically elon- 
gate globular-shaped bomb from Mount Trumbull in Arizona (70586), 
and two peculiar basaltic bombs with large angular inclosures of grau- 
ular olivine (70585) from the same region. The exhibit is supple-

inented by a series of photographs of the extinct volcanoes about Mono 
Lake, California, as taken by Mr. I. C. Eussell (70320-70328). 

The non-volcanic igneous injections lend themselves less readily to 
exhibition purposes owing to the size of the materials. Among the 
more interesting objects now displayed are the basic trapdikes cutting 
coarse granite from Auburn and Norway, Maine (35964 and 35520), and 
the small kersahtite dikes cutting crystalline limestone from Franklin 
Furnace, New Jersey (39041). The character of the material thus 
formed may be best comprehended by reference to the specimens in 
the rock collection proper. 

The subjects of earthquakes and secular upheaval and denression can 
bo treated only by means of models aud illustrations. The scheme has 
not as yet been worked out in detail. 

HYPOGENK CAUSES OF CHANGES IN THE TEXTURE, STRUCTURE, AND COMPOSITION 

OF ROCKS. 

(1) The effects of heat. — Among the more interesting and instructive 
objects here exhibited attention may be called to the series illustrating 
what is known as contact metamorphism, i. e., rocks which have been 
changed or metamorphosed from their original condition by the heat 
and the incident chemical action of intruded igneous rocks. This series 
at present includes limestone in contact with a dike rock (39042) and 
rendered white and coarsely crystalline thereby; clay changed to por- 
celainite or porcelain jasper (3809) ; chalk rendered hard and almost vitre- 
ous by the same agencies (39121); an argillite indurated and changed 
to a bright red through the heat of burning beds of lignite (70675) ; 
and a considerable series of sedimentary rock from various European 
localities (principally the Vosges and Harz Mountains) which have been 
altered to the condition known as fruchtschiefers, knotenshiefers, horn- 
stones, spilosites, etc. (See Geikie, pp. 564 and 565.) The dike of ker. 
santite in contact with zinc ore from Franklin Furnace, New Jersey 
(39105), is peculiarly instructive, the heat having been sufficient to fuse 
the ore at point of contact. In specimens 35932 and 35933 are shown 
argillites from Nahant, Massachusetts, which have developed in them 
greenish oval spots due to incipient crystallization caused by the pro- 
trusion of a large mass of trap rock (diabase) shown in specimen 35931. 
Specimen 36767, from near Deckertown, New Jersey, is a shale indu- 
rated and banded by the intrusion of a large mass of uepheline syenite 
in the vicinity. 

(2) The effects of compression, tension, and fracture. — A record of the 
movements which have taken place in the earth's crust is kept by means 
of the folds and faults developed. It is obviously impossible to show 
these forces in actual operation, but something of their character and 
force may be learned from an examination of the few specimens here 
exhibited. The first to be noticed is a wax model made and presented 
by Mr. Bailey Willis, of the XL S. Geological Survey (73180). Layers* 



PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 15 

of wax of different colors and consistency were first laid horizontally 
on a board and weighted down by means of bird shot placed on the top. 
Pressure was then applied from the direction of the two ends (the right 
and the left) when the mass passed through the various stages shown 
in the photographs and finally assumed the shape in which it is now 
exhibited. 

Although a mass of rock may seem to us firm and unyieldiug, it is 
nevertheless susceptible of undergoing just such a crumpling and fold- 
ing as has this wax model through the long continued compressive and 
shearing force which from time to time has manifested itself in various 
parts of the earth's crust. A few examples of such folds and crumplings 
or contortions are here shown, and a larger, more varied series may be 
found under the head of structural geology. Attention may be called 
to the contorted gneisses from Brandon, Vermont (39818) ; Sherburne 
Falls, Massachusetts (38124); Stony Point, New York (38746), and 
Norway (70422). 

Such a force does not always,- result, however, in the production of 
folds, but as is now well known may be productive of a foliated or 
schistose structure. 

Interesting examples of such results are shown in a series of specimens 
from Slatington, Pennsylvania (70104-70107 and 702G6-70267). To 
fully appreciate this exhibit it must be remembered that the slates were 
originally formed as fine sediments laid down on a sea bottom, and that 
the cleavage whereby they split up readily into thin sheets is due 
wholly to subsequent pressure (see Geikie, p. 288) and is in no way con- 
nected with the bedding which may cross it at any and all angles. In 
the specimens the bedding is indicated by the dark bands and the 
cleavage is plainly shown cutting across it. 

In certain of the samples the material of these dark bands seems to 
have lent itself less readily to the compressive force, and may be ob- 
served to have puckered (specimens 70104 and 70105) or even to have 
broken and faulted repeatedly, as in the block No. 702G6. 

All rocks are not equally tough or elastic, and as may readily be 
imagined do not always show similar effects under the action of the 
same forces. Many brittle rocks are shattered into innumerable frag 
ments under a shock or such pressure as would be productive of far less 
striking results on tougher materials. This shattering effect is shown 
in the collections by the polished slabs of limestone breccia from Algeria 
(G9574). The fragments in this case have been reunited by the cement- 
ing action of infiltrating water carrying lime and iron oxides in solution 
and form thus our richest and most prized marbles. 

Other interesting indications of great pressure and strain are shown 
in a series of indented and crushed pebbles. The large quartz pebble 
from Silesia (13048) is peculiarly interesting, having been broken re- 
peatedly in two directions and one portion pushed over the other for a 
distance of a centimetre or more. Yet the parts have so firmly reunited 



16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

that the pebble is today apparently as strong as ever. Still other 
effects of pressure and shearing are shown in the broken trap-dikes and 
veins of serpentine in the crystalline limestone of Smithfield, Khode 
Island (69560-69572), and the foliated structure of certain gneisses. 

The phenomena of jointing, produced by a sharp shock or an abrupt 
fold, is illustrated on a small scale by a specimen of gneiss from Cape 
Elizabeth, Maine, in which the rock is divided at intervals of a few 
inches by rifts as sharp as though made by a lapidary's wheel. Other 
peculiar forms of jointing are shown in shale from Cambridge, Massa- 
chusetts (70590), and slates from Carlton County, Minnesota (26488). 
Joints in igneous rocks and other specimens illustrative of the phe- 
nomena on a larger scale may be found under the structural series. 
(See p. 28.) 

The movement of a mass of rock along the line of a joint gives rise 
to what is known technically as a fault. Specimens illustrative of this 
feature and suitable for exhibition purposes are as a rule difficult to ob- 
tain owing to their size. Nevertheless it occasionally happens that 
good examples may be had on a scale sufficiently small for exhibition. 
In each of the cases exhibited the amount of displacement was slight, 
and is readily determined by the bands of various color by which they 
are traversed. In these instances, as is not always the case in larger 
rock masses, the faulted blocks have become reunited so firmly that the 
fault would scarcely be suspected but for the fact that the color bands 
are no longer continuous. (Specimens 72869 from Montana and 20809 
from Nevada.) 

The slipping of one mass of rock over another along a line of fault 
give rise to smooth and striated, often highly polished surfaces known 
as slickensides. These are shown on massive magnetite from New 
York State (37039) ; anthracite coal from Pennsylvania (70660) ; and 
the wall rock of silver mines in the Keese Eiver district Nevada (31638). 

(3) The metamorphism of rocks. — The subjects of the metamorphism 
of rocks by the heat of injected volcanic masses has already been 
touched upon (p. 14), as has also that form of change produced by move- 
ments in the earth's crust and resulting in a schistose foliated or brec- 
ciated structure (p. 15). There is one other form of change, however, 
which can perhaps be best illustrated here. This is the change known 
as mgtasomatosis, a process of indefinite substitution and replacement. 
The details of this process are admirably shown in the series illustrat- 
ing the origin of serpeutinous rocks. 

Serpentine, it should be remembered, is essentially a hydrous silicate 
of magnesia, consisting, when pure, of nearly equal proportions of 
silica and magnesia with from 12 to 13 per cent, of water. The massive 
varieties occurring in nature are, however, always more or less impure, 
containing frequently from 10 to 12 per cent, of iron oxides, together 
with varying quantities of chrome iron (chromite), iron pyrites, horn- 
blende, olivine, minerals of the pyroxene group, and the carbonates of 
lime and magnesia. 



PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 17 

The, reason for this great diversity in composition lies mainly in the 
fact that the serpentine rarely if ever occurs as an original deposit, but 
is always secondary, a product of alteration of either eruptive or sedi« 
mentary rocks rich in such magnesian minerals as olivine and the non- 
aluminous pyroxenes. As, however, these rocks rarely consist of pure 
magnesian silicates, but carry in addition lime, alumina, and various 
metallic oxides, these constituents separate out during the process of 
change, and recrystallize in veins, streaks, and blotches ascalcite, dolo- 
mite, magnetite, etc., thus producing the common variations in color. 

The theory long ably advocated by Dr. Hunt to the effect that the 
serpentine occurring intercalated with beds of schistose rocks and 
limestones resulted from metamorphism of silico-magnesian sediments 
deposited by sea waters is now very generally abandoned, and it is 
doubtful if the substance ever occurs as an original deposit even in the 
eozoonal forms. 1 

The following analyses will serve to illustrate the change in compo- 
sition which takes place in the conversion of (i) olivine and (n) py- 
roxene iuto serpentine.

Montville, New Jersey ; (d) serpentine derived from the same, aud (in) the theo- 
retical composition of serpentine. 

This change, it will be observed, is, in the case of the olivine, simply 
a process of hydration — an assumption of some 13 per cent, of water. 
In the pyroxene the process is more complex and consists of a loss in 
silica, of all the lime which crystallizes out as calcite, and an assumption 
of nearly 14 per cent, of water. 

In the series exhibited the derivation of serpentine from a pyroxene, 
as indicated in analysis n above, is admirably shown by the suite of 
specimens from Montville, New Jersey. In the large mass placed out- 
side the case the gray core of pyroxene may be observed covered with 
a thin crust of serpentine aud traversed by large and small veins of the

same substance, the process having been arrested before completion. 
The same condition of .affairs is shown in the smaller specimens num- 
bered 39038, 39101, 39110, and 69195 in the case, several of these having 
been cut and polished to better show the various stages. In many 
instances the calcium set free has crystallized out by itself in the form 
of calcite of a blue gray tint. The exteriors of many of the nodules, it 
will be observed, are grooved and striated like glacial bowlders owing 
to expansion and consequent crowding in the process of hydration. 
(See original paper "On the Serpentine of Montville, New Jersey," in 
the bound pamphlets on the table.) Serpentine after pyroxene is also 
admirably shown in the large polished block from Thurman, Warren 
County, New York. 

Serpentine after tremolite is shown in specimens 70131, from New 
York, and in specimens 70114, 70115, 70119, 70121, and 70122, from 
Easton, Pennsylvania. The least changed rock is shown in specimen 
70L22, and the different stages of the alteration are indicated in gradual 
change in color from light gray, nearly white, to greenish colors. 

Serpentine after a peridoti.te is shown in specimen 70137 from the 
Lizard, Cornwall, England, and in the deep, bright green rock from near 
Texas, Pennsylvania (701G0). Serpentine after pyroxenite is shown in 
specimens 38478 and 38471 fron* Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, 
the first mentioned being the fresh enstatite rock, while the last is the 
impure serpeutiuous product to which it gives rise. Serpentine after 
pyroxeue and replacing calcite, giving rise to the mixed serpentine, cal- 
cite, and dolomite rock, ophiolite, is shown in specimens 70082 to 70084 
from Moriah, Essex County, New York. 

From Plutonic or hypogeue, we pass to (n) Surface or epigene action, 
in which section are displayed materials illustrative of the destructive, 
constructive, and reproductive effects of the atmosphere, of surface 
water, and of life in its various forms (Geikie p. 301 et seq.) 

AIR. 

Pure dry air, as stated by Professor Geikie, has but little effect upon 
rock masses, and it is only through the aid of dissolved moisture and 
temperature variations that its efficacy as a geological agent becomes 
apparent. Nevertheless, there are certain phenomena which, although 
it may be of slight geological importance, are sufficiently interesting to 
fiud a place here. 

Effects of lightning. — Under this head are exhibited an interesting 
and instructive series of fulgurites or lightning tubes. Specimens of 
tubular form like those from Illinois (35905), New Jersey (39313), South 
Caroliua (37414), Florida (38312 and 73263), and Maldonado, South 
America (38852), are formed by the lightning striking in loose sand, 
the heat of the flash being sufficient to fuse the sand, and thus form on 
cooling the frail glassy tubes shown in the specimens. When lightning 
strikes on solid rock the more common result is a mere superficial 



PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OP GEOLOGY. 19 

fusion, although occasional holes of slight depth are formed, as shown 
in specimens from Oregon and Armenia.* A more complete descrip- 
tion of these may be fouud in the bound volume of pamphlets on the 
tablet 

Effects of temperature variations. — As is well known, the usual effects 
of heat upon any material substance is that of expansion, and of cold 
contraction. In countries like the arid regions of the West the alterna- 
tions of heat and cold are often so great as to produce very marked 
disintegration and exfoliation even in the toughest and most solid of 
rocks. The results of such disintegration are not of such a nature as 
to lend themselves readily to exhibition purposes. In the specimen 
shown (a compact andesite from Madison County, Montana), the entire 
mass of rock has on the surface become by these temperature varia- 
tions broken into blocks of but a few pounds' weight each, and the sur- 
face of the ground on the neighboring slopes is everywhere covered 
with small chips thus flaked off with beautiful concave and convex sur- 
faces, as may be observed in the specimen. The high plateaus and 
mountain tops in this region are invariably covered by loose debris in 
the form of thin sheets of but a few inches or many feet in diameter 
which have been thus flaked off. 

The effects of wind. — The geological action of the wind is due mainly 
to (1) its efficacy as a transporting agent, and (2) to the abrasive effects 
of the transported substances. Its efficacy as a transporting agent 
can be shown only by an exhibition of the material transported aud by 
photographs. 

Of chief interest in this exhibit are the fine volcauic dusts, such as, 
after being ejected from the volcanic throat, are drifted by winds, it 
may be for many miles. Specimen 35800 was gathered at Tryssil, on 
the coast of Norway, in November, 1875, having been blown by the 
wind from Iceland. No. 36974 is a product of the eruption of Krakatoa 
in 1883. This dust fell at the rate of an inch an hour on board the 
ship Beaconsjield while at a distance of 800 miles from its source. No. 
38588 is from a bed not less than 6 feet in thickness, and which occu- 
pies the bed of a now extinct lake in Gallatin County, Monanta. The 
photograph shows the thickness and position of this bed. Other 
samples shown are from similar beds in Nebraska (37023, 37024, and 
38545) and Nevada (77200). Of the coarser materials thus drifted atten- 
tion ma} 7 be called to the gypseous sand from near Fillmore, Utah. 
This, as described by Geologist Gilbert, is first formed as minute crys- 
tals on evaporation of the water of playa lakes. Subsequently the winds 
sweeping across the dry lake beds gather the sand into drifts. 

The siliceous and calcareous sands in arid regions or along sea and 
lake shores are often thus blown into huge drifts or dunes, which them-

selves travel slowly across the country, burying everything which hap- 
pens in their path. The shell sand shown in specimens 20255 and 20256 
from the island of Bermuda is thus blown up from the shore, and like 
huge drifts of snow has buried garden, woodlands, and even houses. 
Photographs illustrative of the sand dunes of the Lake Michigan region 
are also here included. 

The abrasive effects of material transported by the wind is often 
manifested in a highly interesting and instructive manner. It can be 
readily understood that sand sharply blown against any stationary ob- 
ject would have a tendency to wear it slowly away, a fact which is taken 
advantage of in the artificial sandblast used in glass and stone cutting. 
In many sandy regions, and particularly those where dry winds prevail 
a considerable portion of the year, this abrasive action becomes notice- 
ably conspicuous. 

Under this head are here exhibited a small series of rocks thus carved 
and polished. The most curious of these is the conglomerate (20472) 
from Nevada, into which the natural sandblast has drilled irregular 
worm-like holes. Others of interest are the beautifully polished spec- 
imens from Montana, collected by Dr. A. 0. Peale and G. P. Merrill, 
(Nos. 38575, 70602), and also the grooved basalt and peculiarly etched 
pebbles from Arizona (Nos. 37200, 38828, and 39094), collected and de- 
scribed by G. K. Gilbert while geologist of the surveys west of Jbeone 
hundredth meridian. Here, too, is exhibited a large plate of glass from 
a light-house on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. During a heavy storm this 
became so abraded all over its exposed surface by windblown sand as 
to be no longer serviceable, and to necessitate its removal (No. 35537). 
This series is supplemented by photographs copied from Gilbert's re- 
port on the geology of the region west of the one hundredth meridian. 

WATER. 

Water as a geological agent acts both chemically and mechanically. 
The chemical processes involved are grouped by Professor Geikie (p. 
317) under the heads of (1) oxidation, (2) deoxidatiou, (3) solution, (4) 
formation of carbonates, and (5) hydration. In nature it frequently 
happens that any or all of these processes are going on at the seme 
time in a rock mass, the general result of the combined forces being 
spoken of as weathering. In the exhibits one or more typical illustra- 
tions are given of each of the processes working alone and a larger 
series illustrative of the more complex process of weathering. 

Oxidation is illustrated by argillite (73267), in which the iron oxide 
has segregated in zones of varying color, giving the rock a beautiful 
banded structure. 

Deoxidatiou is shown by sandstone (18927) colored brown by iron 
oxides, but from which a portion of the coloriug matter has been leached 
out by organic acids.

water miming down tbe face of the cliff (703§3), and by blocks of gyp- 
sum eroded by similar means (35590). 

Many rocks show the effects of solution unequally, owing to the un- 
equal hardness and solubility of their various parts. Thus the lime- 
stone from Bear Paw Mountain, Montana (28724), is strongly ribbed by 
siliceous veins from between which the calcium carbonate has been dis- 
solved. Similar phenomena are shown in specimen No. 37035. 

The formation of carbonates is carried on in such a way as not readily 
to be shown in a series of this kind. The specimen exhibited is an 
eruptive rock in which many of the silicate minerals have undergone 
decomposition, giviug rise to an abundance of carbonate of lime or cal- 
cite. 

Hydration by itself can be best illustrated in the conversion of olivine 
into serpentine (see p. 10), and is also shown in the derivation of gypsum 
from anhydrite, but the change in appearance is, in the latter case, 
scarcely sufficiently marked to be appreciated. Hydration accom- 
panied by oxidation, whereby the entire mass of substance falls to frag- 
ments, is well shown in the py rite-bearing coals of Virginia, and hydra- 
tion accompanied by the production of carbonates by the pyroxene 
altered into serpentine. 

The general destructive effects of weathering are shown in an inter- 
esting series of fresh and decomposed grauitic rocks from the District 
of Columbia, in which may be traced all gradations from the compact 
fresh rock through specimens more or less kaolinized and oxidized to 
soft pulverulent material, upon which plants may be grown. The prin- 
cipal changes that have taken place being, aside from a physical disin- 
tegration, an assumption of water, a removal of the alkalies potash 
and soda, and a conversion of the combined iron oxides into free hydrous 
sesquioxides, whereby the rock has changed from a gray to a bright 
umber red. Other objects of like nature here displayed are residual 
clays from the Southern States, as described by Mr. I. 0. Russell in 
Bulletin No. 51 of theU. S. Geological Survey.* The exhibit is accom- 
panied by a few specimens and photographs, showing spheroidal and 
other types of weathering common to various rocks. 

Water percolating through the superficial portions of the earth's 
crust dissolves certain constituents either directly or sets up a series of 
chemical changes resulting in the production of soluble compounds 
which are gradually removed to be deposited elsewhere or perhaps 
carried down into the ocean. Nearly all spring waters are hard, owing 
to the amount of mineral matter contained by them, while rain waters 
are soft owingto the absence of all mineral matter. By the dissolving 
power of water are formed the numerous caverns so common in lime- 
stone regions. By the deposition of mineral matter held in solution 
are formed a variety of products, some of which are very beautiful.

22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889 

Among these, which may perhaps be properly grouped under the 
head of constructive and reproductive effects of water, need at present 
be mentioned the exceptionally fine series of stalactites aud stalagmites, 
mainly from the Luray Caves of Virginia; the beautiful siliceous and 
calcareous sinters from the geysers and hot springs of the Yellowstone 
Park and the peculiar imitative calcareous tufas from Lake Lahoutou, 
Nevada, as collected aud described by Mr. I. C. Russell, of the U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey. Besides these are many specimens less conspicuous for 
their size, but none the less instructive. Among them attention may be 
directed to the agates which were deposited from solution in the cav- 
ities of trap rocks. In the specimen from near South Boulder Creek, 
Montana, is shown a small agate still in the cavity which it formed. 
Other solution products are the rock salts from New Iberia, Louisiana 
(38461); Stassfurth, Germany, and the calc tufas coating leaves and 
stems of plants from Soda Springs, Idaho (39130). 

This series is supplemented by photographs of the tufa deposits 
about Mono Lake, California, and the geyser and hot spring deposits 
in the Yellowstone National Park. 

Running streams carrying fine detritus act in a mechanical as well as 
chemical manner. In this way are formed such curiously eroded forms 
as the granite bowlder from Craftsbury, Vermont, in which the finer 
grained portion has shown greater resistance than the upper coarser 
part (70099). Objects of this nature are as a rule too large for exhibi- 
tion as specimens, and recourse must be had to models and illustrations. 
Here, then, attention may be directed to the large model of the Grand 
Canon of the Colorado River, and also the ten panoramic views of the 
same placed high against the north wall of the range, as well as the 
transparencies in the windows on the south side. 

The transporting aud constructive power of running streams is at 
present indicated in the series only by a few vials showing the amount 
of mineral and organic matter contained in a litre of Potomac water 
during a season freshet. This part of the exhibit has not yet been 
worked out in detail. The transporting power of ocean currents is 
shown by a small collection of seeds cast up on the beach at Palisadoes 
Plantation, island of Jamaica, a part of which are quite foreign to the 
island, aud by fragments of pumice from the volcano of Krakatoa, but 
which were found floating on the surface of the water at a distance of 
1,315 miles from their source. There is need of more material here. 

The mechanical action of waves as displayed in the undermining aud 
breaking down of rocky cliffs can be shown only by models and illus- 
trations. A small amount of space is, however, here given to a series 
illustrating the resultant product of such action. 

The material selected comes from Cape Elizabeth, on the coast of 
Maine. The cliffs on the shore are composed of finely fissile schists 
which are traversed by numerous veins of quartz. The continual ham- 
mering of the waves from the open Atlantic causes the schist to slowly

disintegrate and fall to the foot of the cliff', often in pieces of consid- 
erable size. The quartz veins being - hardest and toughest remain intact 
until the last and often protrude some distance beyond the surface of 
the schist as shown in the large specimens No. 3903G. 

Once at the foot of the cliff the fragments are alternately thrown upon 
the beach and dragged back into the sea by each successive wave and its 
return undertow until gradually reduced to the pebble form. All 
stages in the process are shown from the angular fragment as it fell 
from the cliff to the resultant oval pebble. It will be observed that 
owing to the fissile nature of the schist its pebbles are always in the 
form of a greatly flattened oval, while those of the massive quartz are 
more nearly spherical. But of whatever character the material the 
normal shape of a beach formed bowlder or pebble is oval, and this for 
the reason that the wave action is a dragging rather than a carrying 
one; the stone is not lifted bodily and hurled toward the shore to roll 
back with the receding wave, but is rather shoved and dragged along. 
Gravity tends to hold the fragments in one position so that the wear is 
greatest on the side which is down, and this in itself would cause them 
to assume an oval or flattened form even were they spherical and of 
homogeneous material at the start. 

At the end of this series is put a sand composed of admixed coarse 
and fine fragments of shell, schist, and siliceous particles, and which 
was obtained at low tide further out from the shore. This may be re- 
gained as illustrative of the material now forming as stratified deposits 
at this point of the coast. 

Geological action of ice. — Materials illustrating the destructive effects 
of freezing water are for the time being not separated from those illus- 
trative of the general process of rock weathering. Here are grouped 
only objects relating to the phenomena of glaciation as produced by 
modern glaciers and during the glacial epoch. 

The exhibit begius with a series of photographs taken by Mr. I. C. 
Russell, of the U. S. Geological Survey, showing the existing glaciers 
on Mounts Dana and Lyell, in California, and the morainal embank- 
ments near Mono Lake (70279-70301). There are also shown scratched 
and scarred pebbles from the Dana glacier (3720G) and a sample of the 
finely pulverized rock from the foot of the glacier at head of Parker's 
Creek, near Mono Lake (37234). A similarly formed sediment is also 
shown from a glacial stream in Greenland (38856). The work of the 
ice during the glacial period is shown by grooved, polished, and striated 
stones from several localities. Among the more striking of these atten- 
tion may be called to the following: A large slab (30 by 48 inches) of 
grooved and fluted limestone from Kelley's Island, in Lake Erie (38534), 
and others from St. David's, Ontario (72833 and 72834). These are the 
slabs figured on pages 194, 195, and 214, Seventh Annual Report United 
States Geological Survey for 18S5-'8G. There is also a slab (2G by 30 
inches) from Rochester, New York, showing stria} in two directions, 



24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

and numerous smaller specimens of smoothed or scratched rocks from 
the New England States and Greenland. 

Forming a part of this series are also photographs of the glacial 
potholes at Archbald, Pennsylvania (38294), and of a large drift bowlder 
on the northern end of Deer Isle, Maine (37413). There are also smaller 
views showing fields covered with drift bowlders. 

LIFE. 

The collections illustrating the destructive effect of life in its various 
forms are at present writing sadly lacking in desirable materials. A few 
poorly selected stones bored by mollusks (No. 29644-29649) aud a fria- 
ble sandstone riddled by the holes of a hymenopterous insect (37641) 
constitute about all that is worthy of mention. The constructive effects 
are better showu by the diatomaceous earths (37429), marls (36850 and 
70034), shell limestones (35814 and 37749), chalk (36013), guano (69281), 
and the peats aud coals (36826). 

The method of formation of a coral island is in this series shown by 
a small collection illustrative of the geology of Bermuda. The exhibit 
begins with a collection of the more common corals and shells of the 
island, aud which by their disintegration have furnished the bulk of the 
materials of which the islands are composed. These include bottles 
which, having lain for two years in the water, are covered by a growth 
of millepora alcicornis, and which illustrate the rapidity of the coral 
formation. Following these are specimens of the corals and shells 
common to the neighboring waters, and the fine calcareous sand which, 
resulting from their disintegration, is thrown by the waves upon the 
beaches, dried, and drifted inland by the winds. Following these are 
the rocks which result from the consolidation of these fragmental mate- 
rials, a consolidation brought about by the dissolving action of water 
on the calcium carbonate of the shells and a redepositiou of the dis- 
solved materials at greater depths below the surface to form a cement 
binding together the grains. Following these are the soils aud residual 
clays; surface and weathered rocks illustrative of the characteristic 
roughness of the coast; stalactites and stalagmitic masses resulting 
from the deposition of dissolved lime in the numerous caverns with 
which the island abounds; the exhibit closing with a series of rocks 
foreign to the islands, but which occur occasionally as small pebbles, 
having been drifted from other sources, and presumably entangled in 
the roots of trees. For most of the materials in this collection the 
museum is indebted to Prof. William N. Rice and the late Dr. G. W. 
Hawes.

dynamical geology, in the one case illustrating the methods by which 
certain structures are brought about and in the other the structures 
themselves. The text- book arrangement has not here in all cases been 
strictly adhered to, as not being quite adapted to our purpose. 

(1) Stratification and its accompaniments. — (a) Forms of bedding: This 
department of the exhibit is at present sadly in need of suitable mate- 
rial. The few specimens at present on hand are small and poor, and 
need not therefore be further noted here. 

(b) Surface markings : These are shown in their several forms as 
below : 

Wave and ripple marks are shown in the two large slabs of Fotsdam 
quartzite from Keeseville, New York (38758), and the Devonian sand- 
stone from Pike County, Pennsylvania (27014). Several smaller slabs 
from various localities are shown in the cases. To appreciate these it 
must be remembered that the rocks were lain down in the form of fine 
sand in the shallow water of an ancient sea or ocean, and which by its 
oscillatory movement formed in the sand the ripples in the same manner 
as they may to-day be seen forming on almost any sandy lake or sea 
shore (Geikie, p. 470). Through the gradual sinking of the earth's 
crust the markings once formed became covered by other sand and thus 
preserved until thoroughly solidified, raised above sea level, and made 
available to the quarrier, all the slabs shown being obtained in the 
ordinary process of quarrying stone for building purposes. " Ripple 
marks are often made by the waves over the finer beach sands where 
they are low and partly sheltered, and also over mud flats. The flow- 
ing water pushes up the sand into a ridgelet as high as the force of the 
wave can make and then plunges over the little elevation and begins 
another, and thus the succession is produced. The height and breadth 
of the intervening space will depend on the force and velocity of the 
flowing water and the ease with which the sand or mud is moved. Rip- 
ple marks may be made by the vibration of waves at depths of 300 or 
500 feet."— (Dana.) 

Mud cracks and rain prints : Like the ripple marks the mud cracks 
denote shallow water deposits. Laid down as mud, the beds while still 
soft were exposed by the receding water and dried, cracking irregularly 
just as the tine clayey mud on the bottom of shallow pools may in any 
dry season be observed to do. Subsequently the water rose once more 
and washed fresh sand into the crevices formed. The elevated ridges 
shown on the large slab of Medina stone from Knowlesville, New York 



26 REPORT OF NAT J ON AL MUSEUM, 1889 



(72959), aud the smaller slabs from Huinmelstown, Pennsylvania (27055), 
are then but casts in sand of these old cracks (Geikie, p. 471). The 
rain prints shown on the small slabs of Triassic sandstone from New 
Jersey indicate that the stone while still plastic was exposed to the pelt- 
ing action of a shower, the drops leaving their imprint in the soft mud. 

Footprints : It has not infrequently happened that animals wading in 
the shallow water left footprints in the mud to be covered and preserved 
in the same manner as were the cracks and ripple marks above referred 
to. But few of these are shown here, since the subject belongs more 
properly to vertebrate paleontology. On the large slab pinned against 
the south wall are two consecutive tracks of the Brontozoum gigartteum 
(H), a huge reptile estimated to have been at least 14 feet in height 
aud which inhabited the Connecticut Valley during the Triassic period. 
The smaller slabs pinned high against the east wall show tracks of 
Brontozoum validhtm and SiUimanium, and Anomcepus cuneatus. Qu the 
small slab from South Hadley Falls, Massachusetts, are shown the mud 
nests of tadpoles, Batracho ides nidifict ens of Hitchcock. 

A large slab of Potsdam quartzite from New York showing faintly the 
trail of a marine mollusk (Protichnites Loganns), made as he crawled 
slowly over the soft bottom of the Cambrian ocean, serves further to 
illustrate the conditions under which these rocks were formed. 

Concretions : The peculiar tendency which atoms or particles of like 
matter often manifest in concreting or gathering in concentric layers 
about centers is shown by a large and diversified collection of concre- 
tious. As here arranged these are divided into two groups, as follows: 
(A) Primary concretions, formed contemporaneously with the rock in 
which they are found, and (B) secondary concretions, or those which 
are due to segregating processes acting subsequent to the formation of 
the rocks in which they are found. Each of the groups may be subdi- 
vided accordingly as the concretions were formed as chemical precipi- 
tates or are but aggregates of mineral particles bound together by an 
interstitial cement. 

(A.) Primary concretions : (a) chemical deposits and (b) mineral ag- 
gregates. 

Under (a) are here included the chalcedonic nodules found in lime- 
stones (specimens 38434, 38435, and 37603), the pyrite concretions, such 
as No. 39053, aud the clay ironstones, such as Nos. 12890 and 37303 ; 
these last are often found to have cracked interiorily on drying and 
consequent shrinkage, and the cracks to have become subsequently 
filled with carbonate of lime. On being cut and polished such ofteu 
form beautiful and unique objects, as shown in the specimens from 
Kansas (12890), Indiana (25100), aud New York (39129). To such forms 
the name Septarian nodule is commonly given. Here also are displayed 
the fine oolitic and pistolitic concretions such as those of Bohemia (30096 
aud 36097), Hungary (36099), Cache Valley aud Salt Lake, Utah (35305 



PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 27 

and 35379), and Lake Labontoii, Nevada (35378). Concerning the occur- 
rence of these last Mr. Russell writes:* 

"Among The Needles the rocky capes are connected by crescent-shaped beaches of 
clean, creamy sands, over which the summer surf breaks with soft murmurs. These 
sands are oolitic in structure, and are formed of concentric layers of carbonate of lime 
which is being deposited near where the warm springs rise in the shallow margin 
of the lake. In places these grains have increased by continual accretion until they 
are a quarter of an inch or more in diameter, and form gravel, or pisolite, as it would 
be termed by mineralogists. In a few localities this material has been cemented into a 
solid rock, and forms an oolitic limestone sufficiently compact to receive a polish. 
No more attractive place can be found for the bather than these secluded coves, with 
their beaches of pearl-like pebbles, or the rocky capes, washed by pellucid waters, 
that offer tempting leaps to the bold diver." 

Such forms as these may or may not show a nucleus. It seems safe 
to assume that such a nucleus at first in all cases existed, though it may 
be in microscopic dimensions only. A shell nucleus is shown in the clay 
ironstone concretion from Kansas (73454), and fragmental nuclei of 
siliceous sinter in the concretionary nodules from the geysers of the 
Yellowstone National Park (12888). 

Under (b) are shown concretions composed of mineral particles in a 
finely fragmental condition, and which have as in the last case segre- 
gated contemporaneously with the formation of the material iu which 
they occur. Here are included a series of clay concretions from the head- 
waters of the Connecticut Eiver (38425) ; from the Yellowstone Lake 
(12895) ; and from various beds of brick and potters' clay iu New Eng- 
land. In certain of these the presence of a nucleus is plainly evident, 
those from Orono, Maine (369G5), having formed about stems of grasses; 
those of Jefferson County, Tennessee (38357), about small shells.t 

The secondary concretionary forms (B) are likewise susceptible of sub- 
division on precisely similar grounds. Under the head of chemical de- 
posits would come such forms as flint nodules in chalk (3G012) and the 
agates formed in cavities in trap rock (69569). Such do not in all cases 
show a concentric structure and might perhaps be better termed secre- 
tions than concretions, and classed with mineral veins. Under the 

* Geological History of Lake Lahonton, a Quaternary Lake of Northwestern Nevada, 
Monograph XI, U. S. Geological Survey. 

* The manner in which concretions of this nature are formed was shown in a very 
interesting manner a few years ago during the process of the work of filling in the 
so-called Potomac flats, on the river front at Washington, District of Columbia. For 
tin; double purpose of raising the flats and deepening the channel gigantic pumps 
were employed which raised the sediment from the river bottom in the form of a very 
thin mud and forced it through iron pipes to the flats, where it flowed out spreading 
quietly over the surface. The material of this mud was mainly fine siliceous sand 
and clay intermingled with occasional fresh water shells and plant debris. As this 
mud flowed quietly from the mouth of the pipe and spread out over the surface the 
clayey particles began immediately to separate from the siliceous sand in the form of 
concretionary balls, and in the course of a few minutes these would grow to be several 
inches in diameter. Such, owing to tin; rapidity of their formation, contained a largo 
amount of sand and shells, though clayey matter predominated, 



28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

second head are included such forms as the sandstone concretions shown 
from Arkansas (37600) and New Jersey (38761 and 38427). These are 
due not to original deposition in concentric layers, but to the oxidizing 
and leaching action of meteoric waters acting on nodular inclusions of 
iron sulphide, or possibly carbouates. The oxide thus formed segre- 
gates in zones, and by its cementing action binds the sand grains to- 
gether leaving the central portion, formerly occupied by the pyrite, either 
empty or partially filled with loose sand ; such forms are shown intact 
and broken in halves in specimens 38427 and 37004. 

A zonal banding or shelly structure closely simulating concretionary 
structure is common in rocks more or less weathered and decomposed, 
but which is due not to original deposition or crystallization of mineral 
matter about a center, but rather to the weathering of jointed blocks, 
the various chemical and physical forces acting from without inward. 
This is here illustrated in specimen 38570 from Montana (see also under 
head of Rock- weathering). 

Still another form of concretion due to segregating forces acting 
together with pressure are shown in the so-called cone-incones (38838, 
39122, and 39175). 

(2) Joints. — Jointing on a sufficiently large scale to be appreciable as 
a structural feature of the earth's crust can well be shone only by pho- 
tographs and models. Here are exhibited a few isolated examples of 
jointing in both sedimentary and igneous rocks. Special attention may be 
called to the large basaltic column from the Yellowstone National Park. 
The exhibit is at present meager, and is supplemented by a few photo- 
graphs. Jointing in granite and illustrating its utility in quarrying is 
shown in a photograph of the Red Beach granite quarries near Calais, 
Maine (73457). Columnar jointing in volcanic rocks is shown in a pho- 
tograph of " Rooster Rocks, " on the south shore of the Columbia River 
near Portland, Oregon (73458); in a view near Mount Davidson, Cali- 
fornia (38283) ; and two views of the Regla Cascades in Mexico (38301 
and 38305). 

(3) Inclination, strike, and clip are subjects as yet scarcely touched 
upon. From necessity these phenomena can be illustrated satisfac- 
torily only by means of models and photographs. Emmons's sectional 
model of Leadville and vicinity may be referred to here. 

(4) Curvature, cleavage, and distortion are quite well illustrated in 
the series of distorted gneisses and schists shown in the cut and pol- 
ished slabs from Auburn, Maine (39059) ; Brandon, Vermont (39018) ; 
New York (39124); the roofing slates from Pennsylvania (70104-70107), 
and the crushed pebbles already referred to under the head of " Effects 
of pressure." The sharply foliated schists from Dutch Island in Narra- 
gansett Bay are also worthy of mention (38608) as well as the large slab 
of curved slate showing junction with shale (specimens 70102 and 70103 
from Pennsylvania). 

(5) Igneous rocks as structural features in the earth's crust must on

account of the largo scale on which the work has been carried out be 
showu only in models and illustrations. Gilbert's stereogram of the 
Henry Mountains is one of the most striking objects now in this series, 
though attention should also be called to Diller's models of Mount 
Shasta, California; Becker's models of the Washoe district, Nevada; 
Dutton's models of Mount Taylor, New Mexico, and the High Plateaus 
of Utah. 

(G) Veins. — Professor Geikie treats the subject of veins and vein 
formation uuder three heads: (1) Mineral veins, (2) Eruptive veins or 
dikes, and (3) Segregation veins. 

For the present the known eruptive veins in the collections are 
grouped with the nou- volcanic igneous ejections as dike rocks, and here 
we have to do with only the first and third of the above divisions. The 
term vein is used by the above authority to designate "any mass of 
mineral matter which has solidified between the walls of a fissure. When 
this mineral matter has been deposited from aqueous solution or from 
sublimation, it forms what is known as a mineral vein. When it has 
crystallized or segregated out of the component materials of some still 
unconsolidated, colloid, or pasty rock, it is called a segregation vein." 

Simple as such a division may seem it is not always easy, or indeed 
possible to ascertain from a simple examination of the specimens to 
which of the two groups they may belong. As a rule the mineral veins, 
which appear to correspond to the fissure veins of other authors, are 
separated by sharp and well defined walls from the couutry rock, and 
may, and often do, show a well defined banded or comb structure as 
shown in the quartz and rhodochrosite vein from the silver mines at 
Butte, Montana (3856G), and less distinctly in that composed of ruby 
silver and other silver sulphurets together with rhodochrosite from the 
Reese River district, Nevada (15136). The segregation type is less dis- 
tinctly marked, the vein material being welded to the inclosing rock 
owing to the mutual protusion of* the component materials. This type 
of vein is quite common in granitic rocks and is wellshown in the large 
specimens from Rockport, Massachusetts (38757) and Auburn, Maine 
(39057 and 39058). 

IV.— STRATIGRAPHICAL OR HISTORICAL GEOLOGY. 

Under this, the fourth subdivision, is considered the chronological 
succession of the geological formations, the rocks being arranged ac- 
cording to the order of their deposition or ejection. From this series 
fossil forms will to a considerable extent be excluded as belonging 
more properly to the department of paleontology. Only a few of the 
more characteristic forms from each horizon will be shown. 

As at present contemplated the main idea is to show that the same 
geological forces have been in operation and rocks of the same general 
nature been in process of foimation from the earliest time down to the

most recent. This collection is now so far from complete that nothing 
more need be said regarding* it here. 

There are, however, two smaller and less comprehensive collections 
in this subdivision that should be mentioned. The first of these is a 
series of some 250 specimens, in sizes about 5 inches square, repre- 
senting the characteristic rocks of the various geological horizons of 
New Hampshire, as described by State Geologist Hitchcock and Dr. 
George W. Hawes, in Vol. in of the final reports on the Geology of 
New Hampshire. This is accompanied by a proportional column pre- 
pared by Prof. C. H. Hitchcock, and showing on a scale of 1 inch to 
1,000 feet the relative thickness of the stratified rock formations of the 
State. 

The second series is a valuable stratigraphical collection of Canadian 
rocks as prepared by officers of the Canadian Survey for exhibition at 
the Centennial Exposition in 1876. This comprises 854 specimens in 
sizes about 3 by 4 by 1 inch.

SECTION B.— ECONOMIC GEOLOGY. 

Under this head is comprised a large and important exhibit, or series 
of exhibits, selected to illustrate the economic aspects of geological 
science and the extent to which the resources of the mineral kingdom 
have been utilized by man. 

The collections are arranged to show (1) the nature and variety of 
the mineral resources of the United States and (2) the nature and va- 
riety of the more interesting and important useful ores and minerals of 
the world at large. In these collections, as in those of systematic geol- 
ogy, the specimens with a few exceptions have been selected with the 
idea of showing as truthfully as possible the average qualities of the 
material and its mode of occurrence. Care is taken, of course, to pre- 
sent clean and freshly-broken surfaces whenever possible, and, while 
exceptionally fine and beautiful materials are by no means excluded, 
and indeed gladly accepted as rendering the exhibit as a whole more 



32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

attractive, still the typical average material as found at the mine or 
quarry is deemed of first importance. 

The size of the specimens in these collections from necessity varies 
greatly, and whenever space will allow regard is had to the individual 
characteristic of eacli sample. When the material is massive and hom- 
ogeneous throughout the standard adopted is about 5 inches square on 
the face and some 2 inches thick. It is obvious, however, that such 
sizes are not applicable to all grades and kiuds of materials, and in the 
exhibits may be seen specimens varying from less than an ounce to 
over 200 pounds in weight. Material in form of a powder is as a rule 
exhibited in bottles of from 4 to 10 ounces capacity. 

The following list will serve to give an idea of the character and va- 
riety of materials here to be exhibited though, unfortunately, the ar- 
rangement of the exhibition space is not such as to enable us to carry 
it out in a manner as systematic as might be desired. 

(1) Stones used for purposes of building or ornamentation : 

1. The crystalline siliceous rocks, both massive and schistose : Granite, syen- 
ite, diabase, gabbro, diorite, liparite, trachyte, basalt, andesite, gneiss, and the 
crystalline schists.

According to the plan devised the exhibits of this section form two 
independent series, which, as may readily be understood, are in part 
duplicates of one another. These two series are (1) the geographic 
series of ores and useful mineral substances and (2) the systematic series 
of similar objects. Owing, however, to the present lack of proper room 
and cases it has been fouud necessary to group the materials comprised 
in this section under three heads, and inasmuch as they must so remain 
until a new building is constructed or a balcony is placed around the 
walls of the southwest court it will be best to so describe them here. 

These three series then arc : 

First. The collections of building and ornamental stones. 

Second. The geographic series of ores and other useful mineral sub- 
stances. 

Third. The systematic series of ores and other useful mineral sub- 
stances. 

I. — THE COLLECTION OF BUILDING AND ORNAMENTAL STONES. 

Under this head are included such stones as are of value in their 
natural condition for structural or ornamental purposes. Artificial or 
artifically colored materials are excluded. The nucleus of this collec- 
tion was formed by the materials received from Philadelphia at the close 
of the Centenuial Exposition in 1S76. By far the larger portion was, 
however, collected during the investigations connected with the Tenth 
Census in 1880, though mauy important additions have since been made 
iu keeping pace with recent developments. This exhibit comprises 
mainly materials from the United States, though foreign materials are 
by no means excluded, and indeed particular efforts have been made 
toward procuring such as are imported into the United States. 

The specimens of this collection are as a rule cut iu the form of 4-inch 
cubes, the various faces of which are finished as follows : Polished in 
front, drafted and pointed on the left side, drafted rock face on the 
right side, rock face on the back, and smooth sanded on the top and 
bottom. Stones not susceptible of a polish are merely smooth-sanded 
on the front face. The collection is at present arranged by States in 
fourteen floor upright and one wall case on the north side of the west 
south range, while larger specimens occupy two large pyramids in the 
southwest court and special bases wherever they can in our present 
crowded condition be placed to the best advantage. 

This collection now comprises upwards of three thousand specimens 
and has been described in detail in my work entitled "The collection 
of building and ornamental stones in the U. S. National Museum: A 
handbook and catalogue." 1 The following figures relative to the num- 
ber of specimens may, however, be here given :

II. — THE GEOGRAPHIC SERIES OF ORES AND USEFUL MINERAL SUB- 
STANCES. 

In this exhibit, which is confined to the limits of the United States 
with a possibility of extension so as to include Canada and Mexico, the 
materials are arranged on a geographic basis, i. e., by States. The idea 
in mind is to give the publican opportunity to learn almost at a glance 
the character of the mineral product of any particular State or region. 
The exhibit is confined to the wall cases extending entirely around the 
South West Court. 

Entering this court from the West South Eange the series begins 
immediately upon the left.

As may be noticed by a perusal of the lists given above many impor- 
tant localities, both within the limits of the United States and beyond, 
are quite unrepresented. It is to be hoped that friends of the institu- 
tion will be sufficiently interested to contribute the desired materials. 

Concerning the large quantities of foreign materials previously de- 
scribed as formiug a portion of the geographic series of this exhibit 
little need here be said. This for the reason that these collections will 
shortly be thoroughly overhauled, the better class of materials worked 
into the systematic series, and the remainder stored. A great deal of 
this present exhibit can have little interest to the general public and 
must give way to a better class of material. 

The following shows the form of label in use in this series:

III. — THE SYSTEMATIC SERIES OF ORES AND USEFUL MINERAL 

SUBSTANCES. 

This series deals with the same class of materials as are comprised in 
the geographic series, but differs in the method of arrangement, and 
further in that it is not limited to localities in the United States. Much 
of the material here shown is naturally duplicated in the geographic 
series, but owing to its grouping it conveys quite a different lesson. 
As an illustration of this, attention may be called to the collection of 
nickel ores. In the geographic series, ores of nickel as they occur in 
the United States are shown in the State exhibits of Massachusetts, 
Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, and Alaska. 
In the systematic series these same ores are shown, but grouped to- 
gether in such a way as to be readily compared with one another, and 
also with others from it may be worldwide sources, as for instance 
Canada, Sweden, Norway, Prussia, and New Caledonia. 

This series further differs from the first mentioned in that with each 
of the principal metals the ores are supplemented by collections illus- 
trating its method of extraction and the various by-products involved. 

This collection, comprising now some 4,000 specimens, was inaugu- 
rated under the direction of Mr. F. P. Dewey, formerly curator of 
metallurgy, and has been described by him in a handbook entitled 
"Preliminary Descriptive Catalogue of the Systematic Collections in 
Economic Geology and Metallurgy/' This will appear in Part II of the 
Smithsonian Report for 1889-'90. 

While the arrangement of cases adopted by Mr. Dewey has been 
completely changed and much new material added, particularly from 
foreign sources, l still the general scheme at time of writing is practi- 
cally the same, and may be briefly outlined as follows : 

In the case of each metal the series begins with an exhibit of the 
principal minerals of which that metal forms a part. The specimens 
were selected to show so far as possible each mineral in its perfection 
The next step is a series of ores selected to show the material and its 
associated minerals as actually mined. Following these is a third series, 
showing the various stages in the processes of concentration, when 
practiced; and finally a fourth series, representing the processes of ex- 
tracting the metals from the ores and converting them into useful forms. 
These collections include the ores, fuels, fluxes, and all other materials 
entering into the operation, and samples of the final as well as the 
numerous waste and by-products. In this manner are exhibited the 
metallic ores of gold, silver, copper, iron and steel, cobalt, nickel, zinc, 
lead, tin, mercury, and aluminum, while many of the more rare or less 
important are exhibited in specimens only, as is the case with manga- 
nese, chromium, antimony, and bismuth. A fine series of alloys is also 
exhibited under this head. 



Mr. Dewey had limited the collection wholly to minerals from the United States, 



PRELIMINARY HANDBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 43 

Under the head of non-metallic minerals are shown a variety of useful 
mineral substances, including sulphur, the salts used in chemical man- 
ufacture, gypsum, grinding and polishing materials, asbestus and its 
application, miueral fertilizers, fictile materials, and the natural carbon 
compounds, as already noted. 

It is not necessary to go into greater descriptive detail here regard- 
ing this series, as refereuce can be made to the handbook above men- 
tioned. The following summaries are from a previous publication on 
the condition of the department 1 . Changes and additions since made 
have necessitated numerous alterations. 

A— METALLIC MIXEKALS. 

The mineralogy of gold is illustrated by 29 specimens. Of these, 28 
represent free gold, and one sylvanite. Of the free golds 10 represent 
placer gold. 

This series begins with a well-crystallized specimen that is only 
slightly water- worn, and continues through various degrees of rounding 
to a well-worn nugget, weighing an ounce. Fifteen specimens represent 
quartz gold, beginning with crystals in a cavity in fresh quartz, and 
following through various steps of crystallization of the gold and de- 
composition of the matrix to a natural alloy of gold and silver in wholly 
decomposed material. 

Two specimens of crystallized auriferous pyrite represent sulphuret 
gold, and a single specimen represents auriferous slate. 

The gold ores are divided into placer, quartzose, sulphuret, telluride, 
and fusion ores. Beside the placer golds in the mineral series, 5 speci- 
mens illustrate hydraulic gravels, varying from characteristic samples 
to a very rich specimen containing several flakes of visible gold; 9 
specimens, in addition to the quartz gold in the mineral collection, illus- 
trate quartzose ores. These begin with very pure white quartz and 
follow through increasing amounts of other minerals, particularly sul- 
phides in the quartz, to specimens containing large amounts of pyrite, 
chalcopyrite, galena, and blende. The quartzose ores graduate insen- 
sibly into the sulphuret ores, and the two really form one series. 

The 10 sulphuret ores begin with pyrite and quartz and run through 
to pure sulphides; decomposed sulphides follow, and the series closes 
with 2 specimens of mispickle. Five specimens illustrate the telluride 
ores from Boulder County, Colorado. 

The extraction of gold from its ores is illustrated by 3 collections, 
The operation of the hydraulic process is illustrated by 9 specimens 
from the North Bloomfield gravel mine, California; the stamping and

and Refining Works, New Jersey. This collection is interesting as 
showing the refining of copper aud separation of the precious metals by 
the electric current. 

The application of gold is illustrated by 11 specimens showing the 
manufacture of gold leaf. 

Seven specimens illustrate iridosmine. Of these, 4 show the original 
sand, and the gold dust, iridosmine, and black sand separated by wash- 
ing. 

The mineralogy of silver is illustrated by 36 specimens, including all 
the ordinary silver minerals. The silver ores are divided into milling 
and smelting ores; these again are subdivided into free milling and 
roasting milling, aud silver smelting and silver-lead smelting. A. few, 
such as leaching ores and argentiferous copper ores, do not fall into this 
classification. Thirteen specimens illustrate the strictly free-milling 
ores, or such as readily yield to stampiug and amalgamation. These 
carry mostly free silver or cerargyrite. Twelve specimens illustrate 
free-milling ores which require the use of chemicals in the pan ; of these 
8 are charac teristic ores from the Comstock lode. Ores requiring roast- - 
ing before milling are illustrated by 5 specimens, and a complete series 
of 19 specimens from the Ontario mine, Park City, Utah. Besides 
some general characteristic specimens, this includes a section along the 
fifth level aud two sections across the vein on the sixth level. 

The extraction of silver from roasting-milling ores is well illustrated 
by two collections made by the former curator. The first, comprising 
30 specimens from the Ontario mill, illustrates every step iu the process 
from the time the ore is dumped upon the grizzly until the bullion is 
shipped by express, and the tailings are turned to waste. The second 
collection represents in the same full way, with 17 specimens, the opera- 
tion of the Moulton mill at Butte, Montana. 

The treatment of argentiferous copper ores is illustrated by a collec- 
tion of 32 specimens from the Argo Works, Colorado. This collection 
is particularly valuable on account of the assays and aualysis accom- 
panying the specimens. 

The mineralogy of lead is illustrated with 14 specimens of sulphide, 
sulphate, and carbonate. Silver-lead ores are illustrated by 57 speci- 
mens. This series begins with roughly crystallized galena, showing 
the characteristic cleavage, and follows through several varieties of 
galena to the beginning of decomposition, resulting in cerussite and 
anglesite. The association of galena with other sulphides is well illus- 
trated, and a large collection of characteristic samples of cerussite 
closes the series. 

The smelting and refining of base bullion is illustrated in collections 
from the Colorado smelter, South Pueblo, Colorado; the Cheltenham 
Works, St. Louis, Missouri, and the Kansas City Smelting and Refin- 
ing Works, Argentine, Kansas. 

The collection from the Colorado smelter contains 59 specimens,

including a fall suite of the ores, fuels, and flaxes used, the bullion 
and slag produced, and a variety of by products, matte, speiss, flue- 
dust, accretions, etc. The value of the specimens in this case has 
been greatly enhanced by the large amount of information kindly fur- 
nished. The course of the operation has been fully described and plat- 
ted. Nearly every specimen is accompanied by a careful and complete 
analysis. Numerous photographs show the disposition of the works. 

The refining of base bullion is illustrated by a collection of 18 speci- 
mens from the Cheltenham Works. The smelting of a charge contain- 
ing a large proportion of oxidized ores, using iron to reduce the sul- 
phide, and the subsequent refining of the base bullion, are illustrated 
by 13 specimens from the Kansas City Works. 

The southeastern Missouri lead region is well represented by two col- 
lections, one containing 30 specimens from the St. Joe Works, and the 
other 29 specimens from the Desloge Works. These are particularly 
interesting as illustrating two distinct methods of separating the galena 
from the limestone, through which it occurs disseminated. At the St. 
Joe Works the crushed material is delivered directly to the jigs with- 
out any sizing, while at the Desloge Works sizing is very carefully done. 

A series of 28 specimens illustrates the smelting of galena with the 
recovery of the fume as a white paint at the Lone Elm Works, Jopliu, 
Missouri. 

The application of lead is illustrated by 11 specimens showing the 
Dutch process of making white lead. 

The mineralogy of copper is illustrated by 22 specimens. All the 
ordinary copper minerals are shown. The ores of copper are divided 
into metallic, oxidized, and sulphuret ores. The metallic copper ores 
are very well represented by collections from three characteristic Lake 
Superior copper mines, " mass," u amygdaloid," and "conglomerate." 
The mass mines, in which copper is found in large masses, are illus- 
trated by a collection of 31 specimens from the Central mine. The 
amygdaloid mines, in which the copper occurs disseminated through a 
soft amygdaloidal melaphyr, are illustrated by a collection of 6L speci- 
mens from the Osceola mine and 21 specimens from the Osceola mill- 
The conglomerate mines, in which the copper occurs disseminated 
through a tough felsitic conglomerate, are illustrated by 01 specimens 
from the Delaware mine and 17 specimens from the Delaware mill. 
These Lake Superior collections were made with great care for the 
Museum by special collectors. 

The location of nearly every specimen within the mine was carefully 
noted, and the collections include many complete sections. The smelt- 
ing of the separated copper is illustrated by a collection of 17 speci- 
mens from the C. G. Uussey Works, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and 11 
specimens from the Lake Superior Native Copper Works. Taken alto- 
gether, these seven collections, with L'l!) specimens, form a complete 
illustration of the Lake Superior copper industry,

Oxidized aud sulphide copper ores are shown in the collections from 
the various smelting works. The smelting of oxidized ores for 
pig-copper is illustrated by 14 specimens from the Copper Queen 
mine; aud the refining of this pig to ingot is illustrated by 19 speci- 
mens from the Ansouia Brass and Copper Company, Ansonia, Con- 
necticut. The smelting of sulphide ores is illustrated by eight collec- 
tions. The older form of the process is illustrated by 12 specimens 
from the Vermout Copper Company, Ely, Vermont; 23 specimens 
from the Schuylkill Copper Works, Phuenixville, Pennsylvania; and 
14 specimens from the Union Mining Company, Dncktown, Tennessee. 
A newer form is illustrated by 8 specimens from the Orford Works, 
Bergenport, New Jersey, and a modification involving a long roasting 
of the matte in a reverberatory furnace, is illustrated by 34 specimens 
from the St. Genevieve Works, Missouri. The smelting of sulphide 
ores containing silver for the production of a rich matte, is illustrated 
by three collections from Butte, Montana. 

Reverberatory smelting is illustrated by 16 specimens from the Mon- 
tana smelter aud 10 specimens from the Parrott smelter. Shaft-fur- 
nace smelting is illustrated by 11 specimens from the Bell smelter. 
The treatment of copper ores by the Hunt and Douglas wet process is 
illustrated by 14 specimens from the Schuylkill Works, Phceuixville, 
Pennsylvania. 

The application of copper is illustrated by 18 specimens, showing 
more particularly the rolling of copper. 

Seventeen specimens illustrate the mineralogy of iron. The direct 
extraction of iron from its ores is illustrated by 14 specimens from the 
Bogersfield mine and Belmont forge, New York. A large number of 
interesting photographs of the works accompany this collection. The 
manufacture of crucible steel from puddled bar is illustrated by a com- 
plete collection of 28 specimens from the Crescent Steel Works, Pitts- 
burgh, Pennsylvania. 

The manufacture of Bessemer steel is very fully illustrated by a col- 
lection of 74 specimens from the South Chicago Works, taken by spe- 
cial collectors. This collection begins with the ores, fuels, aud fluxes 
used in the blast furnace. Starting with a given charge the metal was 
followed from the blast furnace through each stage of manipulation 
until the rail was rolled, 2:20 minutes after the metal was tapped from 
the blast furnace. Samples were taken wherever possible. To this 
systematic illustration of a blow are added many general specimens, 
particularly a full series of refractory materials. The smelting of mag- 
netite with a mixture of anthracite coal and coke is illustrated by 19 
specimens from the Crown Point, New York, furnace; the smelting of 
a mixture of several (six to eight) different ores with anthracite and 
coke, by 10 specimens from the Warwick furnace, Pottstown, Pennsyl- 
vania; the smelting of very sulphurous and cupreous magnetite from 
a single mine with a mixture of anthracite and coke, by 18 specimens

ing the results obtained by Kirkaldy, of London, in his classic; investi- 
gation of the mechanical properties of Fagersta steel. 

Manganese ores are specially illustrated by 4 specimens. 

Nickel and cobalt : The mineralogy of nickel and cobalt is illustrated 
by 4 specimens and the ores by 18 more. These include samples of 
smaltite from the historic locality of Chatham, Connecticut ; niekel- 
iferous pyrrhotite from Dracut, Massachusetts, and the Gap mines in 
Pennsylvania, Canada, Alaska, Norway, and Sweden ; silicate ores 
from North Carolina, Oregon, and New Caledonia ; arsenides and de- 
rived arseniates from Missouri and Nevada. The application of the 
two metals is illustrated by 43 specimens. 

The mineralogy of zinc is illustrated by 33 specimens. Among these 
are some very fine specimens of crystallized blende from Missouri. In 
addition to these, the ores are represented by 13 specimens. 

Much blende associated with galena and a little pyrite occurs in a 
gaugue of chert in southwestern Missouri and southeastern Kansas. 
The dressing of this material to separate the blende and galena is illus- 
trated by 29 specimens from the South Side mill, Galena, Kansas. The 
extraction of zinc is fully illustrated by five collections. The Glendale 
Works at St. Louis, Missouri, reducing a variety of ores, are illustrated 
by 22 specimens. The Joplin Zinc Works at West'Joplin, Missouri, 
smelting the separated blende from Galena, Kansas, are represented by 
10 specimens. The Rich Hill, Missouri Works, smelting the Joplin ore 
and using a Siemens gas furnace to heat the retorts are illustrated by 17 
specimens. The Passaic Zinc Works, Jersey City, New Jersey, are rep- 
resented by 31 specimens. The^e works treat the complex zinc, iron, 
and manganese ores from Franklin, New Jersey, and produce spelter, 
oxide of zinc, and spiegeleisen. 

The mineralogy of tin is represented by a single specimen, but the ore 
collection includes specimens from nearly every locality in the United 
States, not excepting the original tin discovery at Jackson, New II amp- 
shire. All the principal foreign localities are also represented. The col- 
lection numbers some 50 specimens, and to these are added specimens 
of metal, reduced from the ores, among them a small bar smelted from 
the Jackson ore in 1810. This is undoubtedly the "first tin ever 
smelted in America." 

Antimony is represented by specimens from California, Utah, New 
Brunswick, Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand.

5 specimens. 

Abrading and polishing materials are shown by a fine large series of 
some 200 specimens novaculites, schists, and sandstones in the rough 
and finished state for sharpening edge tools.* Two columns of grind- 
stone as prepared by J. B. Mitchell of Philadelphia may be noted here. 
Each column stands some 7 feet in height, oue composed of 9 and the 
other 13 varieties of grindstones, laid flat, one on another. The stones 
are cut to a scale, being 12 inches in diameter, and each 2 inches of 
thickness representing a diameter of 12 inches in the finished stone as 
actually used. That is to say, stones which in the column are 12 inches 
thick are for actual use made 6 feet in diameter, the thickness remaiu- 
iug the same. All principal varieties both foreign and domestic now in 
use in the United States are represented. The exhibit further com- 
prises 40 specimens corundum and emery both in lumps and in pulver- 
ized form, commercial sizes; 10 specimens of quartz for sandpaper ; 5 
specimens tripoli ; 5 specimens infusorial earth ; 15 specimens pumice,

bestus is shown by 40 specimens.* Sixty specimens show character- 
istic forms of the various phosphates and other mineral substances 
used in the manufacture of fertilizers. 

Fictile materials are illustrated by some 60 specimens, including all 
the usual varieties of clay and kaolin. 

The native compounds in which carbon forms the chief constituent 
are shown in a series of some 500 specimens, which begins with pare 
carbon in the form of diamond and graphite, and follows through coals 
bitumen, and petroleum, ending with natural gas. 

In this series the most important collections are those of anthracite 
coal from the Kohinoor colliery of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal 
and Iron Company, and the very extensive collection of petroleum, 
which includes varieties from all the principal localities of the United 
States, with a very complete illustration of its technology. A few for- 
eign localities are also represented. 

Maps showing the geographic distribution of the ores of iron and 
mercury, of coal, salt, petroleum, and bituminous matter accompany 
this series. It is hoped to add to these others showing the distribution 
of the precious metals as well. A table in each of the exhibition halls 
is supplied with books descriptive of the collections. 

The following show the form of label used in this series:

50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1889. 

Owing to the already crowded condition of the exhibition halls it is 
the present intention to hold the strictly metallurgical portion of the 
exhibit within its present limits, while the remaining portions will be 
expanded indefinitely. This means a general rearrangement of the 
crude materials, excepting those portions needed to illustrate each 
metallurgical process. It is now expected that this work of rearrange- 
ment will be begun as soon as the contemplated new floor in the south- 
west court shall be laid. It is therefore not impossible that the work 
will be well under way by the time this paper shall appear in print.
