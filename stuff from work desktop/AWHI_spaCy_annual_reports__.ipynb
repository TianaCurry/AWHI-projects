      "PREFACE \n",
      "\n",
      "The Smithsonian Institution was established in 1846 as the result of \n",
      "the bequest of James Smithson, an English scientist. He bequeathed \n",
      "his entire fortune to the United States of America for the purpose \n",
      "of founding \"an establishment for the increase and diffusion of \n",
      "knowledge among men.\" For the increase of knowledge, the Insti- \n",
      "tution is continuously engaged in research in many branches of science, \n",
      "as well as scientific expeditions to all parts of the world; the diffusion \n",
      "of knowledge is accomplished principally by the extensive exhibits \n",
      "in its museums, its art galleries, and its zoological park, and by several \n",
      "series of publications which are distributed throughout the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the best known of these series is the Annual Report of the \n",
      "Board of Regents, usually called the Smithsonian Annual Report. A \n",
      "Report has been published every year since 1846, and starting with \n",
      "1849 a General Appendix was included in each volume for the purpose \n",
      "of disseminating information on important and interesting scientific \n",
      "investigations. The \"Advertisement\" introducing the General Ap- \n",
      "pendix to each volume states its function as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "The object of the General Appendix to the Annual Report of the Smithsonian \n",
      "Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discovery in particular \n",
      "directions; reports of investigations made by staff members and collaborators \n",
      "of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on special topics that \n",
      "are of interest or value to the numerous correspondents of the Institution. \n",
      "\n",
      "It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian \n",
      "Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual report required of them by \n",
      "law with memoirs illustrating the more remarkable and important developments \n",
      "in physical and biological discovery, as well as showing the general character \n",
      "of the operations of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this \n",
      "purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would \n",
      "possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual summary of \n",
      "progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by well-known private \n",
      "publishing firms, the Secretary had a series of abstracts prepared by competent \n",
      "collaborators, showing concisely the prominent features of recent scientific prog- \n",
      "ress in astronomy, geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, \n",
      "zoology, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not \n",
      "altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the report of 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of presenting \n",
      "a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original) embracing a \n",
      "considerable range of scientific investigation and discussion. This method has \n",
      "been continued to the present time. \n",

      "The Smithsonian Reports are distributed by the Institution to 3,600 \n",
      "libraries in the United States and 1,700 libraries abroad. Although \n",
      "each volume includes an index, access to the valuable scientific infor- \n",
      "mation in the Reports has been limited by the lack of a general index \n",
      "to the series as a whole. With this thought in mind, Miss Ruth M. \n",
      "Stemple of the Florida State University Library (now at the West \n",
      "Virginia University Library) undertook on her own initiative to pre- \n",
      "pare such an index. The manuscript was reviewed and somewhat am- \n",
      "plified by the Editorial and Publications Division of the Smithsonian. \n",
      "\n",
      "The index is by authors and subjects, the subjects being sufficiendy \n",
      "cross-indexed, it is believed, to enable users to locate any desired \n",
      "subject of interest to them. \n",
      "\n",
      "The subjects treated in Smithsonian Report articles cover almost \n",
      "the entire gamut of scientific disciplines. If any subjects predominate, \n",
      "they would be in the general fields of biology, geology, and anthro- \n",
      "pology — fields with which the Smithsonian has been prominently \n",
      "identified during its more than a century of scientific endeavor. \n",
      "However, articles dealing with all other sciences will be found in the \n",
      "Reports, including astronomy, physics, chemistry, meteorology, \n",
      "medicine, and engineering. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the earlier Reports contain articles of great historical inter- \n",
      "est as recording scientific discoveries which have exerted vast influence \n",
      "on the lives of all of us up to the present time. For example, W. C. \n",
      "Roentgen records in the 1897 Report his discovery of the penetrating \n",
      "radiation which he called X-rays. In the Report for 191 1 we read \n",
      "Marconi's own account of his successful transmission of messages over \n",
      "distances by \"wireless.\" The beginnings of practical human flight are \n",
      "recorded by Wilbur Wright in the 1902 Report and Orville Wright \n",
      "in that for 1914. \n",
      "\n",
      "Scientific breakthroughs that led to spectacular developments are \n",
      "exemplified by Ernest Rutherford's article in the 1938 Report record- \n",
